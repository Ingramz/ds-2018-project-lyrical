Amazing Blondel,"Come I'1 take you to town with me
For to see the fine weaver of words
Come and take the walk down with me
For to see all the things you had heard
Oh, the road is short but tiring
And the morning is warm and new
Come I'11 take you to town with me
If the company pleases you

Peasant ladies and gentlemen
Will come to spend the day
Gather trinkets as they dance
And frolic on their way
 
Will you buy will you buy my oranges
Will you buy from me a friend
Won't you buy from a lady
If you have some silver to spend

Salty fisherman you are
The pride of all, you know
Who's your fancy with today?
What prize you have to show?

I'1 give the biggest catch my friend
That ever spread the floor
It yours is not the fairest face
I've ever seen before",Weaver's Market,1973
Amazing Blondel,"It's all very well you saying
I don't like what you're playing
You know your bird's been graying, 
Under wing
You don't have time to capture
The picture that your after
And it's too late to naturally change

Looking down, a pleasant sight, 
The re's no time to blink an eye.

I know you like the feeling
Of nature's open ceiling
It's time leave the pealing
Of the bells
You don't look very strong lad
They say it can't be all bad
At least not if you're half mad
When you go

Looking down, a pleasant sight, 
The re's no time to blink an eye.

So now your eyes are clearing
And your strength is reappearing
And what's your most endearing
Quality
So spread your invitation
And take some consolation
In knowing that salvation
Tips her hat

Looking down, a pleasant sight, 
The re's no time to blink an eye.",Leaving of the Country Lover,1977
Amazing Blondel,"It's easy for me
To tell you the pangs of love
You see the best in everything
And circle like a dove
Oh with those easy living eyes
You see them burn and can feel you're growing wise
You know your place and turn together all the ties
You cover up and keep her steady as she lies

You take to laughing
And singing songs of joy
And take to walking in the evening
With your lover boy
Oh if the very song of spring

Could make you happy then girl that's the one I'd sing

And if you needed love then that is what I'd bring
I'd never let you stay alone in anything

Flattery is easy
When all you have to do
Is look into each other's face
And give the best of you
Oh, you have such a lucky line

You must be due to say t he very same of mine
I think it's there to make it better all the time

If night time wants to win then my it's got to shine",Lesson One,1977
Amazing Blondel,"Here's to my acquaintance, and companion
Lift your glass
I love you, and leave you
I do, give you, all my best
Here's to lovely lasses
Who by now are sleeping sound
We miss you, and kiss you, 
We will, until we can no longer hope

And I would spread the softest ground, 
For you to walk around, 
If I could be your right hand, 

I'd bless the seed that I would sow, 
And hope that it would grow
Into a sight to hold you

Here's to my acquaintance, and companion
Lift your glass
I love you, and leave you
I do, give you, all my best
Here's to lovely lasses
Who by now are sleeping sound
We miss you, and kiss you, 
We will, until we can no longer hope

And we could have the richest thing
To make your songbird sing
A tale to haunt the evening.
Then I would give you every note
Of every song I wrote
For them to ring forever

Here's to my acquaintance, and companion
Lift your glass
I love you, and leave you
I do, give you, all my best
Here's to lovely lasses
Who by now are sleeping sound
We miss you, and kiss you, 
We will, until we can no longer hope",Young Man's Fancy,1977
Amazing Blondel,"Silence, stillness hangs brittle by the breeze

Break it not, leave it free, 
For that quiet is sound to me, 
Lilting from each flower, a melody to see, 

Mellow meadow, your mood steeped in cadence
View each note, see it pass

Sustained by the swaying grass, 

Treasured tune of nature, sedate supernal mass

Landscape splendour, spirit mender, 
No extent of beauty equalls yours

Season sender, harsh and tender
Answer to all yearnings and yet their cause
 
Shafts of sunlight shine thinly through the trees

Golden rays, parched with dust
Thirst for clarity and just
A little glimpse of life down beneath this foliar crust

Womblike woodland, one chaste copse confined, 

Stay untouched, undefiled, 
All God's garden growing wild, 

Blooming forth in freedom so sweetly reconciled

Landscape splendour, spirit mender, 
No extent of beauty equalls yours
 
Unending, time suspending, 

Terrestrial creation
 
Rainstorm rapids rush swollen down the slopes, 
Cleansing all in their path, 
Not one stone left unbathed
Just waterpools and wormscasts remain as aftermath, 

Holy hillside, the alter of the plains, 

All is seen from your brow, 
To that face the four winds bow, 

As maji to the Saviour and oxen to their plough","Landscape [Extract from ""The Paintings""]",1993
Amazing Blondel,"Your glances are showing, 
That love's seed is growing, 
It's shoot sprouting, flowing sincerely.
And tho' you'll not say it
You hope and you pray it
Will bloom and display itself clearly.

Take these arms, clasp them hard
Love is all that matters now so forget your coy facade
Take this heart, scathed and scarred
It is all I have to give and it's all I'll expect you to guard

Your face is telling
That love's grain is swelling
All bounderies excelling, steadily

But you'll not admit it, 
You'll try to outwit it, 
And lose, so you'll quit it, quite readily

Take these arms, clasp them hard
Love is all that matters now so forget your coy facade
Take this heart, scathed and scarred
It is all I have to give and it's all I'll expect you to guard

Sweetheart, sweetheart, please let me now
Your true feelings, the ones you daren't show

Your barriers are breaking, 
And steps that I'm taking, 
Will find out you're faking indifference.
For your eyes are speaking, 
With looks slowly weakening, 
Saying love's what you're seeking, in preference.

Take these arms, clasp them hard
Love is all that matters now so forget your coy facade
Take this heart, scathed and scarred
It is all I have to give and it's all I'll expect you to guard",Toye,1995
Amazing Blondel,"Strains of delight come greet my ears
Such music sweet can ease all fears
As windy waves upon the shore
Do calm the cormorant by their roar

Wistfully watching I wonder
As ships go out to sea
At mariners yonder
And how their lives must be
With oceans to wander coves of tranquility
Oh none could be fonder
Of his sailors life than he

Sights of beauty come soothe my eyes
Paint pictures pure to flay disguise
Uncharted coastlines to appraise

Through foul or fair
All tempests you'll bear
Yet show not a care
For the danger you're in
You leave all behind
Trade kin and your kind
For capstan to wind
And a yarn to spin

Idyll of grandeur excite my mind
Conjure up peace with adventure entwined
Crystal clear fathoms and myriad wrecks 
Attired in booty arrayed on their decks",Seascape,1999
Amazing Device,"I'm weakening
and I don't know how much more of this world I can stand

Inject into me
Flowing through my blood stream

Now I can't go out in the condition that I'm in
With my eyes rolled back and my heart pounding
The hallucinations start
and their leaving their marks.......Your needles in my arms

Kill the ache inside of me
For the sake of sanity
My amphetamines
(Now I can't go out in the condition that I'm in)
Kill this craving for my saving grace

Hemorrhaging
The blood is rushing
I'm alittle dizzy, I'm alittle dizzy now
I can't go out in the condition that I'm in
With my eyes rolled back and my heart pounding
The hallucinations start
and their leaving their marks
Your needles in my arms

Kill the ache inside of me
For the sake of sanity
My amphetamines
(Now I can't go out in the condition that I'm in)
Kill this craving for my saving grace

Your soul is the drug
It rolls of the tongue

It rolls off the tongue........

Just like feeling a familiar touch a junkie just can't get enough
a fiend I guess will always be a fiend.

Kill the ache inside of me
For the sake of sanity
My amphetamines
(Now I can't go out in the condition that I'm in)
Kill this craving for my saving grace

My Saving Grace.
It rolls off of the tongue.",My Saving Grace,2003
Amazing Device,"She plays it discreet
She thinks no one sees
We noticed

If it's not the first time
Then tell me
When will it be the last?
She's battered and broken
Her will
Her face
Her trust
And her faith

Amazing Transparent Man,"If I could see into your heart
Then would I know just where to start?
Because I'm lost and I need to be found
Crazy as it sounds
I need you around

If I could stand to be on my own
Then I would probably just leave you alone
But I'm gonna feel this way till I'm six feet underground
Crazy as it sounds
I need you around

Turning, tossing and turning
My love is burning me down

If I could change one thing in this world
I'd change your mind and make you my girl

Amazing Transparent Man,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Bitch,2003

Nonbelievers are treating Jesus like a silly fad
Weak like the spot Achilles had they got me really mad
Talking 'bout relationships they never really had
The kill me dog but it's not about the skills we have
Because the city is sickly the need the Balm on Gilead
Known for doin' things that's odd to see like the Iliad
Like standing on top of the water like a lily pad
The Life Giver who turns my heart like a river
From when it was trashy and when it was nasty like lives
He fills His quiver with children with who follow His orders
Sons and daughters
Who've been changed like dollars to quarters
Holler, he'll pour you grace and then give you some more 
Give you wisdom when you're in a trial like a court case
Can't show you the pure face but you can get the pure taste goodness
Never running out like you're raw space
All sing to the only acceptable offering
All things reconciled by His death on the cross beam
With blood that was clean, and blood that ""ca-ching!""
He purchased men so that must mean worship the King
God the Son, the only One with a plan to redeem
Stronger that the Army-Navy, Air force, and the Marines
Elohim the A to Z and all that's in between
The Supreme who could have let us fall yet intervened
Called the elect made sure we accept
Roots us in Christ so we can grow like a chia pet
So hail the King, priest and prophet

Of God you can peep with your optic

In the eyes of this world my life is trife
They don't understand when I say I've died to Christ died to my rights
Livin' selfless, render myself helpless
Trustin' God, set my heart where his eternal wealth is
What else is there to live for, what else is there to hope in still
I bow to Christ with a broken with a broken will
Becoming broken bread and poured out wine
When seen with the natural eye authentic
Christian livin' blows the mind
What validates my faith go check
You'll see from the holy scroll to the codex
That God inspires the whole text
The scriptural facts will surprise
And paralyze you like broke necks
Shake up your whole set
Leave your soul vexed
I pray you dream of his holiness and wake up in cold sweats
Can't dissolve the mixture
No matter how odd the picture
You can't deny the God of scripture equipped with tha
Truths that transform becoming a thorn where man swarm
We bring the real when we kingdom build upon the rock
He's the one you can either stand on
Or be the one whom he lands on
Weather the sinkin' sand storms
Until you realize there's no other God
Worth taking a chance on
We keep our hands on the plow breaking up the fallow ground
While Christ can found seek him and follow now

It's been told that men without
Christ would face insurmountable odds
And the greatest of these would be a close encounter with God
(and you don't want that) even though your free to give it a try
100% before the Most High
Either live it or die
Cause ever since Adam sinned life was done
But thanks to Christ the Son
When Death marked us up with it's pricin' gun
Jesus came and smiled and paid
For us all and brought the work of sin to an
End like the child labor law
When the wild and wayward saw
That in Jesus God forgave us all who repented
And consented that our way was wrong
Then they saw why the truth rocks us
So hard enough to work arduous
To bogard yo just pardon us. Like the
Marginous distance between mars and us
Understand men are from dust and
Smart enough or large enough to harness
Up and jump the marvelous distance
Between us and God we just tarnish up His image
My mission is to open eyes
And I'm steady mobilizin'
Because of the hope I find in Jesus, tougher than
Teflon, hung with the common thugs
Though He had more class than Upper Eshelon
I'm in love with the way He put us back together, life was broke
Then Christ came in handy like Black and Decker
The fact is pleasure could never measure up black
To Christ so tell us where's your treasure at
This song was not on the tapes you gave us
So I assume that you have it and can get the lyrics",Hands in the Air,1999
Ambassador of Love,"[Chorus]
One day I won't cry no more
Can't wait for the day when people won't die no more
Daddy's won't say, bye no more; lie no more
In the streets bullets won't fly no more

Won't feel no pain no more
Won't have to push, pull, won't have to strain no more

Won't have to walk lame no more
Won't have to play the game no more.

One day we takin off baby and ever since the Lord saved me
I've been waitin for the day we can say, it's all gravy
It's all crazy tryin seeing to see life when its all hazy
How can I persist to do right when I'm all lazy?
Feel me? Too much pain it all ails me
Vexed, cause I can feel the effects of the Fall daily
The pain in my chest it strong, let's get on
Come Lord, quick, bring on the eschaton
End the search, start the new earth, flex your true worth
Honor your Son, let Him come, perfect the new birth
And We don't gotta prove that God is cool
Just know when God is through no more godless rule
So I'm anxious to praise the Ancient of Days
My brain's still amazed at how I can see that pain is a phase
Soon to be eclipsed at the Son's return
When we get what He gives and not what we've earned

[Chorus]

There's coming a day that'll be much better than now
No more hurts. no more work by the sweat of your brow
No more drunk drivers drivin all out of control
No more flats and being stuck on the side of the road
Believe me, no more turning on the T.V
Seeing kids say, for the price of coffee you can feed me
In fact, no more anthrax in the mail
No jail, no blizzards, no twisters, no hail
It'll be the end of rain and the end of planes
Being hijacked and flown into window panes
It'll be nice just, imagine a world that'll be righteous
No more Middle East crisis
No more drugs, and no more thugs and pimps
No more beat-downs, and no more getting mugged for timbs
No need for ramps cause no need for wheel chairs
No need for weaves cause you'll feel your real hair

[Chorus]

One day when this life is over we will live forever
together with our king

Christ is the Rock and believe me the Rock's steady
He drops heavy, so stop screaming I'm not ready
God said He's coming like a thief kid so peep it
He'll creep it's meant to be unknown like a secret
This is what many are having beef with
Gods rotisserie style can make a brothers teeth grit
Cause He's quick but according to our concept of speed
Looking at man He thought about the depth of our need
So what this means is, He's not slow, the King is
Waitin to bring kids into Christ where real Bling is
So they can sing His praise because they've seen this
God spill His blood to show love at its zenith
He proved He cut for them
Look what He gave up for them
Paid His life since you can't pay bucks for sin
Justice then teamed up with long suffering
Big ups to Him who gave you and me time to trust in Him

[Chorus]",Cry No More,2002
Ambelique,"Free as the wind
Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
You crawled on my land
Now I grow in your hand
Always like the first time
Unlike the others
They're so-so
So called lovers
Theirs is the push that comes to shove
But not in our evolution
It's natural
From great to grand
True love is never really planned
And wipes the memory of those who came
Before our evolution
It's natural
And with you see me walk on air
I know that I can do it
When you're holding tightly to my sleeve
The one with my heart upon it
Hard as a mountain range
Bright as a harvest moon
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join our show
Every dog must have its day
Everyone's a winner
And every time the lights go down on us
I'm the beginner 
How lady luck has changed
""So long Salem""
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join the show
Free as the wind
Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
An interlude
With haunting melodies of nursery rhymes
Singing the changes, singing the changes, singing...
I hear talk of classroom drama
Maybe it's a kind of psychodrama
Children, the mirrors of our yesterdays
On the land out of the sea
Blowing in the breeze
Mind over metaphor
Fall in love with innocence
Don't dally long with diligence
Stand up choose me
Don't refuse me
They pawned our world of peace
A flock of sheep to fleece
Our flood of love won't cease
No harm can come our way
And it's easy to see what sets us apart
From the creatures still on the ocean bed
Our evolution it's natural
It goes from great to grand
Falls into place like something that we planned
When you curl your arms around my frame
Or curl your lips around my name
And do just what comes natural
The first thing on your mind
Do just what comes natural
I prefer your kind of human nature",Human Nature,1997
Ambelique,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha

They were young and they had each other

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind

I only hope that I've learned from my sin
I heard a voice when I was thirteen
Got baptized, washed up clean
But the world has a way, if you know what I mean
To scuff you up again and again

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

Now, somebody made every natural thing
From the soul, inside out to Saturn's rings
How my baby smiles and how Ray Charles sings
Of course we were created
The clouds make rain, the ocean makes sand
The earth breathes fire, and lava makes land
Now that took a mighty hand
And a wild imagination

Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

The dreams I dreamed came back ten-fold
The friends I have, the woman I hold
I look down and I'm on streets of gold
After all the mud along the way
And sometimes the big old mystery
Just leans right on me
And whispers that I'm home and I am free
And I'll take that any day

Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!

Where justice reigns and God resides

From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies pursue me
You'll keep me safe from harm

No peace it seems I will find again
I find that place, a secret place
A place where I can go

From the rain and storm

You'll keep me safe from harm

That's all I keep thinking of
But I can't make the water move
Water moves on its own
Gotta be okay for a while alone
Look out the window, feeling the glare
Wish I knew how to come up for air
But when I can't see the light
And I wanna hide
When I feel like I'm losing my mind

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

I'm so tired and I know why I spent too long
Trying to change all these thing I can't control
And now I finally let it go
Watch the sky open up and turn the fall into a dive
See that I'm gonna be just fine

Al I want is to feel strong
Well I know who I can count on

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

You gotta sing it out, sing it all to yourself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of you
And it's time to listen",All to Myself,2017

We made the ship that sailed us on
But now all our problems remain unsolved
Our voices don't carry at all

We drew a line into the sand
And wrestled with our final feelings
They'll all be frozen in this moment
We have no messages left to send

And this love wants not to hinder our evolution
It only wants the best for you
The best for me

We traveled time and seasons passed
And really stopped us in our tracks
We flew through cherries into broken glass
And lived to see the aftermath

And when they ask us
When they ask what led to this conclusion
We'll tell them we did the best we could
Yes we did

I live in a cave, dark and dripping decay, far from the light of day
Like a starless night
Come this far, you'd think that I 
Would have no trouble trying to walk a few more miles
But as if it's scrolling through words and pictures like I'm paralyzed

Nobody knows, nobody knows how I feel
Nobody sees my soul
And when the wind blows, I just wanna blow away
I wanna say goodbye to today

Wanna hide, feel too shaky to move through the world outside
So I'm just here wasting, wasting away
And I woke up from a nightmare
Everyone I know disappeared
And like I knew along, I did not belong
Have nowhere to go, be someone nobody knows

Nobody knows, nobody knows how I feel

The glow of a Scorpio sun beats down from high above
I haven't been the same since you went away
I have come undone
I can hardly wait for the end of the day
And when the morning comes

Don't need no coffee, I'm wide awake
I'm not much for sleeping when your love is at stake
I go out walking, I don't know what to do
'Cause I can't think about anything but you, oh

Baby, I need you in a serious way
Can't give you all this love when you push me away
I'm at the mountain and I'm strong enough
I'm gonna run till I fall down in your love

And while I'm underwater, I wonder where you are
And though I know I can't be under long
I can't ignore my heart

I'm gonna get a motorcycle too
I'm gonna learn to ride, ride next to you
Everyone has noticed this courage I've found
'Cause I don't fear a thing when you're around

We home, let's go
I know, we back
We home, let's go

Check it out
Born this way, the universe wasn't formed in a day
Praise the Lord and pray, we the children of God
Better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith, but it's hard
What more could I say?
Feelin' cursed, so I talk this way
Gotta write what I'm livin' in graffiti
It's the hood hieroglyphics
So I'm lookin' for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin'
You could picture me holdin'
You could never picture me foldin'
Refuse to beholden to your racist image of a Black man
Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It's all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the Real You?
I don't know it's still you
How can I tell if you under a spell
Did the Fake You kill you?
Do they pass the mic in the afterlife?
If so let me spit flows
Good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away
Castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a Castaway
Because I feel like I'm swimmin' on an island
When I'm gettin' introspective, that's radio silence
When I'm fuckin' up program directives, that's radio violence

You're the one who wants to slow me down
I'm a criminal when you're around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain't no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I'll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that's a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Are we growin' apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah's Ark
We battin' down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin' them chemtrails
My intel says they makin' people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off it don't end well
I ain't know you like to get wet, dog, like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin' like a fish scale
Till' you chasin' a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale
It's criminal

You're the one who wants to slow me down
I'm a criminal when you're around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to attack me?

Born this way, Capricorn, L.A
On the day of January 15th
Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb
Formed from the clay
Existing shifting from the essence uplifting
In the presence just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled the blessing, blissed up
My first breath in outer space
I kissed death in it's face
No identity complex, it gets left in it's place
Proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood
Corpuscle boils, I'm pressin' issues
It's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's business to play and get paid
During this clone of her DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire water, elixir of liquor with soft 
Or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom
Poor black, white sexy texture of lovers like jungle fever
Wild zebras to make this fetus, brother, the son of my father
I want to hear my one Shawki, and my daughter
Aja lecture selections in musical meters
In physics you should explore or visit more exquisite shores in districts
Take a breather, believe in your epic
God, remember you are a descendant of natural leaders
Extended from both levels in Bethlehem and even need 'em
In new testaments, heaven's an image in books
Messages, read 'em
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge in Europe, the mathematics of Mayans and metholithic structures
Evidence frequencies evades us
We're just the latest in production
Who made it out of the pure star dust
That made in His image, but God is greatest",Radio Silence,2017

The time I made you feel real bad
Now you
Why you, darling?

I should have said I love the memories
I could have given all of the world to see
But you
Now you, darling

Amber Mark,"I bark, you bite
Whatever it is, it ain't right
It's not intentional, but tension's running high
My time, your world
I sit back and watch it unfurl
They can't blame me 'cause I'm worried about my girl

We fight every night and day
And make up for it right away
This is driving me insane
But I still love you anyway
Yeah anywhere you want to put it
Bite my tongue or bite the bullet
Said a couple things I shouldn't
I would take back if I could

If things fall apart again
I know you know we can go back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end
I know you know we can go back to being just friends
We can go back to being just friends

Speak once, think twice
Looks like you put me on ice
The ice is melting every time we dim the lights
I'm dim-witted, deal with it
You said something slick, I didn't get it
And now I wonder if our love is counterfeit

All these questions on my mind
Is this all some sort of sign?
Is this love or am I blind
Or are we headed for decline?
I decline to answer that
But I'm inclined to state the facts
We stay on each other's back
Because opposites attract

If things fall apart again
I know you know we can go back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end
I know you know we can go back to being just friends
I know you know we can go back to being just friends

I know you know we can go back to being just friends

I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high

May not be correct but I can't get enough

Been a while since I been back round
And you're all on my mind, showing love
So meet me at 1:13
Shit, you might not recognize me
Dripping in these diamonds
And wrapped all in this Gucci

I know we don't speak
But you're still on my feed
Every time that you post
And I'm liking what I see
It's been a while

Is my money and my clothes 

Boy, let me put you on, show you my glow up
I wanna see your face, you should come pull up
Oh, let me put you on, I want something more
Maybe this time you're what I'm looking for

Do you remember way back in the 212?
You were all with your boo
Even though I had a man
Deep down, I always knew
That between us there was something
That I could not explain
But I guess I was just too young then
'Cause now I know what it means

I know we don't speak

See I'm the big bass, long dreads, big braids
On my way to you, bed stop, J train
bright in LA, TT 'cause she lives in Long Island 
shout out, big diss, my mom's brother in Harlem 
Took me to the fifth spot where I begged for your pardon
And I gave you my number
And I'm glad that you called it

Amber Morgan,"Some things I've done make my conscience burn
My very spine shudder and squirm
I only hope that I've learned from my sin
I heard a voice when I was thirteen
Got baptized, washed up clean
But the world has a way, if you know what I mean
To scuff you up again and again

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

Now, somebody made every natural thing
From the soul, inside out to Saturn's rings
How my baby smiles and how Ray Charles sings
Of course we were created
The clouds make rain, the ocean makes sand
The earth breathes fire, and lava makes land
Now that took a mighty hand
And a wild imagination

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

The dreams I dreamed came back ten-fold
The friends I have, the woman I hold
I look down and I'm on streets of gold
After all the mud along the way
And sometimes the big old mystery
Just leans right on me
And whispers that I'm home and I am free
And I'll take that any day

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry",Poetry,2005

To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

How I used to kick it on the front porch

And how I used to lay back and smoke weed

And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you

I wish that I could touch you now

Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof

And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand

Brought my baby out to play today
Thinking when I saw 'em arguing ""this can't be good"" I told her, ""come on, come on, baby""
(Time to go)
Now we lying right here dying and it hurts I couldn't save her, why they'd have to shoot my baby, God?
(Damn near all of you)
Over colors she would color wit tomorrow I know they'll both forget us when it's time to go
(Time to go) (goin' home)
Bought her building blocks just yesterday
So excited to play but now there's blood soaking her clothes and we ain't have nothing do wit it
Why they have to trip, we was just out here enjoying the day and now they had to come and ruin shit
(Damn near all of you)
Now we laying on the ground and everything around me fading 'cause I know deep down it's time for us to
(Time to go home to)
I was having fun, then mama told me it's (time to go)
Then I heard a thing go bang-bang-bang-bang-bang now we lying and it's time for us to (time to go)
She grabbed me, tried to run but it was far too late and now we staring at the sun she waiting on me
(Damn near all you)
I hope you don't forget us and I pray that God forgive you when it's finally your time, your time
(Time to go home to)

Sweet songs and halos and and I'm so undistracted
Laughing at the winds and long goodbyes and ashes
I will find my strength at last
My mind captive
I'm going
I'm going, going home

We was staring at the sun too
We was shooting at each other and now we both dying too
I got a family and I know he got a family too
I'm praying to my God and he praying to his too
He fighting for his family and I'm fighting for mine too
Money, oil, land, gold
The only plan was to make it back safe with both my feet and hands but now it's (time to go) 

Well now I'm on my way back going (it’s time to go)
They'll give my wife a flag and tell my sons how brave their dad was
And when I make it back home (it’s time to go)
I hope they save the letters, pics and know how much I wished
I wished it wasn't time for me to (damn near all of you)
But know I had 'em on my heart and I ain't want no Purple Heart
I'm sorry baby but I gotta go (it’s time to go home to)

I can't say that I'm scared as this pain sets me free
I have lived without love, without all that I need
See the marks that I bare, and the shame that runs deep
You have made every moment so worthless to me and
I can't understand this at all

'Cause I don't want to see our lives destroyed by dismay
In these times of try, we live or die again

You're my summer that fades, to these cold autumn days
You're my keepsake, my friend, and my fears
You're the strength that's inside and I swear on my life
I will always be there by your side

It's hard to live without love with the chance that you may
Find the whole world is waiting to hear what you say
From the heart through your veins to the answers that came
Here to save me, to guide me, to show me the way

So I don't want to see our lives destroyed by dismay
In these times of try, we live or die again

So take this time to see that I
Can't leave this all to chance
So take this time to see that I
Have hope that lies will end

Who was taken you from crayons to perfume

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

And weak from strong that's a lot to learn

Remember, Christ, our Savior was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

And unto certain Shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not,"" said the angel
""Let nothing you affright 
This day is born a Savior of pure or Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might""

Amber Riley,"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go

So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

I know you’re trying to forget

The holes in my apologies, you know
I’m trying hard to take it back

Watch the flower's waking up

Mother with her child in tow
Change old paper for silver coins
Lose myself in all this noise

Counting down, one minute left
Cotton stops its jog in place
I hold it warm against my face

It's washing day, it's washing day

In my back pocket, curled and creased
My old notebook, filled with you
Our secrets now just streaks of blue

It's all a mess but beautiful
This emptiness, a gift I hold
I write a poem with you in mind
And leave the memories behind
I leave the memories behind

Il n'y a que Le Créateur qui s'est fait tout seul
Quand est-ce qu'on stoppe? Il n'y a plus de chaleur
Laisse-moi t'accoster deux secondes, ça vient du cœur
T'écoute mon rap au stéthoscope, mon shrab est père
Et je suis tellement fier, j'suis loin d'être mafieux
Mais j'agirai comme un parrain si tu touches à ma filleule
En amour, j'suis hyper sauvage, tout est vrai dans cet album
J'ai juste mélangé quelques histoires et changé les personnages
On est qu'une infime parcelle, ressens-tu l'inertie?
Peu importe qui j'suis, mes paroles sont universelles
Et toi qui craches sur moi
Si tu m'connaissais, j'suis sûr qu'on serait potes
Je t'en veux pas, j'aurais peut-être
Fait comme toi contre un mec comme moi, à l'époque
Avant, je voulais me prouver des trucs
J'avais peur donc j'voulais me battre
Depuis que j'ai frôlé la mort
J'ai plus peur d'rien et j'veux plus m'battre
J'fournis les graines, j'me dis qu'mon large public peut les semer
La vie est courte, les années passent plus vite que les semaines

Si je peux le faire, t'en es capable
Nan, je ne suis pas un mec à part
Nan, je ne vis pas dans un bête d'appart'
Ne te fie pas à ma tête à claque
Et les gens m'voyaient déjà
Noyé, ils me croyaient même pas
J'ai la peau pâle mais j'aime partager
L'mafé au foyer, des fois, tu croyais quoi?
Et puis pipelette, moi, je vois les hommes comme la sape
J'essaye et j'enlève l'étiquette si j'estime qu'ils sont à ma taille
Et j'le paye parfois, les gens n'sont pas ceux que l'on croit, en-soi
Le sérum d'amour, c'est l'genre de boisson que l'on boit sans soif
J'en bois cent boîtes, ondulation de la population
Ils ont trop bu en s'en lassant, copulation, ovulation
Aucune action n'est sans conséquence
Mais certains accidents sont bénéfiques
Regarde ton nombril avant d'enfoncer les filles
Dis à ceux qui te jugent que c'est juste un vice de plus
J'ai plus d'amour pour les salopes que pour tous ces fils de pute
Je revois rayonner les contours de tes cheveux auréolés
Le soleil, j'suis désolé pour tous ceux qui t'ont ri au nez
Je sais que c'est dur d'se sentir vivant
Dans cette noirceur étouffante, toi et moi
En vision infrarouge, on ressemble à des fantômes
Pardon aux gens que j'aime que j'ai plus l'temps d'voir

Please forgive me
While we're apart
I'm doing all of this for you
Keep holding on making true
And now that we have gone this far
Wasn't it that we changed the truth
The only thing I need is you

Je ressens toujours de la mélancolie sur les quais d'la gare
Je repense aux vacances d'été de la CAF
Depuis, j'ai vécu des choses, des expériences avec la came
Et la musique qui m'a sauvé
Rien de plus précieux que les clés d'la cave
Tu veux cher-tou que des chèques, man
C'est le Sheitan qui t'achète l'âme
Chaque fois que tu jettes l'arme dans la chette-ca que t'as chez toi
Chacun ses addictions, les moins que rien se multiplient
Ils veulent se soustraire à ma division dès qu'il faut payer l'addition
On traite nos corps comme des déchetteries
Consomme la mort en s'disant qu'on va pas s'empêcher d'vivre
Et j'y ai pensé la tête dans les toilettes
T'es un esclave quand t'es plus maître de toi-même
À l'heure où j'écris ça, j'ai arrêté d'fumer et d'boire
J'ai arrêté, mon Dieu, pourvu que ça dure
Je me sens tellement mieux
Ouais, j'ai arrêté, mon Dieu
J'ai arrêté, mon Dieu",Etre Humain,2015
Amber Simone McNeil,"Je vois les lumières de ma ville, je vois les jeux d'ombres
Je suis comme la nuit, chaque jour, je tombe
Les 'iens cherchent du molly, mes collègues te montrent la came
Quelques jambes dans mon lit, quelques pieds dans mon placard

Ce train de vie m'atteint, chaque jour est un samedi
Cinq heures du matin, nouvelle insomnie
Une partie de poker, du pain sur la planche à billets
Non, strip poker, OK, je ne veux plus voir de blanche habillée
Quand mes gavas font les fous, les voisins font les fous
Mon mot d'excuse dans l'ascenseur
""Bonsoir, veuillez vous faire foutre""
Et chaque fois que mes potos boivent trop
Comportements de gamins

Tu dalla rabbia ormai non ci vivevi più 
E adesso che siamo tornati insieme 
Ti dico t'amo e tu non me lo dici mai 

E adesso giura, adesso giura 
Adesso giura che non hai paura 
Che sia una fregatura dirmi ""amore mio"" 
Perché un amore col silenziatore 
Ti spara al cuore e pum! Tu sei caduto giù

E se prometto poi mantengo 
M'appartieni e se ci tieni 
Tu prometti e poi mantieni 
Prometto, prometti 

Ti giuro amore un amore eterno 
Se non è amore me ne andrò all'inferno 
Ma quando ci sorprenderà l'inverno 
Questo amore sarà già un incendio 
Lo grido cento mille volte a sera 
Ma disperata come una preghiera 
Non voglio più svegliarmi sola sola 
Se non ci sarai 

Prometti, per sempre sarà 
Prometti, indietro non si tornerà 

Se c'è una crisi la mandiamo via 
Perché i problemi tuoi sono problemi miei 
Bisogna dirci tutto fra di noi 
E a tutti gli altri poi non li diremo mai 

E adesso giura, adesso giura 
Adesso giura sopra al mio diario 
Dove c'è la tua foto che hai dedicato a me 
Che ho consumato con i baci e pianti 
Ed io per colpa tua non piangerò mai più

Ambros Seelos Orchestra,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

And as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.

I feel such purpose
A reason for being alive
And I want to know
I want to know

Sometimes it seems
There was meant to be more
Than this rush and this battle to living
And there's the times
We've all tasted the space
That you know when we feel that we're giving

So take some time
To think about this
I'm blinded now
I'd like to see
And I want to know
I want to know

I want to see through all the barriers
That were created before I was born
Were they put out there just to guide me
Or keep the weak from becoming strong

I want to know
I want to know

Still in my heart
I feel such purpose
A reason for being alive
And I want to know

There's no place that I can really be
Out into my own

So I'm runnin' away
I have got to be alone
I'm runnin' away

Afternoons we spent alone

There's no place that I can really be

I never spend a day

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Ambrosia Parsley & the Elegant Too,"There’s a nail in the door
And there’s glass on the lawn
Tacks on the floor
And the TV is on
And I always sleep with my guns when you’re gone

There’s a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor
And some cash on the nightstand
When I’m all alone the dreaming stops
And I just can’t stand

What should I do I’m just a little baby
What if the lights go out
And maybe and then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
So goodnight moon I want the sun
If it’s not here soon
I might be done
No it won’t be too soon ’til I say goodnight moon

There’s a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he’s been watching me
And there’s footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall

Something’s under the bed
Now it’s out in the hedge
There’s a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

What should I do I’m just a little baby
What if the lights go out
And maybe I just hate to be all alone outside the door he followed me home
So goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it’s not here soon
I might be done
No it won’t be too soon ’til I say goodnight moon

Well you are up so high
How can you save me?
When the dark comes here tonight
To take me up to my front walk and into the bed
Where it kisses my face
And eats my head

What should I do I’m just a little baby
What if the lights go out
And maybe and then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
So goodnight moon
I want the sun

I might be done
No it won’t be too soon ’til I say goodnight moon",Goodnight Moon,2012

And the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world in a
Show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it
All change don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or
or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Tea, girls, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha

And thank God I'm only watching the game controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage
parlours

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me",One Night in Bangkok,

Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of god
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

Among those dark satanic mills?

Bring me my arrows of desire
Bring me my spear, o clouds unfold
Bring me my chariots of fire

Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand

See one little reindeer fly through the snow

And the spirit be with you wherever you go

I remember the children who came to the door
And sang out the carols we all used to know

Tip-toeing softly trying not to awake
The ones who lie waiting for good things you know
Thank goodness this season will never grow old

Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

An' you come runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, cranky you can get a man
But now you're gone, and now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry or cry in vain
But now she's gone, now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Went to the station, down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train, worked and got to home
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me oh say goodbye
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Guardo meglio e non c' Ã¨
PiÃ¹ dubbio che tu sia, che sei 
La vita mia...
Che begli occhi vedrei 
Con gli occhi miei 
Quanto amore calturato con le mani 
Che ha le ali e con le ali svanirÃ  
Ed io mÃ¬ innamorai
Venni, a dirio a te, ti contidai 
Che eri tu o era mai
C' Ã¨ un temporale
Possiamo uscire e raffreddarci insieme ormai, tremare 
PerchÃ¨ tremare fÃ  
La vita che se ne va
Con te che porti via 
Con te 
La vita mia

PerchÃ¨ tremare fÃ  
La vita che se ne va
Con te che porti via

non del sangue ma del rosso,
acqua e sale e non le lacrime assaggiai,

arsure come di battaglia,
di comparse fuoco e paglia,
ed i cuori son cavalli scossi in noi.

Amarsi Ã¨ come andare in fuga.
Ã? cosa ho fatto, cosa ho detto mai...

Non Ã¨ la veritÃ  che piÃ¹ la dice e piÃ¹ la dice mai.
Ã? l'illusione mia che Ã¨ vera

e che scorre fiera tra le dita della vita.
Passa il suono e belle immagini di noi,

meraviogliosa confusione
tra i dialoghi e le pose,
e ogni peso appassionato
Ã¨ un soffio ma non la veritÃ ,
che Ã¨ sempre un'altra storia ma non lei,
lei che tra i baci miei d'amore.

Ã? improvvisazione,
non Ã¨ vento e non Ã¨ sole,
pioggia atroce meglio Ã¨ che non ci sia.

Amarsi Ã¨ come arrampicarsi
su uno schermo di illusione
e poi credere quell'edera realtÃ .

Ã? le bugie, ragazza mia,
il naso lungo e il gusto dell'addio.

Non Ã¨ la veritÃ  che piÃ¹ la dici mai.
Ã? vita che non sai,
sarÃ  che come me tu rivivrai
quando l'amore mio ti canterÃ².

Ã? quando tutti i giuramenti
fatti a te saranno inganni
alla vita che, stupita, sbanderÃ .

Amarsi Ã¨ prima di capire,
Ã¨ rimbambire la ragione in noi,

Non Ã¨ veritÃ ,
che piÃ¹ la dici e meno baci avrai.
E l'illusione mia che Ã¨ vera.

E chi ama canta
tra le voci della vita
l'acqua che si incontra col suo scialacquÃ¬o.

Oppure Ã¨ meglio non cantare,
muti se non Ã¨ d'amore
e qualcuno deve farlo e sono io che ti canterÃ²
e come in fuga nel tuo cuore andrÃ².

J'ai plus la cote que mon oseille
Mieux qu'un jean slim
Je fais mouler ton cœur si tu m'essaye
Celles qui l'ont fait l'ont pas l'air d'avoir digéré
Faut gérer, quand l'amour prend trop de poids, on fini par se déchirer
à trop se désirer, on prend plus le temps de se plaire
la canicule laisse toujours présagé des éclairs
on zappe le meilleur pour dire le pire
les mots dépasse les pensés, plus on y croit, plus sa empire

J'aborde ce thème en connaissance de cause
Mon expérience de vie démontre que l'amour n'est pas si rose
Hysteric love fout le mal de vivre
Ce n'est que l'effet de la société dans laquelle nous sommes contraint de vivre
Des larmes se délivrent, ivre, ton cœur ouvert comme un livre
J'ai pu lire entre les griffures ce qu'il t'arrive
Ne me dis pas que tu vas à la dèche sur le coup de la rage
Les yeux tristes, la routine te conduira chez le fleuriste
Quand l'Hysteric Love craque
De violentes disputes éclatent
Des portables qui se cassent
Une mauvaise insulte, une claque
Une porte qui claque
Au milieu de la nuit
Si tu ressens sa douleur
Va la chercher sous la pluie
Si tes jugements et ses regrets la torture
Dis lui, que c'est comme de l'or enfoui dans des ordures
Je te rassure, t'es pas le seul a vivre ça
Bien sur qu'on mérite mieux mais quand le cœur est brisé comme ça

Hysteric love se retrouve au tribunal.
Passionnel est le crime, les ruptures font trop mal
La bande original, des lovers en série.
Est-ce que plus belle est la vie de Bertand sans Marie
Hysteric love est trop louche, se reconcilie au lit
Repars au clash après la douche, comme une maladie
Et à l'usure provoque l'infidélité
Un moyen de bifurquer quand on à peine à se quitter
Hysteric love veut s'écarter, trop de fierté.

Amel Bent,"Je n'ai qu'une philosophie
Être acceptée comme je suis
Malgré tout ce qu'on me dit
Je reste le poing levé
Pour le meilleur comme le pire
Je suis métisse mais pas martyre
J'avance le cœur léger
Mais toujours le poing levé

Lever la tête, bomber le torse
Sans cesse redoubler d'efforts

Je suis l'as qui bat le roi

Encore plus haut, encore plus loin

Des sacrifices
S'il le faut j'en ferai

Bien plus d'amour que de misère
Bien plus de cœur que de pierre

J'voudrais goûter à leurs sourires
Ils me manquent, j'voudrais déguster leurs fou rires
J'voudrait par une journée ensoleillée
Contempler notre amitié, vivre et crier
Jusqu'à étouffer nos rinceurs
Qu'on soit unis en harmonie comme un seul coeur
Qu'on partage les succès et les efforts
Et si on souffre qu'on souffre comme un seul corps

J'la voudrais que sa douceur étouffe ma colère 
Qu'elle rayonne même quand y a de l'orage dans l'air

Quand j'observe la souffrance des désœuvrés 
Comment conserver l'espoir face aux coups notés de notre histoire 

N'a-t-on pas tous les mêmes rêves? 
Nos cœurs abritent les mêmes espoirs 
J'dis qu'on a tous les mêmes rêves 
nos âmes subissent le même désespoir

À devenir des cibles choutés au gom col.
C’est pas l’homme qui prend la vie,
C’est la vie qui prend l’homme,
Plus jeune on ma appris a prendre ce qu’elle me donne,
Alors j’ai pris ce qu’elle m’as donné mais ce n’était pas assez,
Il ne suffi pas de manger pour être rassasié,
Moi j’ai faim de sentiments j’ai soif de compliments
Y a trop de vivre pour les gens, on ce tue pour l’argent
Même si on a pas eu lés mêmes chances, on a tous besoin de reconnaissance.

J’ai besoin qu’on m’entende qu’on me regarde, qu’on ait confiance en moi
Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, croyez-en moi!

Les perles de réussites sont dans la musique et le sport
Car à l’école ils nous insistent a vite changer de bord,
Nos parcourt sont chaotiques car beaucoup de lacunes nous font viser le SMIC
Mais nous on veut viser la lune, a part nos parents qui nous aiment,
Ils nous prennent tous pour des guignols,
Ils s’étonnent qu’on ait la haine mais nous on veut juste changer la donne.
Un arabe riche est un riche, un arabe pauvre est un arabe,
Soit l’argent nous valorise soit c’est le point sur la table

Des bonnes go, percer, être riche et danser mais la vide est corsée! 
On s'entretue pour la richesse et on se perd dans la tristesse,

Et encore moins de fraternité

""La Fouine, 3endek tu veux une bombe faut le porte feuille qui va avec""
Alors il me fallait plus de fraîche que la veille (car sur la table)
Il faut la 'teille comme j’ai pas de paye protège ton dos car le crime paye
J’arnaque les criquets je pars au charbon
J’oublie tout pour son sourire, même les keufs postichés sous le balcon
Je suis tombé pour elle plus de maison plus de tour Eiffel plus de billets verts
Elle a le regard qui tue, le regard revolver
Mon frère comprend qu’avec une meuf comme ça à ton bras
Tu peux pas lui dire ""Ma belle ce soir je t’invite au kefta""

C’était ma meilleure, ma number one, ma best of the best vient pas test
Je m’allongeais sur le dos elle faisait le reste

Versé des acomptes aux grossistes et parlé D-Kiss

Va t'en que de crier je t’aime comme Lara Fabian
A toutes les Fatima, les Fatou, mères qui blindent nos parloirs
Pardonne moi de douter mais trop de gratteuses blindent mon répertoire
Et dans mes petits yeux marrons tu peux lire ce que je ressens pour toi
Ne me force pas à dire ce mot j’ai trop d’orgueil pour ça
Rappel toi quand on été pauvre et heureux,
Qu’on galérait à l’arrêt de bus
Qu’on se contentait de rien, d’un maxi best of plus

De celle-ci et cela sans se la péter en plus

And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger

Hangin' tough, stayin' angry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For we kill with the skill to survive

Amel Bent,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Corleone n'est pas un film, à la fin j'vais vous laisser
Mais tout comme eux je n'avais rien, je suis parti pour tout baiser
Des vols, des effractions, des flingues et des tractions
Je n'suis rentré dans le cœur de la vie que par pénétration
Déflagration, l'enfer de la nation
Je suis noir de relation et ces musiques sont les déboires de nos passions

I woke up and it was pouring down rain
I put my head on, it really wasn't no thing
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain
Threw on, Alice Coltrane, smoked and sang

And wrote this flame compused to the rhythm of the droplets
And went whispering simliar to gossip
The kick slapping at the window glass
Slow down the globe so it don't spin too fast

Because, I been running like a river since
The age of my early innocence
It just made me ambitious
My grams used to tell me ""Man listen,

If you can't burn, don't step into the kitchen""
You muscle your turn, the laws of the land viscious
We gotta stick to the plan, which is
Pursuing true riches, whether we trade stock or wash dishes

Throughout setbacks and few glitches

Or helpless, we not selfish so we wrote this

Yo from the parquet floors to the fifty foot ceiling
I pull the heavy black curtain back, now revealing
The sun beneath the velvet, and like it was mine

No one elses, embracing the beams yo, I felt it
And stood there, feeling it, getting charged
Turn me loose upon the streets, a young poet at large
Out in the world, up against tremendous odds

Some'll let it break em and throw in they cards
But my squad remain focus when we goin for ours
And we don't, do it for chains or do it for cars
And we don't, do it for lames or do it for broads

And we don't, do it for fame, we do it because
It's for the young black gifted mind
Living the story of the most twisted kind
Turbulent times swirled around they dome like a turban

It gets disturbing, feelin alone in the urban
But maintain ya grip for just a little bit

And a twisted tradition has a girl in a strangle hold
Lies a desert with the footprints
Of little girls with a secret
Of a pain
That you and I could never know

Little feet running fast as they can like a bird in flight
Through days of sand with a fire in the sky
And through indigo nights
She runs away from a life spent
Being witness to other unwilling participants
Of a pain
That you and I will never know

You're a bravebird
Of the rarest kind
You may be one of the walking wounded
But still you fly

Your a bravebird
You put yourself on the line
When you shared your secret with the world
You saved another mothers child

As she speaks you can tell that
The words are not easy to say
The hold the power to transport her back to that impossible day
But she hasn't any regrets
'cause' she won't become a woman with a secret
Of a pain
That you and I could never know

Am I happier alone?

As if something has gone
And split the foundation
Of shadow, of song

And raddled the windows,
And the tiny regrets
And the tiny glasses houses
That I tried to forget

Drink til your sleeping,
I love you that way
Like we are all babies;
All our beds are unmade
No memory has molded
Enough to forget
And our tiny glass houses
Are not built for us yet

Takes all of the courage,
And none of the pride,
To stand in the threshold-
To sit down inside
Where we are not babies;
No we are not new
And our tiny glass houses
With the beautiful view

There's a crack in my memory
Where a funeral parade,
Rolls through the doorway
That my memory made
And funeral marches
To its funeral sounds
And the tiny glass houses
Are all tumbling down

We'll come together on the renegade road
Lead you back to the wreckage of change
Build your bridges, learn your name

Cross the river in three good strides
Left the company wild with pride
River ribbon all around your legs
Gripped the surface and you turned your head

Jump the line and turn the key
Lose your guard, believe in me
I can love you best of all
I am the wrecking ball.

Hallelujah changed your tune
The sky was open for you all too soon
Left the cradle in the rockin' wind
Ran from nothing like it's everything

Night can turn the mirror on
Saw your face and it looked all wrong
Where are the eyes that you looked out from?
Two young coins in the rising sun

So you curb and then the tragedy
You put your faith in a reverie
All good soldiers stand for thee
Losing battles in front row seats

As your shoulders curl and bend with time
Then love and hatred must combine
You turn the page to reconcile
You see, I've loved you all the while",Wrecking Ball,2009

En tu corazón

Te vi pasar tangueando, altanera
Con un compás tan hondo y sensual
Que no fue más que verte y perder
La fe, el coraje, el ansia'e guapear
No me has dejado ni el pucho en la oreja
De aquel pasao malevo y feroz
Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

Ayer, de miedo a matar
En vez de pelear
Me puse a correr
Me vi en la sombra o finao
Pensé en no verte y temblé
Si yo, que nunca aflojé
De noche angustiao
Me encierro a llorar
¡Decí por Dios qué me has da'o
Que estoy tan cambiao
¡No sé más quién soy!",Malevaje,2006
Amelita Baltar,"Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a gota 
De orvalho numa pétala de flor 
Brilha tranquila 
Depois de leve oscila 
E cai como uma lágrima de amor 
A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar 
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim",A  Felicidade,2015

Amely Kantrasia,"I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm - he came around like
He was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know - don't seem to care
What your heart is for
No I don't know him anymore

There's nothin' where we used to lie
Conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine

I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am chained
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed 
Into something real
I'm cold and I am shamed and bound
And broken on the floor 
And I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care
I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what is goin' on
Nothin's right

I'm torn

It's only destiny
Or is it mystery
But then we came around and sang our song and acted proud
And posed for memory

We made a cry to the underground
Are you there
I looked and saw that they were still around
But do you care

I drank a little bit, so underlit to see it now
The show was never seen
And all the time I lost is never lost
It's only thumbing through eternity

We made a cry to the underground
Are you there
I looked and saw that they were still around
But do you care

Who are you going to see
What are you going to be

You made a cry to the underground
Are you there
I looked and saw that they were still around
But do you care

Are you there (are you there)
Are you there (are you there)
Are you there (are you there)
Are you there (are you there)
Are you there (are you there)
Are you there (are you there) ...",Are You There,1977
America,"Starlight falling through your hair 
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there 
Awake in the morning a smile on your face 
The same old feeling that I just can't place 

And you say don't cry, baby 
You know I'll always be the one who cares 
Don't cry, baby 
Come closer let me wipe away your tears 

A man came in with a violin 
He played for me like I've never been 
Courted before and forevermore 
As the bow touched the strings 
He made the whole world sing 

Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry) 
You know there'll always be someone who cares 
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry) 
Come closer let me wipe away your tears 

I know I've been wrong 
You've had to be strong 
I guess I belong to you, my baby (Baby, don't you cry) 
You know I'll always be the one who cares 
Don't cry baby (Baby, don't you cry) 
Come closer let me wipe away your tears 

The sound of your voice singing songs in the night 
Have taken me far away and mystified 
The songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes 
The words that you'd spoken made me realize 

",Don't Cry Baby,1977
America,"The waves come in 
Crash on the shoreline 
Salty water, don't you know 
It's yours, yours and mine 
So grab your girl 
And don't go wastin' time 
And let's go down to the water tonight 

White capped clouds 
Dance in the sunlight 
Purple fishes watch 
And show you some of their delight 
The weather's fine 
And everything's all right 
So let's go down to the water tonight 
Let's go down to the water tonight 

Come on down, come on down 
Come on down, down to the water 
Come on down, come on down 
Come on down, down to the water 
Down to the water 

Island music 
Sways with a palm tree 
Friends of mine lay back 
And talk of times that weren't so free 
So let's have fun 
And that means you and me 
And let's go down to the water tonight 
Let's go down to the water tonight

Down, down, down to the water 
Down, down, down to the water 
Down, down, down to the water 
Down, down, down to the water 
Down, down, down to the water

America,"God of the sun 
Don't make me wait till the morning comes 
Light in the sky 
Look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye 

Don't, keep me waiting around 
Too much longer now 
Don't, don't keep me waiting around, around, around, around 

When I called you from my river of darkness 
An echo was all that came back 
Saw you wave goodbye 
Down the railroad track 
Sometimes when you're out and all alone 
And you can't find your way back 
Wonder if you'll ever make it home 

God of the sun 
I'll be around till the day's begun 
One sight of your ray 
Takes the night away, away, away, away 

Oh, but when I walk through that door 
Take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call 
I tell you not right now, lady, I got work on my mind 
And I'll talk to you soon 
Always remember 

When I called you from my river of darkness 
An echo was all that came back 
I saw you wave goodbye 
Down the railroad track 
Sometimes when you're out and all alone 
And you can't find your way back 
Wonder if we'll ever make it home

America,"Sailin' down the coast of Mexico 
With a person I loved since long ago 
Into a place nobody wants to go 

Into a hurricane 
Whoa, hurricane 
Some'll be taken 
Some'll remain 

Heard people screamin' and the sky was torn 
I looked around and the faces were so forlorn 
No relief, only scorn 

In a hurricane 
In a hurricane 
Some'll be taken 
Some'll remain 

Hurricane's just another name 
For the torment in a man's soul 
His mind is gone 
And he starts to lose control 

In a hurricane 
Oh, the hurricane 
Some'll be taken 
Some'll remain 

How long will the wind blow? 
How long will the wind blow? 
Everybody talks; nobody really knows 
How long will the wind blow? 
How long will the wind blow? 
Shoo-ba-ree-ba, shoo-ba-ree-ba 
Nobody knows

America,"The monster exposed himself from underground 
Burning his face as he ran through the town 
Hoping the patrons just don't hear a sound 

Heart, court and harmony just ain't the same 
My black and their green playing some games 
I've got all these pictures I just need the frames 

These are the things that you'll never do 
Feeding the wife on the phone 
And there you are, all on your own 

Red and blue, I want to like a hole in the head 
It slopes in the middle and is stopping them dead 
I'd like to help them; I've already said 

These are the things that you'll never do 
Running away from your home 
And there you are, all on your own 
Mm, mm. Mm, mm.

America,"Please believe in me 
Though my love is hard to see 
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
I'll remain (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
But these tears (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
I can't contain (She's gone, she's gone) 

So can I count on you to be my light to guide me 
Right through the night beside me 
Is it all right to count on you 

Smile away these blues 
I don't care if I'm accused 
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
I don't mind (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
But, I got a feelin' (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone) 
It's all designed (She's gone, she's gone) 

To make me call on you to be my light to guide me 
Right through the night beside me 
Is it all right to call on you

America,"Someone told me you got to be free 
Someone told me to stand in the rear 
Keep on searchin' for kings in the street 
Keep on cryin' for something that's clear 
You are one more posse to pass in the night 
One more con to conceal 
One more tiger to paint on a stripe 
One more player to deal 
Political poachers push plump packages 
Past pacified places 
Concerned citizens cry crude conduct 
'Cause Captain Command 
Don't do dreams 
Do dreary drivel drive 
Doctor, daddy divine 
Prize shipment tonight, tomorrow tame tempers 
To touch tender time 
You are one more posse to pass in the night 
One more con to conceal 
One more tiger to paint on a stripe 
One more player to deal 
You are one more posse to pass in the night 
One more con to conceal 
One more tiger to paint on a stripe 
One more player to deal 
It takes one more moment of time in your life 
One more light to reveal 
One more place in the sun to turn ripe 
One more kingdom to feel 
You are one more posse to pass in the night 
One more con to conceal 
One more tiger to paint on a stripe
