Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Little bitty pretty one
Come on and talk-a to me
A-lovey dovey dovey one
Come sit down on my knee

Tell you a story
Happened long time ago
A-little bitty pretty one
I've been watchin you grow",Little Bitty Pretty One,1995
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Well, buzz, buzz, buzz goes the bumble bee
Tweele, deedle, dee goes the bird
But the sound of your little voice, darling
Is the sweetest sound I've ever heard

I've seen the beauty of the red, red rose
Seen the beauty when the sky is blue
Seen the beauty of the evening sunset
But the beauty of you
Sweet as the honey from the honeycomb
Sweet are the grapes from the vine
But there's nothing as sweet as you, darling
And I hope someday you'll be mine

Well, buzz, buzz, buzz goes the bumble bee
Tweele, deedle, dee goes the bird

Seen the beauty when the sky is blue

And I hope someday you'll be mine
Hope someday you'll be mine
Hope someday you'll be mine
Hope someday you'll be mine

Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
oh what a shock ""you're on the wrong block""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
",Silhouettes,1997
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know What heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his
face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out. while you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the
telephone.
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.
Won't you change partners and then,
You may never want to change partners again.",Change Partners,1997
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Well buzz buzz buzz goes the bumble bee
A twiddledeedledee goes a bird
But the sound of your little voice, darling,
Its the sweetest sound Ive ever heard.
Well, Ive seen the beauty of the red, red rose,
Seen the beauty when the skies are blue,
Seen the beauty of the evening sunset- but the beauty of you!
Sweet is the honey from the honeycomb,
Sweet are the grapes of a vine,
But theres nothing as sweet as you, darling,
And I hope some day youll be mine!",Diana,1997
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"
Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps,
Why did ya say goodbye to me
And now I'm lonely as could be?
And as I feel a teardrop fall,
I hear your footsteps down the hall
 
Walkin' away from me.
Why did ya say goodbye?
Why did ya make me cry?
Now ev'ry day I wonder 
Why, why, a-why, why, why, why?
 
You're such a haunting memory,
I pray that you'll come back to me?
But as I say my evening pray'rs,
I hear your footsteps on the stairs,
 
Walkin' away from me.
Why did ya say goodbye?
Why did ya make me cry?
Now ev'ry day I wonder 
Why, why, a-why, why, why, why?
Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps.

Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes

Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears

Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.

Lets rock, everybody, lets rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

Frankie Miller,"I'll tell you a story about a night in the town
It started off drinking and fighting.
By the time a was through, 
I'd near worn out my shoes, 

I had visited every known dive.
All the lights in the alley, 
Fall dim on the ground, When your trying to see your
Way home.
And the all night ladies, 
In their perfume so fine, 
Wont leave a poor boy alone.

Well the paths of the gambler
Are kneeded too thin, 
When the cards are all spread on the floor.
The six and the seven, 
I needed to win, 

And you can't call the bluff any more.
So you stand to your feet, 
And you figure discretely, 
The best way to pay what you owe.
And she hands you a line, 
Tells you thanks for the time, 

'You might have brought brains to the show.'

Chorus:
Drunken nights on the city, 
Are showing their toes, 
They'll take you for all that you owe.
You can't judge a book, 
And you can't judge a crook, 
Down where the men, they can't go.
 
By early the next morning, 
I rose up to tight, 
My eyes were as red as the light.
My pockets were empty, 
And so was my heart, 
And I promised to put things right.
So I went to the preacher, 
I fell on my knees, 
I asked the preacher, 

To right all my wrongs, 
But he just shook his head, 

And looked sorry when he said, 

'You've been on the drink far too long'",Drunken Nights in the City,1975

Are kneeded too thin, 
When the cards are all spread on the floor.
The six and the seven, 
I needed to win, 

And you can't call the bluff any more.
So you stand to your feet, 
And you figure discretely, 
The best way to pay what you owe.
And she hands you a line, 
Tells you thanks for the time, 

'You might have brought brains to the show.'

Chorus:
Drunken nights on the city, 
Are showing their toes, 
They'll take you for all that you owe.
You can't judge a book, 
And you can't judge a crook, 
Down where the men, they can't go.
 
By early the next morning, 
I rose up to tight, 
My eyes were as red as the light.
My pockets were empty, 
And so was my heart, 
And I promised to put things right.
So I went to the preacher, 
I fell on my knees, 
I asked the preacher, 

To right all my wrongs, 
But he just shook his head, 

And looked sorry when he said, 

'You've been on the drink far too long'",Drunken Nights in the City,2014

Por eso te deseo alguien mejor a tu lado 
Que te aguante lo que yo no te he aguantado
Y que no le importe de lo lindo bueno y sano 
Para amarte sentirte y quererte tu mereces 
Ese hombre diferente que te acepte tus caprichos
Libremente que sea ciego, sordomudo impotente
Y que no crea en la moral d la gente y que no
Sirva para hacerte el amor el amor

Échame a mi la culpa de todo 
Sobreviviré no me rendiré lo haré a mi modo
Échame a mi la culpa de todo 
Solamente una vez te entrego el alma te brindo todo

Te pasas hablando de mi no pensé que fueras así

Échame la culpa a mi,quiero seguir siendo culpable
Yo que te quería y tu me traicionaste
Échame la culpa a mi quiero seguir siendo culpable

Frankie Negron,"Es como una maldición este tiempo sin tu amor, como te extraño
Y como sangra la herida y se me acaba la vida, ya no lo aguanto
Como agua de cristal, así es el amor que yo llevo por dentro
Y me consumo cuando te sueño, las mañanas junto a ti son como el cielo inmenso

Este amor es como mar, algo que se va a escapar, no cabe en mi pecho
Para mantenerme vivo necesito ese motivo que en ti yo encuentro
Cuando ya no pueda mas, voy a salir a volar, voy a buscarte
Y cuando tenga tu amor sincero volverá la luz de nuevo a mi universo

Tu amor es como un río que baña el cuerpo,
Es como un remolino que va creciendo
Tu amor es el perfume que trajo el viento
Si te vas a marchar, llévate antes mi cuerpo

Sin condiciones, ni lamentos why tropiezos
Si, volver a internar, why revivir mi sueño
A su fuego why sentimiento, a su amor

Tu olvidaras why encontraras algo bueno
Tu lo entenderas, se nos acabo el tiempo
No quiero verte mas llorar
Dejemos de sufrir why actuar
No vale la pena lastimar

Lo que el tiempo quiere recordar
No quiero verte mas llorar
Tus lagrimas sofocaran
El intento de mi libertad

La oportunidad de empezar
Que no sea esto un cruel final
Se que nos dolera
Why tambien que se ira, deprisa

El triste adios junto al frio why mal recuerdo
Why quedaras en paz, why solo habra un momento
Que tendrias en ti muy dentro, tu why yo

Tú sabes bien que es lo que yo siento
Sólo sé que eso es mentira,
Dime porqué desconfías
Sólo sé que eso es mentira,
Bórrate los malos pensamientos
Sólo sé que eso es mentira,
Lo que dicen es por envidia
Sólo sé que eso es mentira

Te marcharías sin mi

Frankie Negron,"La amistad es algo
Que atraviesa el alma
Es un sentimiento
Que no se te va

No te digo como,
Pero ocurre justo
Cuando dos personas
Van volando juntos

Suben a lo alto
Sobre la otra gente
Como dando un salto
En la inmensidad

Y no habrá distancia (no habrá)
Ni desconfianza
Si te quedas en mi corazón
Ya siempre

Porque en cada sitio que estés
Porque en cada sitio que esté
En las cosas que vives yo también viviré

Porque en cada sitio que estés
Nos encontraremos unidos
Uno en brazos del otro
Es el destino

En la misma calle
Bajo el mismo cielo
Y aunque todo cambie
No nos perderemos

Abre bien los brazos
Mándame un aviso
No te quepa duda
Yo te encontraré

No estarás ya sola (yo estaré)
Continuando el vuelo que
Te lleve con mi corazón
Ya siempre

Porque en cada sitio que estés
No nos queda más que un camino
Solo habrá dos amigos tan unidos

It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living
Well they won't last for all of us
But they'll last for a long summer night
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies

Be my special one

I like the way you walk
I love the way you run

Banana colored light skinned spics 
You feel your peel so fine
I'm Hernandez, the umbrella man
Your future's locked in mine
The chaplains, and the golden guineas
The red wings and the crowns
The mighty mau maus, those shines from Brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down, down
The savage skulls, the Fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

I think we got something to talk about

Or you can buy some protection from me.

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

And though you are gone

Frankie Randall,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1996
Frankie Randall,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Dejó la soledad aquí en mi almohada 
Después que te ofrecí todas mis noches 
Dejé que te marcharas sin reproches

No quisé detenerte con mi llanto 
Mi orgullo de varón logró evitarlo 
Y solo me quedó el sabor amargo 
De tu espacio vacío entre mis brazos

Si no te hubieras ido 
No existiría un recuerdo 
En busca de un olvido

Si no te hubieras ido
Si no te hubieras ido

Y el nombre de ella

Ya rodé por mi país entero

Tuve lluvia y cerrazón

Cuando llueve el limpiador desliza 
Va y viene el parabrisas late igual mi corazón. 
Loco por lo dulce de sus besos 
Miro lleno de deseos 
Su retrato en el panel

Es en el calor de su abrazo 
Que me olvido del cansancio 
Y me abastezco de su miel

Me rendiste a tu placer y esa es tu forma de ser
Hasta me hiciste olvidar, olvidar que soy casado

En un sitio cualquiera
Ya comenzaba la orquesta

Entre mil falsos colores
La ultima estrella
La colección de mis sueños
Mirandome así

Con esos ojos intrusos
Buscaste los míos
Para arrancarles el alma
Y volcarlos en ti
Para que yo como un zombi
Llegara a tu lado
Y te sacara a la pista
Dispuesto a vivir

Bailando, hicimos el amor

Dejamos de ser dos, bailando
El ritmo nos unió, bailando
Perdimos en control, bailando
Bailando, hicimos el amor

Este romance en el baile
Encontró su principio
Y por el baile jamas
Va a tener un final
Pues cada vez que mis brazos
Te aprietan bailando
Vamos marcando tu y yo

Que en mis noches tristes desiertas de sueño
De loco deseo, me siento su dueño

Porque ha sido mí sin haberla amado
Que es su alma fría la que me atormenta
Que ve que me muero y no se da ni cuenta

Conmigo té mesías en el aire
Volabas en caballo blanco en mundo
Why esas cosas no podrán volver

why es que lo dudo
Porque hasta a veces me has llorado por un beso
Llorando de alegría why no de miedo
Why lo dudo té que te pase igual con él, igual con él

Anda why ve, entregale
Todo el amor que un día mío fue
Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado
Pero no pienses en mi es un punto ya pasado why olvidado

Yo no te prometi nada que no pudiera cumplir
Te ensene lo que es carino te ensene lo que es vivir pero hasta ahi
Me has llorado por un beso suplicando mis caricias
Asi yo te espero ver parada en la misma esquina mi china

Ella tiene que saber que es ella.
Si más la miro la encuentro más bella,
y no voy a descansar
hasta casarme con ella.

Coro:
Tiene que saber que es ella, que es ella.

La que busco para que me ame y me mime
y me domine a su manera.

Su mirada me ha cautivado y enamorado
es que enloquece a cualquiera.

Si la miro la encuentro mas bella
ella tiene que saber que es ella.

La mas linda y la mas bella
ella tiene que ser la primera.
~
Quiero hacerla feliz junto a mi
porque yo vivo y muero con ella.

Cada dia la veo mas bella
la comparo que el furor de una estrella.

Y no voy a descansar por su amor
voy a luchar quiero casarme con ella

Frankie Ruiz,"Mira que ironica es la vida
Aun me deseas con la misma intensidad
Conque rodabamos amandonos el la yerba
Cuando yo apenas comensaba la universidad

Tu me desias no se como pero pronto e de lograr
En el dinero viajes, lujos why un carro para pasiar
Why te encontrastes la oculensia

En ese hombre que te da
Porque deseas mas no llena
Lo que yo si se llenar

En ese que te brinda estabilidad economica
Why siempre te complase en tus caprichos materiales
Why yo que e saboriado cada pliege de tu intimidad

Soy eterno fuego tu fantasia
Soy el que motiva tus escapes cada dia
Esto es un peligro pero es divino
Es que en el peligro esta el sabor de lo proibido
Este amor que cresio por la necesidad
Que sasiar lo que el dinero no puede llenar

Mira que ironica es la vida
Hoy nueva mente juntos aqui en el mismo motel
Donde rompimos beso a beso la innocensia
Cuando la cama se empapo de tu nines

Tus ambisiones vinos finos why restaurantes
Mis illusiones subir alto why alcanzar lo que sone
Es ebidente as progresado ahora ueles a carter
Mas tu riquesa no a llenado el vacio que deje

Soy eterno fuego tu fantasia
Soy el que motiva tus escapes cada dia
Esto es un peligro pero es divino
Es que en el peligro esta el sabor de lo proibido
Este amor que cresio por la necesidad
Que sasiar lo que el dinero no puede llenar

Oye mamita te fuistes con ese que tiene dinero
Mas sin embargo el papito rico ese soy yo
Esto es un peligro pero es divino

Soy eterno fuego tu fantasia
Soy el que motiva tus escapes cada dia
Esto es un peligro pero es divino
Es que en el peligro esta el sabor de lo proibido
Este amor que cresio por la necesidad
Que sasiar lo que el dinero no puede llenar

Sin movimientos y medio loco
Mientras camines de esa manera

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

'Neath the waves

And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

I can remember loving caresses showered on me.
Mother's eyes would gaze at me so tender,
What was their meaning? Now I can see.

One bright and guiding light,
That taught me wrong from right,
I found in my mother's eyes.
Those baby tales she told,
That road all paved in gold,
I found in my mother's eyes.

Just like a wandering sparrow,
One lonely soul.
I walked the straight and narrow,
To reach my goal.
God's gift sent from above,
A real unselfish love,
I found in my mother's eyes.

When I'm all alone, no one around me,
I find the future dark as can be.
Sorrows I have known, always surround me,
Then through the shadows, I always see.

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be
Walking home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name
Funny, I seem to find that, no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss
And the love I left behind...

I found in my mother's eyes.

One lonely soul.
I walked the straight and narrow,
To reach my goal.

Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

Late December back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night
Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh what a night, hypnotizin' mesmerizing me
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under

Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me (baby, Ba-baby)

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair
Never will go so well
But why should I try to resist
When darlin' I know so well
I've got you under my skin

Sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ears

Don't you know (little fool, little fool)
You never can win (never win, never win)
Use your mentality(never win, never win, never win); wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

No song to sing

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June

You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.
Don't be blue anymore.",Blue Skirt Waltz,1996

Frankie Yankovic,"This is the strip polka
I adore this ?

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time",Strip Polka,2002
Frankie Yankovic,"You're my girl the boys all know, you're my girl, I've told them so.
You should have seen how their faces fell when they were wishing me well.
They called me a lucky guy, and I couldn't hide a feeling of pride.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine, my whole life through.
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
You're what I've waited for, and you're my girl.

The kids that see me come to call have written your name and my name on the wall.

It's common gossip everywhere, that you and I have got it bad for fair.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine my whole life through,
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,

My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey

And make you happy
If you will only
Stay the same

To love another
You'll regret it all someday

Franklin G. Buchanan,"When I was young in my prime
I left my home in Caroline
Now all I do is sit and pine
For all the folks I left behind
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right there to say
My grip is packed to travel
And I'm scratching gravel
For that blue ridge far away

I'm gonna stay right by my Ma
I'm gonna do right by my Pa
Lay around the cabin door
No work on worry anymore
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
What to see my old day tray
What to hunt the possum
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away

I see a window with the light
I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight
I'm got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Every day I'm counting
Still I climb that mountain
Oh, that blue ridge far away",Blue Ridge Mountain Blues,1991

Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Drifting too far from the shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
You're drifting to far from the shore

Yes I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
Till I leave my love behind

There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone

I can't escape this broken heart of mine
I've no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Till I reach that distant shore",Foggy River,1991

As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break

When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away

And he asked him gently, where do you belong

I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong

From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

The last admit I saw of her she was running out my door
She had 2 bags and a look in her eyes
That said that this would be the last time she'd say goodbye
But I wish there was a reward but she took it all (my love)

But every ones a vacant heart when will love move in
It's in the news that we all lose when love ain't moving in
I only have these empty rooms and there all filled with space
And I can't seem to find much love in this place
And the doors that close behind leave me standing cold outside
I'm just a vacant heart

I put her pictures in a box and now my walls are bare
The shadows that were once her things now seem to disappear
The boxes were once empty things until you filled them up
Now heart is just another box with no room at the top
Now I stand with that look in my eye that said that
I can't take one more goodbye

But every ones a vacant heart when will love move in
It's in the news that we all lose when love ain't moving in
I only have these empty rooms and there all filled with space
And I can't seem to find much love in this place
And the doors that close behind leave me standing cold outside
Now, love ain't moving in no without somethings the heart forgets
When memories bring her back instead

That you might just forget how to laugh

Did the world just miss its second meltdown?
And if it weren't for you
Would the stars all be trying to fall on our heads now?

And you know it's time
That you actually tried to put yourself first
Could it be, you don't see there are better things
Than stopping them being worse
And don't you know that it's OK
To take a rest some days

So many months ago
You said you will always worry
But you had to let me go, go

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm trying to change my past
Can you give me just one more minute?
How I've lost the time
But I always seem to put you in it

However hard it was sometimes
You seem to know the words and hum the lines
To songs that make your heart so sore
Maybe I should write one more

When you won't just bring me back one time
To hide so many truths
Then run from me and back to him
And leave me like this fool

[Chorus]

A fraud of love, that's all you were
For you are an emptiness
A person who seems to be void

Are three little words

And they ain't got any plans

For all I want from you
Is a kiss or two

Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Hohoh

Es gab einmal vor langer Zeit, Jahre bevor du geboren wurdest
Zwei Menschen, die sich liebten und sie waren bereit
Alles zu geben, sich ihr Leben zu teilen
Und sie schworen sie werdens schaffen und sind irgendwann frei
Sie hatten Träume zu verwirklichen
Zu viele Träume, die nicht wirklich sind
Weil seine Eltern deutsch und ihre türkisch sind
Doch es gab nichts, dass sie mehr fürchtete
Und nichts, dass für ihn härter wäre, als wenn das Feuer in ihrem Herz erlischt
Sie nahm die Knete aus der Jacke von ihrem Daddy
Keiner wusste, ob sie je wieder zurück kam, als sie wegging
Und als sie nicht mehr bei ihm war, war's hart und ihm ging's dreckig
Doch er ging ihr nach mit nur 'ner Hand voll Kleingeld in der Baggy
Sie ham geschworen sie gehn durch dick und dünn
Sie ham geschworen sie wären durch nichts zu trennen
Sie wären verloren, wenn sie sich nicht mehr kennen
Vielleicht war's Schicksal und es durfte nicht sein
Doch plötzlich war's als schien der Mond im dunkeln nur für die zwei
Keiner hätt's geglaubt, doch wenn man kämpft und es versucht
Wird der allergrößte Traum wahr und am Ende alles gut
Und die Zwei hofften so lang jetzt war endlich alles cool
Und sie wurd schwanger mit dem Baby und ihr Baby, das bist du

Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Auch, wenn wir uns nicht sehen bin ich ständig bei dir
Im Herz und ich bin da für dich, egal was passiert
Bis an den Tag, wo ich im Grab liegt und mein Atem gefriert
Komm schon. Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Du brauchst nicht weinen. Ich hab 'n Platz reserviert
Im Herz und, wenn du einsam bist hör hin, wie es schlägt
Und du wirst spüren, dass ich bei dir bin. Was auch immer geschieht

Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Hohoh

Es trifft dich und schmerzt, bricht mir mein Herz
Selbst, wenn wochenlang die Sonne scheint fühl ich mich wie im Herbst
Seit du nicht mehr bei mir bist ist nichts so, wie es war
Und so, wie es ist gibt's nichts, was ich noch ohne dich hab
Ich schwörs. Ich denk an dich und tätowier mir deinen Namen aufs Herz
Und denk dran. Ich bin weiterhin für dich da
Du hörst, wie Mami weint und schreit: ""Ruf uns wieder an!""
Und ich weiß nicht, ob dus mir je verzeihst, doch ich tu, was ich kann
Und es tut mir Leid, dass ich nicht täglich mit der Fußball spielen kann
Und es tut weh, wenn ich dich nicht mit Mom zur Schule bringen kann, Kleiner
Du kannst nix dafür, doch hast es gespürt
Wie aus Liebe plötzlich Hass wird und der Hass uns zerstört
Doch glaub mir alles, was ich sag ist echt, wenn ich dir was rhyme
Schreib ich, bis ich vorm Blatt einschlaf, mit Tränen, die ich wein
Doch es ändert nichts dran, nein. Dein Daddy kommt nicht heim
Doch, wenn du leise bist und hinhörst sagt dein Herz dir diese Zeilen

Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Auch, wenn wir uns nicht sehen bin ich ständig bei dir
Im Herz und ich bin da für dich, egal was passiert
Bis an den Tag, wo ich im Grab liegt und mein Atem gefriert

Und du wirst spüren, dass ich bei dir bin. Was auch immer geschieht

Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz

Dass seine Bitch gerade mit mir Party macht

Halt, ich bin eigentlich ja gegen Gewalt, verstehst du?
Doch red jetzt weiter und ich geh dir an Hals, verstehst du?

Fick mein Weib bis ich den Text versaue
Der Moment is gekommen, wo ich dir in die Fresse haue
Nix wie weg hier, diesmal schlag ich dir in die Fresse
Homie vertrau mir, guck ich versprech's dir
Dein Jochbein, dein Genick und dein Rückgrat, ich brech's dir

Nachdem der Pfarrer fragt, ob noch irgendwer was zu sagen hat
Die Gäste und das Brautpaar schauen verstört zu diesem alten Sack
Und er legt richtig los du bist ja nich normal, du Idiot!
Ähm, entschuldigung, wir heiraten hier gerade ?
Ich hab so Sachen jeden Tag
Denn er meint, Liebe hält nicht ewig und dass das Paar da 'n Fehler macht
Doch die zwei nehm sich in den Armen, küssen sich und sagen dann
Liebe lebenslang, wir glauben dran und dieser Mann sagt:

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben

I lit a cigarette
In a dive bar in downtown TJ
I ordered two shots
Dropped a dime in the jukebox
And played 3Life By The Drop2 by Stevie Ray

She was eighteen years old
Young and out of control
A Catholic school girl with ruby red lips
With that she pulled me close
Said Baby let's toast to meeting you in a place like this
Oh Bella Maria
Was raised in East L.A.
My Spanish rose from Mexico
Who stole my heart in TJ

The years have gone by
But from time to time
I still think of that night we shared
The last I heard she'd married divorced
Livin' not too far from here
Then one day in the Cuban café
I spotted those ruby red lips
She said I'll be your waitress today
What's the chances of me
Seeing you in a place like this

Oh Bella Maria
Was raised in East L.A.
My Spanish rose from Mexico
Who stole my heart in TJ

In a rundown church
Out on the edge of town
Maria was dressed in white
She had flowers in her hair
The congregation stared as an angel walked down the aisle
Right there in God's house we exchanged our vows
And sealed the deal with a kiss
With that I pulled her close
Said, who would have know 
We'd be meeting in a place like this

And a birth of a stillborn child
She was only 13 and her little body wasn't ready

Never let me miss carnival
With calypso songs philosophical

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

Franz Allers,"When she mentioned how her aunt
Bit off the spoon, she completely done me in
And my heart went on a journey to the moon
When she told about her father and the gin
And I never saw a more enchanting farce
Than the moment when she shouted, ""Move your bloomin'""

I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No it's just on the street where you live

And oh the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care
If I can be here on the street where you live

",On the Street Where You Live,
Franz Allers,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1964
Franz Allers,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

The climate must be perfect all the year

A law was made a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot
And there's a legal limit to the snow here in Camelot

And exits March the second on the dot
By order, summer lingers through September in Camelot

Camelot: Camelot
I know it sounds a bit bizarre
But in Camelot: Camelot

By eight, the morning fog must disappear
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot
For happily ever after in than here in Camelot

How humiliating! How delightful

Will I take her back or throw the baggage out

Take a position and staunchly never budge
A most forgiving man

But, I shall never take her back

Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze

But I'm so used to hear her say 
Good morning everyday
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows

Are second nature to me now

And so easy to forget

We pretend not to look at each other
But he could see over his shoulder
He got me a time,
He got that a time,
Never a time again

I noticed the hair on her head that's not real
Now I'm left with a dead and a naked ordeal
When all I want is down at the shore,
Sitting in my car

And bitter sometimes
But the taste is sweet
Your friends only like themselves in photographs
I don't like them,
I don't like you

We pretend not to care for another
I stand on my feet when I hold her
We pretend not to look at the change,
And for good I cry

So when the stars look bright above me,
And in the streetlights I can't see
I walk on down to make a stand,
Where he once stood

So now they lie there breast to breast and toe to toe
And all I want is down at the shore,
Sitting in my car

We end it, it's all over,
She'll marry me but I'll hold her
She shoveled the dirt into my face,
But I don't care

I love her",Ghost in a Ditch,2006

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Fraser MacPherson Quartet,"Samantha, you're all
I'll ever adore,
So forgive me, do,
If I say to you
What I've said so often before.

I love you, Samantha,
And my love will never die.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Together, Samantha,
We could ride a star and ride it high.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
And if some distant day
You decided to say,
""Get along, go away, goodbye!""
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one gal guy.",I Love You Samantha,1987
Fraser MacPherson Quartet,"Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish, I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you

And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you",Memories of You,1987
Fraser MacPherson Quartet,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Fraser MacPherson Trio,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Fraser Speirs,"Somethin's wrong cause my mind is fading,
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting,
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis
Stealing kisses from the leper's faces
Heads are hanging from the garbageman trees
Mouthwash, jukebox, gasoline,
Pistols are pointing at a poor man''s pockets
Smiling eyes with 'em out of the sockets

Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind

Discount orgies on the dropout buses
Hitchin' a ride with the bleedin' noses
Comin' to town with the briefcase blues

Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind

Everywhere I look there's a devil in waiting.

Fraser Speirs,"What kind of song would you give
If you had a song to give
What kind of life would you live
If you had a life to live
Would you wanna make something good, that you could look on
Give you lots of pleasure, yeah you would

What about this thing that you gave
What if it weren't quite perfect
What about if it was something bad about it
Would you love it just the same
Would you still care about it

Almost like somebody thought they would
Thought they would

Fraser Speirs,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden
I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Silver buttons all down her back
High, low, tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk te dog

Asked a fellow for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Never got back till the fourth of July
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk the dog",Walking the Dog,2004
