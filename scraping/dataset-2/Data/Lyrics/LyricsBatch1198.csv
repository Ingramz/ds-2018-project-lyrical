Tim O’Brien & Darrell Scott ,"A farmboy from Kentucky Hills
Learned to play guitar for his backpoarch thrills
Lean a ladderback chair on a windowsill
And look out at the stars
He must have got it up in Michigan
He and his brothers were pickin then
When he moved to Gary he took it with him
That Gibson Hummingbird guitar

Oh how that guitar would ring
Dad would close his eyes and sing
Silver Haired Daddy would always bring a tear to his eyes

I was all of five years old
My brother Don and a kid down the road
We just did what we was told to get outside and play
Someone wrapped it in a coat
And we took it to the swamp just to see if it'd float
But a Hummingbird is not a boat
And it sank straight away

When he got home that's when he heard
What we'd done to that Hummingbird
And he looked at me and never said a word
Just went out back to see

And there it was in all it's mess
With the cattails and the redwing nests
And there he laid it down to rest for all eternity

One of these days you know what I'll do
Get a Hummingbird guitar and a brother or two
Underneath a Kentucky moon, give him back his childhood dream
It won't make up for thirty-two years
And it won't dry up a swamp of tears
But it's better than a case of beer and a fifth of Jim Beam",The Hummingbird,2012

Tim O’Brien & Darrell Scott ,"This is the song that nobody knows
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry and laugh right out loud
It's the song I sing when there's no one around

This is the man that nobody sees
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
And if he learned how to fly he'd never touch down
It's the man I am when there's no one around

It's four in the morning, I'm lying in bed
With a tape of my failures playing inside my head
The hardknocks and heartaches, things I don't know
I listen and wonder, where will it go?

This is aglimpse of the child within
He's so immature but he's still my best friend
He's just one of the boys who gets lost in a crowd
It's the kid I am when there's no one around

This is the dance I do everyday
I let my soul lead and it takes me away
And it leads my steps to higher ground
It's the dance I do when there's no one around

Will the circle be unbroken

I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw that undertaker
For to carry my mother away

Well I told that undertaker
Undertaker please rive slow
For the lady you are hauling
Lord I hate to see that woman go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting
By and by lord by and by

Well I followed close behind them
I tried to stand up and be brave
But I could not hold back my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by lord by and by
Please tell me there's a better home awaiting
In the sky lord in the sky

I went back home but my home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
Lord what a home so sad and lonesome",When There's No One Around/Will the Circle Be Unbroken,2012
Tim O’Brien & Darrell Scott ,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2013

Tim Parker,"You used to like my style, I used to like your smile
I said I'll stay a sec, you said, stay a while
You started sippin' wine, said I was on your mind
I said I'm thinking of you too girl, your hella fine
We hit the night time, for a late date
And everyday after that, for 8 months straight
We would roll tight, we had small fights
You shoulda seen how we argued under street lights
I couldn't see your tears, from the pouring rain
You shoulda seen my body shake, when she said my name

She said I'm not the same, Andre ya changed
I said baby its pain, from the rap game
We went our separate ways, man I was hurt for days
Man I didn't even call, I went through withdrawal
Flashbacks of her face hit me sometime
And I be wonderin' man does she think of mine
I think of Rose

[Chorus: ]
Love is down through the hardest times
Sometimes I put Al Green on and think of Rose
Being with you is just a state of mind
Girl, thinking about you all the time

I saw her at a club, she was with a thug
She thought I would say hi, but I didn't show no love
The homey blazin' bud, and now its getting live
But I knew that she knew, that I'd protect my pride
I see her watchful eye, from across the joint
And then she knew how I feel, if I heard her voice
And some ladies talked, and other ladies walked
But when it came to you girl, man there was a spark
Your whole anatomy, man, was like poetry
The very smell of your hair was like luxury
It was because of me, when the days was bright
I would come through with my silent nights
Man, I think of Rose

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Rose,2000
Tim Patrick,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,2006
Tim Patrick,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2006

There's a time for love and a time for healing 
Can't go back and undo what's been done 
The word of mouth, time is revealing 
Just how far we've left this kingdom come 
Hand in hand we're finding our way 
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Kiss of life and the hand of fate 
Boy grows up into his father's son 
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate 
To carry on the way it had been done 
All our lives, it's debts to repay 
Maybe someday we can put the past away 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Put your fear away, find a better way 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Underneath a broken sky 
Love can heal the pain inside 
In a moment things can change 
One look behind and it's never the same",All Kinds of People,1991

Let me tell you about a man I knew 
Yeah, I knew him all too well 

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight 
But not for tomorrow 
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford 
More than you can borrow 
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I 
Pick their pockets hey 
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train 
And make my getaway 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 

I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes 
Did something strange to me 
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride 
But there was a fork in the street 
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules 
That I've been taught 
You never get involved, never drop your defences 
But this time I got caught 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes 
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine

Tim Ponzek,"She put on her rose-tinted glasses
And picked up her bag
Said, “Guess I’ll see you around”
Empty words with no commitment
From someone no longer tied down
I guess rose is the color you want to see
When you finally open your eyes
And blue
Blue is the color of goodbye

You remember her voice like a rainstorm
Falling all around you
But her words were lost in the mist
With all the things you’re trying to remember
Like the last time the two of you kissed
I guess gray is the color of fading echoes
All jumbled up in your mind
And blue
Blue is the color of goodbye

You pull the drapes across the window
And shut the door tight
Searching for a piece of the dark
Trying to create an empty space
So it looks like the place in your heart
I guess black is the color you paint your soul
As you disappear in the night
And blue
Blue is the color of goodbye
I guess blue
Blue is the color of goodbye",Blue Is the Color of Goodbye,2000
Tim Ponzek,"Sometimes I just can’t find any words that help me explain
The feeling I get when you set me up just to knock me down again
First you want things to be differentthen you want things the same
There’s a party going on in your mind but I’m too old for games
And if you ask me what I’m made of I’ll tell you to your face
Don’t ask me if I’m a man or a mouse when the rats are winning the race

‘Cause I’m burning a short fuse and it won’t last
And if you’re gonna snooze you’re gonna lose,it’s burning up fast
And when the heat is on and the bombs all explode
I’ll be long goneheaded down the road

Looks like you still can’t see anything from my point of view
We’ve been through it all and we talk things outbut what you say is not what you do
You drag me on to a see-saw, we’re up and then we’re down
And with our love we go to hell and back; and then we go to town
And if you ask me for the problem, I’ll tell you to your face
You’re driving me right out of my mind and that’s an awful thing to waste

‘Cause I’m burning a short fuse and it won’t last
And if you’re gonna snooze you’re gonna lose,it’s burning up fast
And when the heat is on and the bombs all explode
I’ll be long gone headed down the road

At times we get so closethen you get that look in your eyes
A light goes on, a better ideabut you better not even try
Everything’s gonna go crazy; it’s all wrong then it’s all right
And if you’re winding up for the big one, well you better not wind too tight
And if you ask me if I’m all right I’ll tell you to your face
I’m like an astronaut that’s on the launch pad and I’m headed into space

While the ghost of our love is beginning to take shape

Don’t leave like a thief in the night

If it’s overI need to know

Draw a stick across the sand and stay on our own side of the line

It’s only a question of when it’s gonna happen
Our love’s already burning like an eternal flame

So let’s just say I’m wrong
We could just ride this love like a hurricane ‘til the storm is gone

You can’t tell me you don’t see these sparks jumpin’
You can’t tell me that we’re not startin’ something
Startin’ something

We can act real meek
We can just scratch the surface so we don’t touch anything too deep
Or we can dig way down
Till we hit a geyser and all our love comes gushing out

Tim Ponzek,"He had a fragile ego for his rough and tumble build
Every inch the elegant caveman, his destiny fulfilled
When he made his grand entrance, every head turned in the room
And when he did his tribal dance, every girl was sure to swoon
But he kept his ego on a shelf with his other bric-a-brac
Not the safest place when he’s taking in a cat

And she had a cat, a spirit feline and pure
She could raise her fur or purr, soft and demure
She was used to being treated in all of the extremes
She was a little to worldly to be the woman of his dreams
She could dance around trouble and never miss a beat
‘Cause she knew how to tumble and to land on her feet
	
And they got together 
A fragile ego and a cat
And he thought forever 
Was as easy as that

Then one day it happened, the way she knew it could
Somehow it always brings out the worst when things are going to good
‘Cause he made a stand; but she was ready to make tracks
And when he saw that she was leaving, well he tried to take it back
But she brushed against his ego and it toppled to the ground
And as he watched it shatter, she left without a sound
	
Now he stares out in the empty room in the silent aftermath
He’ll relive it at least a thousand times and each time he’ll break like glass

Maybe next time he won’t stray

He only had to match the girl to his vision
He even would know the things she would like
The way they always do on television
Today his dream was realized
But not the girl he visualized

She appeared to him like a ghost
Molecules in mist that were softly luminescent
She made him aware of what his years on earth had made him
An adult adolescent
She was an intricate collage
He was a fifty-six Dodge

He came through every other romance unscathed and undaunted
But at least he was always sure he knew what he wanted
He spent his whole life rounding up the usually suspected
Just to fall when he least expected

There was something about the way she looked at him and smiled
That made him kind of nervous
He was used to treading on thin ice
But he didn’t even recognize this surface
Coming to terms with love in the new order
He flopped around like a fish out of water

She wasn’t cast out of his imaginary mold
Wasn’t she the type that usually left him cold
Yet it was this mystery that wouldn’t release it’s hold
She painted him into a corner
This time for sure he was a goner

Like a dream that was slowly creeping into reality
Something he thought he recognized
But still couldn’t call by name
The features were all hidden
No matter how hard he strained
Standing just beyond his sight 
Covered by a blanket
That was woven from shadow and light

How often his life would slip into a scene of film noir
And his vision of the world would fall short of how things really are
He always lost the edges 
Like the world was made of sand
And he couldn’t tell where one thing ended 
And the other began
Staring straight into the night
They seemed like only fragments
Soon he lost them to shadow and light		

The night is filled with secrets and the world is full of spies
Who doubt all their other senses and only believe their eyes
They think they found the answers 
Once they’ve seen them close at hand

There was a hi-tech spy, must’ve been a bad guy, had his gun pointed out the TV
And then a laser beam came right through the screen and I knew he was aiming at me
He spotted me and started to grin
And just as he shot again

I woke up 
Was in a cold sweat just as I was about to scream
I woke up 
Took a deep breath, told myself it was only a dream
'Cause I was still in bed
The pillow over my head

I woke up, threw on my clothes and headed on out the door
Ran a few feet out into the street, right smack in the middle of a war
The sky was foreboding, the bombs were exploding, I knew this would come to no good
And in a single flash, it was reduced to ash, I thought there goes the neighborhood
Then I saw something streak past
And just as I heard the blast 
I woke up 

I woke up 
Was in a cold sweat just as I was about to scream
I woke up 
Took a deep breath, told myself it was only a dream
'Cause I was still in bed; 
The pillow over my head

I woke up and there she was staring at me from across the room
Offered her a shot of Jack, she poured it down her back said, “I use that much for perfume”
Then she grabbed the bottle, drank half with a swallow,I knew this girl was tough
She said, “Whatever you got, you take your best shot, if you think you’re man enough""
Well I was ready to take the test 
But the moment she slipped off her dress 
I woke up
I woke up

I woke up and the sun was shining; the alarm clock was ringing

Alone as he could be

Looking for signs of life out on the sea

Needing to feel he’s loved and love someone too

Guess I’ve had worse goodbyes
There was no wanting to be friends
No accusations or lies
Just a message from my newest old love
Telling me we’re through
On a postcard from a seaside motel
Every room an ocean view

On just a little four-by-six
Space for so few words to say
She scribbled down some hasty lines 
Her goodbye sent from miles away
As she enjoys the cool ocean breeze 
She could’ve signed “not missing you”  
On a postcard from a seaside motel

All her reasons were piled up against me
Like everything that slowly went wrong
Blocked my view of what I might have done right
A mile high and a mile long

I was running wide open when it started to pour 
Set my mouth in motion; never touched the brakes 
I was averaging about ten miles a mistake 
Racing down the highway, guess I made my mark 
Stripped gears and a broken heart 

She was jumping out of her seat before I came to a stop 
She slammed the door so hard I felt the whole car rock 
Her suitcase in her hand, I knew she wasn’t turning back 
The place she told me to go is not on my map 
Racing down the highway, guess I made my mark 
Stripped gears and a broken heart 

I popped the clutch and left my goodbye on the road 
Drove hard until I found somewhere to go 
I didn’t mean to hurt her; I was just speaking my mind 
But I ran over her heart just driving blind 

Several miles the wiser; but too far to go back 
She’s moving on; I’m stuck here in my tracks 
My pride still riding shotgun; forcing me to drive 
It seems all I do is tear things up inside

We’re no off our rocker
We’re just mutually unbalanced
So we won’t be separated
We’ll be post-nuptially segregated
Choosing alternative lifestyles on the devotional fringe
We’re the maritally challenged

It’s not that you don’t love me, you’re only amorously deficient
The feelings that are missing are just emotional omissions
And we’re not running around, we’re seeking non-committal explorations
So we’re not going to hell, we’re headed for subterranean destinations

Tim Ponzek,"She came to town in a rusty old Valiant held together by a prayer
Loaded down with all her old dreams, old maps of how she got there
She probably made some wrong turns that threw her off track
Maybe she kept going to see where they would take her or maybe she’s working her way back 

She made her home a refuge where life couldn’t get her down
In her bedroom she hung pictures of angels and black velvet clowns 

I first saw her, she was waiting tables, pouring coffee in my cup 
She was looking down and smiling, just as I was looking up
She laughed at my old jokes, told a few of her own
I hung around as much as I could and one day she took me home 

I became her companion, we were the talk of the town
And I woke each morning and saw angels and black velvet clowns 

We laughed away the evenings, it was just the two of us
Sometimes on weekends I’d work on her car, patching up the rust
Then one day when I was away at work and the sky was the blue of her eyes 
She packed up and headed for the interstate and never stopped for goodbyes 

Everyone saw her leaving, she drove through the center of town
Through car windows they saw her angels and black velvet clowns 

Now each day I think about her, it’s just as lonesome as it sounds
But each night I have dreams of an angel and her black velvet clowns",Black Velvet Clowns,2017

The hands don’t move at all
They just point to the twelve and the nine 
Where our love was lost in time 
There’s the phone that no longer rings 
And a bird with no voice to sing
Ever since you gave me this broken heart 
I’ve been collecting broken things 

There’s our house that’s in disrepair 
Like there’s no one living there
All the curtains are torn and so thin
Still you can’t see out or look in
There’s a hope that no longer clings
And an angel that lost its wings
Ever since you gave me this broken heart 
I’ve been collecting broken things

And this box right here contains
All the life that still remains
So many plans and beautiful dreams 
Broken promises, we never will redeem 

In the loneliness of my night
I reach over to turn on the light
But no light shines through the shade 
Gone are the shadows it once made 
There’s a tomorrow with nothing to bring 
An abandoned wedding ring

Fixing other people’s problems, sometimes his ’68 Dodge
He found Claire stranded one summer day, when her car just up and stopped 
Two weeks later when she kissed him, her car ran just like a top 

In the fall when they married, the whole town talked & they agreed
Claire was much too young and pretty, Thomas, too old and too naive
Claire was seen with a man at the movie show, then again at the ice cream stand 
Thomas would not believe a word of it, even after the trouble began 

Poor old doubting Thomas reasoned away every broken promise 
He won’t let the truth come out, he prefers the benefit of the doubt 
If he won’t listen to idle gossip, then he’s not really being dishonest 
He suspects the truth is something he can’t use

When the baby was born, he just assumed the boy was his
Still Claire went on a rampage, crying, “I’m not ready for this” 
With the baby in his car, he drove over to his sister’s place 
There his son was raised
Still Claire couldn’t stay
Poor old doubting Thomas 

Sometimes in quiet moments, when there’s whiskey in his glass
He’s staring at the shadows, I know he’s thinking of his past

With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise

Tim Ray,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low (Trio Only),2016
Tim Ray,"It's hard to learn 
How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

My faith has gone 
Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

I'll go along hoping 
Someday you'll learn
The flame in my heart, Dear,
Forever will burn!",Yardbird Suite,2016
Tim Reed,"If there were no words
no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
no way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
untill the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

and even if the sun refused to shine

You and me together
The storm outside, the fire is bright
And in your eyes I see
What's on my mind

Turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping
Up heavy inside here
And know you feel the same way
I do now

We kiss and sweat

See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl just tonight

Float away here with me

But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends

Go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Tonight let's go all the way then

For fog in my eyes

For the fear in my life
From across the great divide
In the distance I saw a light

My body is bent and broken
By long and dangerous sleep
I can work the fields of Abraham
And turn my head away

Standing there
With broken dreams
I have seen the flaming swords

Who told me of his crazy plan
He'd been walking there for twenty days
He was going to walk on
For twenty more
Said ""How about a drink or a bite to eat?""
He said ""No, my faith is all I need""
So then, save me
Save me mister walking man

Just give me faith, make me believe
Come on, save me

Come on, save me

Or am I too far gone
I see to get back home

How about you take a ride with me
We could kill some time, shoot the breeze

Oh, maybe if you walk, but you should drive around

Come on, save me

Perfect situations must go wrong.
But this has never yet prevented me,
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Looking back, I could have played it differently,
Learned about the man before I fell,
But it took time to understand the man,
Now at least I know I know him well.

(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side,
And though I move my world to be with him,
Still the gap between him is too much.

But I was ever so much younger then,

Tim Richards Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Tim Rosenau,"I fell asleep around 2 am it’s almost noon
And now my mom is bangin’ down the door of my room
She said my pager’s bouncin’ and buzzin’ up off the floor
And now my friends are jumpin’ and shouting outside our door
I growled at her and pulled the covers up over my head
She laughed and slammed a pillow on my face and shook my bed
She said I might just wanna peek out the window
Sat up and squinted, took a peek out the window

It snowed it snowed it snowed, today let’s go out and play
It snowed it snowed it snowed, today

Hallelujah, snow angels rejoice
Let your wings unveil and lift your voice

I grabbed my toboggan and boots and I was out the door
I didn’t know that I was walking right into a war
Sliding down that icy walk feelin’ chill like outer space
Turned in time to catch a snowball right upside my face
My feet they slipped and suddenly I was up in the air
I hit the ground… laughter came from everywhere
I jumped right up and joined the making of this joyful sound
And then we all fell back and waved our arms and legs around

It snowed it snowed it snowed, today let’s go out and play
It snowed it snowed it snowed, today

Tim Russ,"Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage, where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock-and-roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn",Holiday Inn,2001

And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone

Ich push mich, lieb es, auszurasten
Bei Frau'n draufzuklatschen
Tausend Flaschen, hol nur Vintage

Flyin' jets, I'm overseas
Ride my cars through foreign streets

Liftin' everything that I dreamed
What they say, I turn 
I work hard and I got it
Now my face is everywhere
And nothin' they can do about it
Don't pay for nothin', I get it free
It's Timati, around the world
Afterparty after the party
In my room, got all the girls
Throwin' TVs out the window
Lamborghini made my limo
We turn it up, out of control
But fuck this rules, let's rock along
Every night's a party
I do this 8 days a week
Get up, let's get started
Cause rockstars never sleep

Com minha lata na mão, loira gelada
Canto para o povo ver
Carnaval, festa de largo

Vou curtir meu bem querer
Eu quero uma Latinha
Transbordando você
Eu quero uma Latinha
Pra botar o que beber

Ela é livre, ela é free
Ela é dó, ela é mi

A Timbalada tá de banda
Tá de bandinha
A Timbalada tá de lata
Tá de Latinha

O povo todo tá de banda
Tá de bandinha
O povo todo tá de lata
Tá de Latinha

Timbalada,"Todo o dia é o mesmo dia
A vida é tão tacanha
Nada novo sob o sol
Tem que se esconder no escuro
Quem na luz se banha
Por debaixo do lençol

Nessa terra a dor é grande
E a ambição pequena
Carnaval e futebol
Quem não finge
Quem não mente
Quem mais goza e pena
É que serve de farol

Existe alguém em nós
Em muito dentre nós esse alguém
Que brilha mais do que milhões de sóis
E que a escuridão conhece também
Existe alguém aqui
Fundo no fundo de você de mim
Que grita para quem quiser ouvir
Quando canta assim:

Toda a noite é a mesma noite
A vida é tão estreita
Nada de novo ao luar
Todo mundo quer saber
Com quem você se deita
Nada pode prosperar
É domingo, é fevereiro
É sete de setembro
Futebol e carnaval
Nada muda, é tudo escuro
E até onde eu me lembro
Uma dor que é sem igual

On these funky beats right here you hear him?
Uh huh, uh huh, now, how many people want to, huh
Learn this method that I have with these beats?
Uh huh, uh huh, now

How many songs I'm gonna hear on the radio
That sound like mine? Uh huh, uh huh, now
To have a partna as well as my friend
Well I have two partnas as well as my friend
And one goes by the name of Maganoo A.K.A. Magoo, word
You know what I'm saying? I'm putting this man down
'Cause he got it like that, don't bite him

And of course Missy Elliott
We put it down like that for the 96 and 97
[Incomprehensible]
This is my dialogue on this album
It's Magoo's album featuring me, Timbaland
You know what I'm saying?

'Cause he's so ill, I can't even rap over it
Maybe Magoo can rap over it, but I can let him rap over it
'Cause I got my man Jimmie D on that engineer board
And we do this like you know everyday, all day 24 hours

You know what I'm saying, I'm making this money
I ain't got to rap, you know what I'm saying
All I got to do is talk on this track
And you will still buy it, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's like that, so Missy tell me what I'm gonna say

Vroom, I got 'em baby, beep, beep, beep, beep

Big up to Larell High
That's my east school coast, word

Timbaland,"See, them other crews could not figure me
It's the Mag and double ooh, got that fat CD
Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my club Willy
Fake MC's getting assed like they eatin' chili

Only way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown 'cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin' me but you ain't O.J.
I'm 'bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay

When I bumble, watch your back 'cause I sting like bee
This ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't cool Moe Dee
Watch a movie, now, you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850, sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin' in my be-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin' 'Who's the Man?'

They call robber 'cause I pack much heat
Don't call me now, because they dig the way I speak
I'm like a genie because I've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado

Come, follow a mad brother where'll there be no sun
Tomorrow you be sayin', when can we meet?
My office hours are nine to five
Ain't that right Maganoo, Maganoo? Right

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night

Now gimme that and run with the
Party people, are you ready for Tim and Maganoo?
As we come, rum and Coke, won't you kick a verse two

Yo I'm 'bout to get it started like I'm Hammer then I farted
You retarded if you thinkin' Brandy really broken hearted
I departed doin' dirt, lookin' up your girl's skirt
Keep it Steve Martin style, bustin' loose like jerk

I get up like town, gimme, don't say no more
Got them scars on my face 'cause my health be poor
You Milli Vanilli, I'm Kurtis Blow like eighty-fo'
No, I don't want your girl, she be suckin' my big toe

You get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet
Peace to Tupac 'cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot
Make a block then make a circle then I rock that spot

The rappin' Don, I make a dyke go straight
If you think I'm cute then you up too late
Make no mistake, I'm a question with no answer
Riddle me like the Joker get burnt like JoJo dancer

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah

Misfit until I fucked Jill on the hill
Look out, heads up, to the girls, let's buck

Like night, shade grows, workin' dope, mind flows

Why life around and wit one kiss she set me free

Goodbye to loneliness, 
And so long to my heartache,
Now that joy has taken over, 
And decided to stay
Her love lifts me up, 
Like no other love before, 
With every beat of my heart, 
I'm holding on, hey

Just look what she's done for me, 
Just erased all the sadness away, oh oh oh, 
I could never repay her debt,

The thug muscle
So whistle if you hear clear
Gon' get you close and yous a dead man like last year
See most fear

These slugs bust the most wanted when they just appointed
I stomp dogs and leave em froze because you know you fronted
Too many MC's not clearly on this hype tip
I'll fuck yo mic and catch you later on some snipe shit
Extended clips I represent because my thugs trip
Easy boy, I'm stompin' corners where them drugs flip
Ali Baba snakin' lakin' trustin' north shit

I told you that I'm project strong
You took me wrong and learned that thorough cats don't last long
Alias the Don
I leave it messy like I'm Joseph Pesci
Don't fuck around, you ever test me and you'll have to wet me
I'm ghetto fabulous
The mob crush the Lord just, never be discussed
When there's dirt involved, niggas leave the mouth closed to hush
I rush club scenes like, ""What?""
Always carryin' the bust
The reason why, these niggas that ruck ain't had enough
I hate to peel ya cabbage back, or bitch-slap
'Cause otherwise you wouldn't quit that, to kidnap

But if it's real, my niggas hold a forty and fill
Mass grills, body armor, niggas trained to kill
I'm at the point of no return, so I let shells spill
Vinny Rush, Crazy JJ and Mush must chill
And Killa K and Johnny Hesh steady aimin' that steel
Shit's for real, my nigga P and Mike might peel

Yo Timbaland  kick it

Audiences growing like a newborn

Lyrically I murder tracks, put two in a crew 
Tell me, who want to mo' 
Catch me in the studio, what? Doing a do

Nigga, we let you know, diamond district 
Platinum Rolex's with the chips in it 
Money to burn, nigga when will you learn 
It's automatic, now I realize I gotta have 
Lifestyles of the rich, that fly assed bitch 
There's a track to be ripped, I got the hot shit 
Check the whip, I'm banging from my land to my six 
Had you screamin' at the show saying Bassey's a hit 
I got the gift and nigga's know I'm ready for this 
Eyes closed, lips sealed, and prepare for the kiss

In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, want to try 

You went out with the heels on the block

And nigga's gon' run in our spot 

Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs 

You ain't heard of me yet 

But I betcha ain't met another one yet

Nice knuckle game, chip-toothed, way of buck and change 
I want the dough, fuck the fame

About to have my own ASCAP, and that's that 
And plus a rotisserie, instead of Kenny Rogers 
And Benihana's, y'all can eat, plenty at Nas' 
Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers 
With honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim 
Liver, personification of drama 
Describe my, characteristics, murder co-signer 
Some will smoke embalmin fluid and vomit to it

Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above em, half y'all raps is 
Born retarded, now you out here tryin' to get rid of em 
You should be sick of it, I possess no flaws 
That's from the man that made your Head Nod til you Lick-ed his Balls 
Verses I spit em, when it's my turn to get em, I got hot flows 
I only do shows for burn victims 
So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you 
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin' up rap 
Who's fuckin with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on 
When you speak in my direction, watch your tone 
From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own 
It's locked and sewn I repeat nigga, watch your tone

People walkin' around sayin' to theyself ""Damn!""
People can't realize who the fuck who I am
I'm like the VCR tech they call bad
People don't know what they gonna see next
They might see Timbaland with Funkmaster Flex
Or doin' a duet with the group called Beck
Or back in the studio gettin', gettin' sex

I'm the ill nigga that loves Chips Ahoy
Timbaland where you at?

Here I go boy, I got yo' back with a Tec 9
You see them niggas creepin', what?
I thought you knew, I told you so
Never, ever step over my toe (nah nah)
I got that nigga (what what) 
From the ""V"", Static, where you at?

Here I go, if ya pearlin' in a 'lac, then turn that shit up
If ya chillin' at the club, then tear the party up
And if you got shove, let it bump bump
Not speakin' for yo' cheddah, but I keep mine in lumps
Nigga, my momma taught me that, can't sneak me from the back
So I found her chasing cheese, so I watch for dirty rats
See I'm wise like the guys, and smart like the streets
See I be rollin' blunts while Timb' be makin' them beats, Timbaland

But ain't nothin' gon' happen to me
Magoo, finish it baby

Ha ha, yeah
One more again from VA
Yes, your southern representative
Keep two Tecs in my Lex, 'cause I'm sensitive
All my competition stop wishin' for my demise
'Cause I'm hard like my dick, we'll ever be on the rise
Get between some thighs, and fuck until I'm stuck
Order the main course, four bitches, I'm serving duck
How da fuck you payin' a bitch just to fuck?
If a bitch want money for me, pray for luck
Only thing I love is weed and big cash
If yo' ass ain't a check, nigga kiss my ass

The way the one's stack ain't no way that you can stop that
You in the way girl? Boom when I block that
Treated your physique like a beat and I rock that

You got your Hustle? I ain't tryin' to Knock that
Drop carats and the ring, make sure the rock's fat
You can rise, but you ain't tryin' to stop that
You'd think I had the keys Boo the way I locked that

Oh that's your man? I think it's time to drop that
Lay it off, play it off, yeah you get the props back
You get the dress, I get the cane and the top hat
After we done Boo, I let you run the clock back

Fallin' in love? Oh never not that
Who you know who control where they gettin' jocked at?
And in Vegas I'm hittin' it up like a slot rack
If you think you runnin' game girl you need to botch that

[Chorus]

[Mad Skillz]
Now when you came in the door, I seen you before
A dime, fine all the way to the core
Thick enough to make a n**** drop to the floor
Talked in your ear til my throat got sore

Lames, she could see my game was straight raw
Specially since she bought my tape right out the store
She was like, ""Ain't you 'sposed to be out on tour?""
""Since you ain't tryin' to go Boo, what you askin' for?""

Need I say more, from the 8-oh-4
If you placin' bets girl, then you best be sure
Slick, if you sick, then I got the cure
Chrome spinnin', we winnin' Boo, check the score

Filthy rich, I like to dress like I'm four
Have the chicks fightin' like the next World War
Sure, yo you never treat em like a whore
Like Jay said, ""Love it or hate it, eith-er or""

Uhh, what, uh huh
What, like that, what

Timbaland,"Uh uh 
Hey baby how you 
Why yo face lookin' all sad and blue 
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you 
Why you trying to act a fool 
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends 
Ask Tonya and Shirl then 
Gimme a place and time when 
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets 
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me 
I'm just an average man 
Tryin' to make it in this cold world 
Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl 

I don't want to fuss with you 
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch 
Don't try to talk to me 
'cause boy I am blocking you out 
I don't want to hear a thing 
Nothing you got to say 
You should think twice 
About the way you've been talking to me 

[Chorus] 
Pack yo bags 
Get on the bus 
Ain't got no time (for) 
Talkin' all yo stuff 
Need to pack my stuff 
Since this's what you want 
I don't really care 
There's no more 
Go catch a cab or 
Get on the bus 
I ain't got no time for 
You talkin' all that junk 
Better get my stuff 
Since this is what you want 
I don't really care 

I ain't got no words for you 
So you can stop callin' my friends 
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault 
And why I ain't lettin' you in 
Too many times before 
I let you back in my life 
But this is a new day 
And this won't go down tonight

Mm, mm (da-da-duh-da-da) 
Mm, mm (who) 
Mm, mm 
Mm, mm {say what} 

Introduce you to Dolce and Gervana 
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas 
Took you from that terrible stress 
Now you telling me that I am a bother 
What kind of mess is that 
To tell a man who put you on his team 
That's just like killing a dream 
(No no baby) That's how it seems 
I worked hard to build up what I had for you 
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me and you 
So just tell me 
There's no need to lie for 
While you sleepin' with your eyes closed 
Do you want to talk, aight yo

Excuse me? But wasn't I the one that you meant? 
You talkin' trash to these niggas about to dent up they whip 
You know me and I don't think I have to explain 
You that same crotty nigga that fucked that bitch in my Range 
It was the same, life, it was talked up a good game 
Between that money and that pussy that she claim to fame 

[Timbaland] 
Look at you, talkin'-tellin' all the bullcrap lies 
It was you who made me put my hands on your thighs 
Never ever was the one that humped that girl on your Rover 
You forgot your baby cousin humped that girl on your Rover 
It's Timbaland, baby, I don't get down like that 
Don't try to explain, get yo ass to the back 
Never ever disrepsect the man that put you on his team

I done met many players that act like you 
Think because they spend some money that I'm ready to screw 
Instead of talkin' 'Hit me up around the 1st and the 5th' 
'cause you rot in a crumbed out six, you think I'm whipped 
Got numerous niggas that be rottin' my shit 
And the last thing I need is a nigga for kicks 
I stay dibbed and forever spend the louchie on Gucci 
Fuck the money and diamonds 'cause nigga, I'm still shinin' 

[Timbaland] 
Look at you, girl, talkin' trash 
Talkin' trash, actin' grown, show your ass 
Don't try to get on my track and clown 
You my queen, my mistress, my Jackie Brown

Now hot and angry and I'm getting amped 
Keep on givin' me the cold shoulder 
Now I got to get the keys to the Roller 
You gone

It was all for the paper, that's right, all for the love 
Only wanted most what ghetto girls dream of 
I need the Hummers and the yachts, Don P on the rocks 
Cardierre wrist wear with the shivel on top 
Then you lace me, now you hate me, now you tryin' to replace me 
Had a woman when you dated me, I guess I was crazy (know you was crazy) 
Tried to play me but your game's a little lazy 
'cause I hooked up and got with your man, nigga scrammed 

[Timbaland] 
Girl, what you know about Cardi and wrist wear? 
When you don't even wear Vic's Underwear 
Think before you start talkin' shit 
Remember, I'm the man with the diamonds and whips 
I ain't tryin' to beg, but a legend like those speedos 
I ain't gon get mad if you hump one of my people 
I keep tellin' you this is me you talkin' to

So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter

Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids

Cool out homie, you betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From catz who order Cris play the floor with the Knicks

It can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga man scorch your bitch
Play the floor dot Jigga man go first
Then we all rock till we all hot

You know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got the bitches in the smash, making yours drive fast
Do we get more cash than the average nigga?
All dem hoes like damn I gotta have this nigga

Chrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking

Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working

Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death

You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad

When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax, I come up with a nab
The game don't stop

Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

Are at home, by yourself

Heard the voice of someone else

Do you feel you gotta lie 
Gettin' caught up in your game 
When you can not say my name

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty

Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'

Catch me on a, backroad, or cookin in your momma's house
In your daughter's guts, or just spazzin out
Me and Bubba know what the hell we talkin 'bout
Pickin up Betty's like they was beans and brussel sprouts
We got the clout to make you bounce a little
We got the clout to make you down this pickle, until you gettin tickled
c'mon Bubba let's surround this biddle
While you work the back bit Timbaland work the middle
Uh-oh, uh-oh! I see ya see ya smile
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Down comes your blouse
Timb' been around 'em all
From white to black, even magnoli-all
To hit 'em in project halls
In back of the streets maybe right in front of y'all (ha ha ha)
Timb' and Bubba is a problem y'all
It's like hip-hop, meets effin Tim McGraw
We two fools and don't take no mess
Bitch lumber logs just to work the chest
He's country finest, I'm country best
Puttin lights out train, just get in that dress, now c'mon

{Chorus 2X: Timbaland}
Twerk a little, twerk a little, let me see you drop it
Work the middle, work the middle, let me see you pop it
Go on! Witcha bad self
c'mon! Witcha bad self

{Bubba Sparxxx}
I brought enough with me to start this bitch a college fund
Fitted Boy and Polo, and she ain't even got a son
Timmy kind of shy, told me to tell you drop it some
Here Betty, take this grand, get your monthly shoppin done
You can shake for dem but bet that you don't profit none
I got a coochie fart fetish, baby pop me one
While you by the bar I grab your boy a shot of rum
I'm the shit to the point you gotta stop I got the runs
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Why they all on Timmy?
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Ten grand is all they give me
Still got a grand left, can I let my hand rest
right there on your damn chest, fondlin your tan breast
I might just snap back and cuss a broad
But this bitch is truly blessed so I must applaud
In and out of every club in less than a hour
Sprinkle on a little Pervis like I'm fresh out the shower
Ohhhh! And rest assured Timmy runnin with Bubba
We gettin slurped by two sluts right in front of each other
And we'll probably do the same thang next Monday evening
I gotta ride this Bentley home cause Timmy's out so we leavin, now

Grab they extension, and make that coochie pop
Shake it don't stop, drop it like its hot
Whisper in her ear, I got the big T.I.P.
You gotta do more than whatchu do in V.I.P.
Grab it, and shake it, and lick it around
If you do it kinda proper I might stick around

With a little pimp fame
I'm loaded with cash, loaded with class, loaded with a lot of things
Even got a gat loaded for that ass

I love my mind, love my soul, love my body
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin' with a little short hottie
With a little piercing on her body

Yes, I get it poppin, 'specially overseas
Japenese girls even love my beat
They say, ""Timbaland's we love you
We love the dope things that you do""

Even in London they say, ""Tim, we love ya""
They even call me things like wicked and the f'n governor

Hum on a flight? Nigga you 'fraid of heights

Don't why'all see I ain't new to this game?

But I get 'em for they cash, smokin up all they hash
Treat 'em like garbage, leavin 'em in the trash

Lie for what? Never been that type of chick
Rubber band around the wrist, be the type to grip

With a Corona in the holder I'm the latest bitch

Yo (yo), yo, ay yo
Timabaland's flow infamous
Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style
For all man, woman and innocent child

I have no perimeter
Break all barriers in various areas
My sound is mimicked
Track prime minister, some say sinister

None stoppin the groove until when it's
The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats
And followed my drum pattern, but I done that
It's time to change, get more deranged

Feels more strange (doooodooooo)
Follow me through gravel and shallow trees
From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain
Through the dream state of utopia

Woke up to the sounds of that man Timbaland
Five Mexican bitches scopin us
Belly dancin, sayin ""hell, he's handsome"" in Spanish
We was fine until the subtitles vanished

Then and open fire, totin opium
Higher than I ever been in my life
Heard cries throughout the night like

Ay yo, I woke up to a bowl of rice like the Golden Child
T.V. playin like the Poltergeist, must been on overnight
I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it
Could it be the son of Christ, I decided to talk to it

In the halls I heard music shoutin beautiful calls
And I swore I heard a voice say:
It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose
But I suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move

I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit
But your ears heavenly, when I sit in this chair and produce
Then my hallway darkened
I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment
And the glance callin like

Mag spit with a sense of purpose on purpose
When you was eatin collard greens I was eatin these dreams
I stepped in dog shit and bit Skid Row twice
Only ice I had put it in my orange Slice

What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars
Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea
A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime
Twenty-six years old and I got more time

Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay
Low rent for your mom, gotta get away
Smoke, hate now, then you want to talk about the ghetto
I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat

Polo on and Nikes with a gold tooth
I'm Superman, I can spit from any phone booth
You and your cold ass crew do what you do
Just remember Mag never feel good, I am the flu

For all my homies gettin nice off that cognac
To ghetto chicks who appreciate the Cadillac
When it flip to the normal color like Mike was back
Nike hats, slightly above your nose and neck
Chucks and slacks, separated from Gores and Tecs
Chicks in packs, please, let your weave relax
I'm so gangster with this rap bouncers hold me back

[Timbaland]
Hey G, I feel you black
But let me get up in this club and show you how I act
I'm a fool when it comes to these party girls
I'm a fool when it comes to this party world
Now ask yourself, now who do beats like me?
I was the one that gave you ""Hey Papi""
I'm like Tupac, all eyes on me
Got niggas messed up in the industry, but it's ok

Ain't in the studio, little shorty I'm home
Pass the phone, I'm a call all VA
Tell Sin, call Brooke and bring some Alize

Got in the game like what, it's over man (say what?)
I spit vodka, ain't sober man (say what?)

Give me a bed so I can lay in my Escalade
You could be black, Puerto Rican or Dominican
Room 219, I don't care, send it in
I'm a jiggy guy, ride one plus the five
Make it a six, big bad son of a bitch

Sin got the Alize from home
Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on
And peep out my manuscript
Mag and Tim party hoes so you gots to strip
And I ain't playin games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin hard suit with Christopher Darden
I take about a hour to bust
Chickens want to get with Mag so they makin a fuss
Told 'em, ""simmer down, you're next
Take my headphones, listen to Funkmaster Flex
I'll be about a minute or less
Stop sittin clothes on, take off your dress""

Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick

I'm out north too, no top on the Benz
Big body, too, just like I walked out the gym
Man, I'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end
Now, I'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the Benz, with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins

Don't get it twisted, I'm gold-toothed and two-fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, I go to work
Tell the boss ""Go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce""

To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes

Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour

Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss

I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting
My name Magoo and I roll wit two stars
Every CD we split 48 bars
My name Magoo and I'm a supadupa star
Every other month I get a brand new car!

Yau [echo 2x Yau]
They still won't give me my props
Now I'm pissed off
why'all will see the other side of me
Come on
Like this

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
why'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me
I guess I gotta ride on my enemies

What the fuck would the music be, if it wasn't for Timothy
When the game is feverish, then I create the remedies
And crumble leads until I'm buzz and I'm laxed
And them hoes show me love in every club that I'm at
For every hood got' get back, what another nigga envy
But I swear I ain't no killer, but why'all niggaz 'bout to tempt me
To the point there the barrels empty until you gon' recent me
When Morpheus missing the desert of the real he meant me
Like a monster I am simply, do the records into three
Let my music not really be confused with anybody
'cause there's something like Mister Mohammed Ali in his prime
then I float like a butterfly and sting with the rhyme
and the mic happens ring with the nine
if it's drama let these niggaz tryin' to bring to my mind
I seem to remind that Thomas Crown is spoke
and if you don't love it you can shove a dick down your throat

Look at my eyes nigga, wakin' up early in the morning to the sun rise nigga
Momma yelling rise nigga get up out that bed snoarin'
if you want it go get it fuck havin' to beg for it
Even if you gotta break your neck I'm a releg for it
I said listen to behind a hot roller bread for it
Contemplating know how to work my math and bred story
I don't work my fingers to the bone until they bled storin'
So you can say that I'm a giant a preacher of habit
walking over these watches squaking the reach in the head with
niggaz watching me go free not just a week in my marriage
with the game in the cabbage with my name and my status
but I remain as the baddest motherfucker 's established
and I 'm still at it grounding that Hennessey straight popping that still mad at
Down at my enemies' face and you're like a kill habit
In front of my enemies' face I shit like a steal rabbit
To show I'm his real static and hold me ideal at it
With my poker face until I at least make a mil at it
At least make a meal love it I'm hungry and still clutch it
All for that mil ticket outta that steal lovin'

Well I was riding 95 to Virginia the other day
And I thought to myself ain't this where Timbaland used to stay
I heard he moved to New York City but he work in Miami
Only time he back round here is when he visit his granny
Now ain't it funny how the money make a man change
But shit Timmy I don't think he changed a damn things
'xcept the rap game and bust the track game
shit he be gobbeling the grammies like he pac-man
can you get with that man let's gone take it back to the roots
before them backpacking rappers with them hoodies and boots
before Sam Goddie and MTV
before these killers and these hundred dollar billars feeling making MC
before the white rap explosion before the corrosion
when we was just getting started and them doo's wouldn't open
it was people like Timmy who was kickin' them in

[Intro - Timbaland - talking]
Oh!
You know what?
([Wyclef:] good good good)
I go through a lot, since my baby girl's not here
Life ain't been the same for me
Lately I miss you very much
I want you to hear my pain that I go through (go through ...)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland + (Wyclef Jean)]
It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life
I think on it, I know one day I won't have life
People don't know me over the time be	
They don't want to know me, they want to know my G's
Le I quit, things ain't the same no more
But I'ma do my thing 'til there ain't no more (yeah)
I got a plan, I wonder how far I can go
I demand the best for myself, that's all I know
I, done seen the world become
Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me want to split a swisher, I need me one
They keep on copying what we done done
That's why I say ..

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Timbaland"")
But I know why'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
But I gotta grab all these leaves
So I must ..

[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
Hey, Timbaland you gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
([Timbaland:] My pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
([Timbaland:] I can't quit yet), you can't quit

You gotta hold on, you got to be strong
([Timbaland:] Uh, my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah

[Verse 2 - Magoo + (Wyclef Jean)]
Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)

A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Maganoo"")
But I know why'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner

But I gotta grab all these leaves, uh huh
So I must ..

The youngn's they spend their life in central Crook-lyn (yeah)
I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends
Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr. King's ""Dream"" (yeah)
I've seen best friends, turn to enemies
What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy
So hard for us to say goodbye
So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah)
The man you said was your fam in the park (yeah)
Saw your face spark when you found out he was a Narc (yeah)

[Timbaland]
I remember those days when I was holdin back
When Star Crunch was a popular snack
Would you buy you that, sneak the rest in my nuts
You know that Johnny Appleseed and that frozen cup
We grew up, but ain't you sister Jean cousin (cousin)
Just cause we older that don't mean nothin (nothin)
We still could hit the beacon, a couple of Bible meetings
Live right just like the deacons and backslide on the weekend
Now things change, not just your new love
See you never used to trip off material stuff
So I ain't mad at dude cause he rimmed up his truck
Just mad at you, you clumsy klutz
And it's no surprise how I'm feelin inside
So the only thing you ever probably did for my eye
Used to tears in the bucket, I hope you dummies loved it
Although it's over, you still my soldier (my soldier)

Can I get a hug from ya?
I'm not tryna point the finger and judge ya

I'm not tryna play correctional officer
I'm just tryna take them burdens off of ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo

[Magoo]
I first met ya at the strip club
Instead of one, had to give ya two dubs
Right from sight baby, I was past love
It must be the fact, opposites attract
Do the addition, it's a one on one thing, and I'ma lace you with bling
Cause the way you make me feel is an incredible thing
But you had to hurt me, made love to my best friend
But just like ""Chucky"" I'ma stay 'til the very end
On top of that, you was usin crack and cocaine
You had oomph, had to throw my towel in mayn
I can't judge cause I cheated, you ain't hold no grudge
I had a child with her, baby it's warm in love
Then Christmas Eve we was playin two hand spades
You rolled on up, Ace I'm sorry but I have AIDS
But I'ma ride with you, until your death
And I'ma stay by your side, last heartbeat, last breath

So I might do things you don't understand
But I like to correct your bad habits
'cause I want to make you an honest man

[Timbaland]
Huh! I got some precise questions bout my past life
Wondering why we so close to buildings on this last flight
Pray at night and keep my ""Run"" posted by the door
DMC above like Jason falling to the floor

My mind can carry of a picture perfect
Of my Aunt Mary
Her face in the mirror like she wasn't burried
I drink Hypnotiq let my conscience go (go)

Tim you need to take it slow (slow)

[Timbaland]
These endless songs got me waking up in cold sweats
What gets the real time wondering where Aaliyah at
I got a wife that watch another girl give me neck
Fix my lunch with plastic wrap up on my pita bread

I'll bite my tongue but she's so outspoken
To that box of Saran bust her head wide open
Handcuffs open my fists go up for Eminem
And when he's walking out his courtcase
I'll be walking in

You know them days when you troubled inside
All you think about fuck paying bills
You ignore em' you gone drink it out
That's the way that I feel as I am writing this

Sit back roll up a blunt take some delight in this
You been invited to a piece of my sanity
And vanity is absent does that weaken the man in me
My fantasy on side man reality bites

Who can't believe all these rappers let alone what he writes
I wasn't forced to lie to why'all but I did
I don't own a plane or yacht or eat squid but
I'm entertaining there will be no explaining

I'm criticized for having fun
Killings more enovating they say
But anyway however ignorance chooses food
It's rude to tell you how you have been screwed

And I'm a part of the problem
And its racking my brain
Excuse me miss I'm half fool half insane

I can't believe that the world is so cold
That's why I keep a runny nose
And I wish my problems would go (Oh)
People don't know me

People don't ask me no questions
Bris Sparky D was an injustice
The greatest rappers man suffered depressions
So I'm signing niggas while Whodini's taking the publishing

I got this girl ready to give me some face off
I think I need seven just to make the playoff

But I ain't gonna hit tonight, I'ma leave a good impression before I catch my flight (come on)
How I'm wrong when you ain't right?
When your dumbass will be right on my flight (stupid)
There goes my shenanigans, laugh with me

There ain't no need for panicking
Chill out, you on a private plane
Just lay your head back to this kirkle bang
Eat some peanuts, sip on some champagne

Your fly mileage go up as you give me brain
This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you

I don't know when I'll be back again
Why don't you just call up all your friends
And let's get something started

I'm only in town for two days, two nights only
I'm hoping that you want to spend these two nights on me
I like your home girls you like my homies
We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely

Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for
A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go
I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?
Only a hip, nobody has to know

She looking at me, weighing up her options
She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'
What could be the fact that I got there
Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?

I dunno but whatever it is gotta::crunk
She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada
I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar
Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow

[Chorus: x 2]

[Verse: Magoo]
Girl you lookin' right in those jeans
You been eating colligreens?
That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?
You have a house, 2 kids, and he working

There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting
But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight
Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright
I tell you what, I'ma make an exception

Clothes off, that's the truth
Clothes on is deception
Aw, yea, a macilent conception
Front or the back, hit in any direction

And baby you the cause of my erection
Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection
Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl
I really have a need to give you face girl

You said you dreamed if sex with a star
Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow

[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
(Ho) It's Timbaland I'm back (uh huh ...)
with another one you can dance, so you can relax (woo, woo ...)
My music moves you wherever you at
I play it loud, to move the crowd, I like it like that (c'mon, see'mon ...)
I know you feel the vibe, from the club to your clothes
and you'll still decide I love it
Everytime I get 'em a ride
I drop the top, turn the volume up and put it in drive
Me and Aaliyah did +One In A Million+
When Ginuwine dropped +Pony+ was the one that I'm feelin
Hey, we havin a party, come through with your crew
Turn up the feel good, do what you do

[Chorus - w/ ad libs]
[Verse 2 - Magoo]
Yeah, when I'm feelin lost and hurt, you can soothe my soul
You was there for me, music
I was goin out of control, 'til I heard Marvin Gaye
""Now it ain't a mountain high enough, when time is rough""
I turn to you, yeah
Believe it or not, I learned from you, yeah
All of my soul, I bear to you
Your not a painkiller, but I think a snare'll do the trick
And I just want to lose myself in you
I gained all my health and my wealth from you
I started thinkin me and you was just a phase
Now I can't count the days

Get a twelve pack of skins, so I can run through ya whole crew
Look ma, I know I was the one that you wanted
You gave me Naughty Eye, Seen you in the club but you fronted
You got mad blunted, Then Mag became the Hunted
It was fourth down, would've made a pass, but I punted

Sebastian be quicker
More proof than my daddy's old E liquor
I like'em Trina size, but if they ever be bigger
I put the sheets to the ground
Act bigger, make the shake stick her, so they can at least figure
Then we hit the slopes
Same amount of snow, that Johnny would it nose
No chain and ropes, I don't chestize my hoes
Just release the low, and put little me's on clothes
But still though I got (love for you)
Single mothers I got (love for you)
Fuck niggaz who hatin I got (love for you)
Middle fingers I keep'em (up for you)
Couple bottles with models
That would swallow you whole
If I vanish tomorrow, niggaz will follow the flow
See a hundred like towers, watch me pull in the load
When I come to ya clubs, niggaz will be stare at the doors

Down here the sign men don't promote it, look at us fail
Fuck it, I'ma just tell the truth as I perceive it
Most of them think our shit is useless, believe it

But me I got a love affair with all things Southern

We all ain't brothers, but this ain't the bitches neither
And all our rap songs ain't for bouncers drinkin either

Up in the cut like gay niggaz, in butt
I'm black wit Indian, my race should be mutt

I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius
Up in the sky, up high, don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam? Prepare to fuckin' die

Fuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight, but I got ten mo'
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like pop's feet, make sweat wit no heat

I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call, Maganoo, to see if he's got some indo

Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget, to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please please, brother don't slam my car do'

It costs too much money to get that shit fixed

Don't have no time, for the shuckin' and jivin'
Peep my rhyme 'cause that, shit's off-timin'

I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got
After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott

Touch my hot spot, I scream 'til I can't stop

I bump like acne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe, without da fuckin' key

No fan of Madonna, she just a damn slut
So sit you damn dog and bow to my shit
Nit-wit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grits

Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh

I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match

Bullets smackin your face and your chest just like a fuckin drumroll nigga
You ain't know me and my crew, we lockin it up
And rubberband stackin dough in Timberland shoebox nigga, and stockin it up
Too many of my niggaz at the door of the club

We put together niggaz like the dick to these bitches
Givin it to 'em in the worst way for actin too {?} bridges

Be I the Fresh Princess, rulin shit run things
Your efforts is senseless, Hariett Thus

I smoke the engineer weed motherfucker
Bitch got stuck in Wells Fargo, Brick City hooligan
Squattin at the car show - couldn't be a girly girl
if I tried; crazy slave to the live
But I'm still fly, love four by fours
Cause they ride like a toy, steady jumpin the curb
Pedestrians like ""oh boy"" I can sing, rap DJ
Work the instant replay
""Even though I'm slurrin my voice"" like I was Freeway
Get it right 'cause-o, I keep the rhymes runnin
Kind of terror FBI don't even see comin, motherfuckers

Wrap your body up, put it in a sedan
Drop yo' ass in a river, this is how I deliver

Youse one dead nigga, six feet under
Never comin back, one year later

Keep eatin donuts and drinkin that coffee

You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it

'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute

Where you at, do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else

Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright

Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

'Cause this the hot shit, out on the streets
So when you hear this CD go and COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliot]
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!
In one ear and right out the other
""Ayyio Missy you ugly!"" yeah ya mother
I don't pay attention, I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait, that it takes to hook this, huh

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Magoo]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting
My name Magoo and I roll wit two stars
Every CD we split 48 bars

I'm worth more dollars than major beauty parlors

Sitting on the top; it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV; just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week

If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it

Timbaland,"I got a feeling she keeps me in the dark
I gotta get keep my eye on her; she ain't no walk in the park
I offered this, but she want that; she, she, she want it all
You see, she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
I got a little tip from the word on the block
People saying I shouldn't get involved
But I didn't judge or try to change it
'Cause you are who you are
I'm like the drug; she's addicted to me
She can't leave me now
She always making plans to date
Come and find me tomorrow 
Goodbye, girl

[Chorus]
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I tell her easy, but her hands - they find a way
Confusing passion for the love we never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I tell her easy, but her hands - they find a way
Confusing passion for the love we never gave

I couldn't get rid of shorty if I wanted
'Cause she was down, but I was tired of playin' the role
Like I ain't know that she get around
Something 'bout this girl fascinates me
She's the type that like to hang with the stars
The way she makes me feel, it sedates me
Who knew we would take it this far?
Everywhere that I try to go, she got a wanted poster with my face on it
Soon as I walk out the door, there it is
Wanted poster up with my face on it
Can't blame myself when it's not my fault 
'Cause nothing is promised 
At least I can say I was honest
Goodbye, girl

I promise you that,
We're marchin' on

Get your legs and walk
'Cause we're not too far
A little more to go
But we're marchin' on
We marchin' on

If we lose the sun, we couldn't deny that
If we go the wind, we gotta fight back
But we marchin' on
We marchin' on
We're marchin' on
We're marchin'

The bridges are gone
And we're almost home
The end is close

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,

When you're no longer involved

Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can’t help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don’t match

Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

Before I became a feign
I took over the world
When they gave me a beat machine
And then I made my city jump, jump
Who's your favorite producer?
Come on baby, let it bump, bump
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon every time I can hold a song
A tycoon, I just went and brought another home
Who you stunting on? I'm never off
I set it off like you was never home
Was dedicated, bop bop
Lit up my way, bounce bounce
Anyway I want, private jet, get it out
Will bread do? You know what Tim about?
Ferrari 599, windows tinted out
I, I, I'm the man, my, my beats is crazy

But you gotta long walk
Try and fit Timbaland's shoes

I'm a lead that's me (ay, what's your name?)
D.O.E on the M.I.C (and where you from?)
N.Y.C, make a billion G 

Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (Okay, okay)

Timbaland, he produced, if you're a fruit, produce
Riding it in the old school
Living like I'm old school

And then I told her merci voux cou
Put it in your bag, no baby I ain't fat
When I fuck you it's a wrap
I'm a put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap
If I wasn't I'd be trapped with the mass
And I, and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at
I'll be shimmying your lock
Get the fuck up out your bed
You better give me what you got

I'm from north side queens
Next up

Ha, ay yo, believe that's me

(And where you from?) Mississippi 
But was raised in Cali

Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (I got it, I got it ha)

It's been a long time coming, I'm back
Like I forgot something important
Hey, have a problem with me?
I've faded to black like church slacks
Now I'm in a range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum
I got you head strung
It's my return like the kingdom come
I'm taking off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket
I keep your heart dropping (Bran'Nu)
Never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map
Now you wanna say I act brand new
Just like my Pradda boots
Strutting like a model do
Don't you wish you had another chance to
Get up under my skin
Fronting like you getting in it
You keep running your mouth like them frogs do
I gotta learn, you like a school dude
Cause clearly you don't have a clue
So next up

Yeah, ay yo believe that's me

(And where you from?) Alabama be the bigger G

And why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (okay)

All this dope shit never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side, pride leashing, it's over
Come to fly to drive, I'm a need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of, like a G's supposed to
They can put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap, wait, smack 'em if they say a part
Diss me, I'll put the ratchet
On you and your fading heart
I know that man never thought that it could happen
Got my shit on and then I hoped in the Aspen
Every chick I cash in, bigger pain in the ass and
Better new freak, she thicker then the last one
Naw I ain't never homie, music is my passion
I ain't show compassion at all, I be fucking
Yelling I'm the shit, if you with nobody's asking
Oh I'm on fire like the shit in the ass man
That's why I stay soaked on player

All we do is fall down
Even though we try to stay afloat
I swear its gonna kill me

And everything's coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold a prayer is all our own
But we need air we go alone
Cause I don't wanna let you go
Til we're caught in the undertow

I don't wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and its sink or swim

I really don't know her, I seen her on MySpace
Looked at her page, all I seen was my face
Her user name read, Kyjuan fo' life
With videos and pictures, set up so right

Timbaland,"Baby girl I think we need to sit and talk, talk, talk
Playing with my money, paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Blowing up my heart then stick a pen and pop pop pop
Either you bitter don't know what you got got got
I could be wrong, you could right
You probably be alone, I probably not
Well listen girl, you acting like an idiot
Really try to love you but its getting hard, hard, hard

Is you crazy, did you lose it
Are you stupid, are you foolish
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my World
Girl am I the one you playing
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away
Throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

Well I can take you back to the spot
Where you was bought, bought, bought
Make 'em return my paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Maybe you can think about the shit and stop, stop, stop
Climb up on this boat and show me how you jump, jump, jump

I could be wrong, you could right
You probably be alone, I probably night
Well listen girl, you acting like an idiot
Really try to love you but its getting hard, hard, hard

Is you crazy, did you lose it
Are you stupid, are you foolish

Okay whoa there, whoa there, is you noodle
Cock-a-doodle
Are you crazy, crazy, crazy bitch
Did you knock a couple screws loose?
I know what time it is, only cause you (cuckoo)
I got bitches jumping for me like a bouquet by the beaucoup
Are you tryna leave, ay you trippin', tie ya shoe lace
You's a dime bitch, cause you two-faced
And you gave me heads and tails
Throw it at me baby, I be the wishing well
For real though, I know our shits not perfect
We connected in our space where our love's written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger
Paper in your hands
But you can't cut me out
Bitch this ain't no game

Is you crazy, did you lose it
Are you stupid, are you foolish
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
