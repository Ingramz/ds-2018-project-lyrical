Heather Morris,"It's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go,
No one will know,
Come on girl.
Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow,
Shots of Patron,
And it's on girl.

Don't say no, no, no, no-no,
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah,
And we'll go, go, go, go-go.
If you're ready, like I'm ready.

'Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like ooh,
So whatcha wanna do?
Let's just run girl.

If we wake up and we wanna break up that's cool.
No, I won't blame you,
It was fun girl.

Don't say no, no, no, no-no,
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah,
And we'll go, go, go, go-go.
If you're ready, like I'm ready.

'Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Just say I do,
Tell me right now baby,
Tell me right now baby
Just say I do,
Tell me right now baby.
Tell me right now baby, baby.

Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,

Yeah  
C'mon  
Hey Britney  
Are you ready ?
Uh uh, are you? 
 
No one cares  
It's whippin'my hair, it's pullin' my waist  
To hell with stares  
The sweat is drippin' all over my face  
No one's there  
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place  
Tonight I'm here  
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep it that bass  
I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music  
It's like a competition, me against the beat  
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone  
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm  
Tryin' to hit it, you could die

Heather Morris,"I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world

Always saying little girl don't step into the club
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why cause dancing's what I love, yeah

Get it get it, get it get it, ooh 
Get it get it, get it get it, wow 
Get it get it, get it get it, oh

I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy

What's practical is logical?
What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there

Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me,
To another time and place.
Oh baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me,
Leaving behind my name and age
Like that
Now watch me

Get it get it, get it get it (ooh)
Get it get it, get it get it (wow)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)

I'm a slave for you. (Take that) 
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it.
I'm a slave (It just feels right) for you. (It just feels good)

Heather Morris,"“Bah, humbug!” no, that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop,
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of eighty one passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

“I'm spending this one alone” he said
“Need a break, this year's been crazy”
I said, “me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?”

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending!

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Couldn't miss this one this year!",Christmas Wrapping,2011
Heather Morris,"It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time

But say a prayer, pray for the other ones
Oh at Christmas time, it's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight, thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time (this Christmas time, no)
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (is life)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow (nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow, no)
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you, raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all? Yeah

La la la la, la la la la, la la la la 

Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time
And feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time
And feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time
And feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time",Do They Know It's Christmas,2011
Heather Morris,"I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too

So take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought it down

And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well maybe, well maybe, well maybe
A landslide will bring you down",Landslide,2011
Heather Morris,"Yeah, you may think that I'm a zero
But, hey, everyone you wanna be
Probably started off like me
You may say that I'm a freak show (I don't care)
But, hey, give it just a little time
I bet you're gonna change your mind

All of the dirt you've been throwin' my way
It ain't so hard to take, that's right
'Cause I know one day you'll be screamin' my name
And I'll just look away, that's right

Tell you I set you apart

And ask me your questions

Heads are a science apart

It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me

Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

But I think it's a cryin' shame Nashville's gone Hollywood.

You won't need a steel guitar in your watered down rock 'n roll.
An' you might even find yourself on the cover of The Rolling Stone.
You'll be lookin' mighty fine in your designer clothes.
An' you won't need the Opry; you'll be singin' on Jay Leno.

They'll put you in the movies,
You'll have your video.
An' if you're young an' sexy,
You'll be rollin' in the dough.
You'll sell a million records,
Oh, that must mean you're good.
Move on over, Ernest Tubb,

I'm still giggin' on Broadway, makin' rounds on Music Row.
Hopin', maybe someday, I'll hear my song on the radio.

The sun so strong and rage so deep 
I keep waking to find I've been dreaming again
And the sound of the ocean is not a plane

In newspaper columns they write about me
Round dinner tables and cocktail parties
I'm a heroine and a tragic figure
I'm a heroine as I'm lying here

Sometimes I cry

Sometimes I wonder

And why we need to touch the ground
And why I didn't keep on heading
Right on up to heaven

Not the golden mountains I used to fly through
Here from below the sky?s a painting 
In a child's room with the future waiting
But not for me

I look up at the birds flying overhead
My sentinel's true but the signals dead
It's been 500 days of hope and sorrow
500 nights with no tomorrow
And the poetry and the best of me
And the heart and the spirit and the sex of me
All fell into the azure sea
In the tailspin with the last of me
And my wings, and my song, all that I knew is dead and gone
I'm weak and tired but my will is strong
And my hope lives on, my hope lives onS

There are problems I know I still have to face

The world is turning, ever changing
Every turn keeps hope alive
No matter what tomorrow brings, we can`t hold back the hands of time
Too many days I`ve been afraid
Too many nights when alone I laid
Human and full of frailty
But the world is mine and belongs to me

I`m not afraid
Know that the sky is broken
And my shoulders can hardly take the weight
The spirit and soul still open
To believe there is something more than fate

The world is turning, ever changing
Every turn keeps hope alive
No matter what tomorrow brings, we can`t hold back the hands of time
Too many days I`ve been afraid
Too many nights when alone I laid
Human and full of frailty
But the world is mine and belongs to me

So be brave and face
The world is not a dark and hopeless place
And in time your heart will heal
`Cos I have the strength I hold the key
And the world is mine and belongs to me

The world is turning, ever changing
Every turn keeps hope alive
No matter what tomorrow brings, we can`t hold back the hands of time

You bear the scars from someone heartless and selfish
Altered your mind 'til you can't see your way
And now you stay 'cause you feel worthless and foolish
Hey girl don't let him drive you insane

If you could see your glory
Embrace yourself and all of your beauty
If only you could see your glory
That inner grace, why can't you believe me

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and change your world

With burning hands he demands night and day
You sacrifice your passion under stress
Don't let those tears you cry be cried all in vain
Don't loose your soul through your selflessness

If you could see your glory
Accept yourself and all of your greatness
If only you could see your glory
Follow your dream on to a brighter day

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and change your world

Keeps you hanging on with empty words of love
He believes that it's enough
You know in your heart it's less than you deserve
But a change is gonna come

Change your world
Look inside yourself
You've got to change your world

Change your world
If you could see your glory
You can change, you can change your world

Change your world
Look inside yourself
You've got to change your world

Change your world
If you could see your glory
You can change, you can change your world

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and
Better look inside yourself and
Better look inside yourself and change your world

Sometimes I hold my breath for the longest time
Close my eyes and watch this free fall flight
Scared of coming down from these dizzy heights

I need a snapshot before the last light fades
'cause you're looking at me in that way again
Want to capture this in case this moment ends

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here
'cause only heaven knows what's happening
I do believe we can make this world stand still
If we don't change a thing

Last night I had that same old dream again
Walking on a tightrope without a safety net
But I had my wings because you were there

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here
'cause only heaven knows what's happening
I do believe we can make this world stand still
If we don't change a thing

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here

I've been down and I've been lonely
Every day another story
About what a heart is going through

When I think it's all behind me
History knows just where to find me
But when the clouds come into view

I know wherever the road goes
I will always find my way
I know wherever the road goes
Every heart will have its day

Heaven knows just where I'm going
I face it all not even knowing
What future lies ahead

But they will put your faith in something
You don't care how hard you're running
If you're never running scared

'cause I know wherever the road goes
I will always find my way
I know wherever the road goes
Every heart will have its day

Is where I wanna be

Shying from trying
Seems the easy way
Such an easy way
But there's no future

The answer is easy if you take it logically

She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said, I appreciate that, then would you please explain about the fifty ways

She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe, in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right

I tried she denied so I got to work
I gotta let her know the way her smile tend to glow

You want me at home, but I'm all in the move

My alarm goes off, I'm a reach for the snooze

So I talk to myself, I give plenty time
To all these decisions lying in my mind
Holding hands or put my arms around her waist
Neither one of the these two will I try in haste
Taking my time to work the problem out
Yet trying to convince her that there is no need for doubt

Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions

So I tell myself again to thing deep within
And remember when we first met we were only friends
Throw a kiss or try to taste her tender lips
Will these be the factors that will make our lives a trip
But just in case things don't settle well with her
I'll say that I'm sorry and keep hoping for the best

Heaven,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)

Place in a room and lock the door

Unlock the door; go in and see

Can't work; I am tired all the time
Can't eat since my appetite has gone
Can't think when it started to go wrong
Can't move; I've no energy at all
Can't see any end to this in sight
Last week, I could do all of those things
But now, I am just the man who sings

I've searched around for years and years
I've drank in bars; destroyed careers
Sold on a need to be famous

I've seen the good in men survive
Only to fail when I arrive
Convincing them I am blameless

I was the man with future sight
I would change fortunes overnight
Knowing for me it was painless

(chorus)

One day in April, 10:15
Awakened screaming by a dream
Something that touched me was burning

A diamond pin fell from my eye
Then something strange began to cry
""Your will can stop this world turning""

Since then I've fought more than I should
Against the will that I withstood
Hoping I could be its master

But now the dream is all I see
There is no hope of breaking free
One song away from disaster",Song with No Name,1981

For those who think young will still survive
Making their move
Hoping to prove
That they can face
This big city, small world, big time
Chorus
But now I know their ways
I found my place
Saw their true face
There's nothing to stay for so I'll go
I'll pick up the phone
Still searching for home

Alone but not lonely I move on

Heaven 17,"Chorus:
Who'll stop the rain
Who'll stop the action
East side west side
The world moves on
I heard a rumour that fires were started
Flame in the streets and tension uncharted
Bigger than life at the edge of the city
Ashes and diamonds gleaming with pity
[Chorus]
Between midnight and dawn you slept through the deadlines
Believe in me and we'll hit the tall headlines
Look up and laugh be happy today
Here come the waves count three pray
[Chorus]
A global affair in big house U.S.A.
A moving violation angels over Broadway
The next voice you hear will be the main attraction
The next time we love standby for action
Meet me tonight and love me for ever
Let's be happy let's be famous whatever the weather
The rain must fall and night time is calling
Golden boy and golden girl it's a great day in the morning

Heaven 17,"Here as I sit in this lonely square
This train of thought runs through my mind

I like it best when the choice is mine
I want to be free to speak my mind
And if I cry I want no-one to be there (be there)
Free to do what I want to do
And you should share this freedom too
If I lie it must be for a reason

We've come a long way now
There's still a way to go
And still we're moving onwards
For all that you might think we are innocent
Innocent people
We are free

I'm working hard
I'm looking for the week-end
Oh! my good god
How the work is hard
And when it's down to getting home
We don't know what to do - do you
I hurry home
All the people seem to hurry
Don't push me on
I think for myself
We move as one
We like to keep it all together

I take it all
No problem at all
I'm a page in the book
Oooh take a look
I'm a part of the whole
All my body and soul

I want you to know I've cried me a river
Why can't this taker change into a giver
Why can't I work it out
I want to be free

Free in what I'm choosin'
Free with no excuses
Free to see the people
And to move ooo! ooo! ooo!

Free to choose my lover
Free to choose my brother
Free to need another
And I do - I need you

I'm having a ball
I'm part of the wall
No-one sees me at all
I'm asking for one dance
I know that there won't be a second chance
There's no return
I'm ready to burn
I think I'll never learn
I'm looking for direction
What I need from you is real protection
I've done my best
I've failed the test
I don't care about the rest
Won't someone set me free

Free in what I'm choosin'
Free with no excuses
Free to see the people
And to move! ooo! ooo! ooo!
Free to choose my lover
Free to choose my brother
Free to need another
And I do - I need you
",Free,1986
Heaven 17,"The tenth of may
It seems so far away
When you and I were strangers moving close together

Sometimes it seems
It's almost like a dream
Driving across the country and the road is endless

If I were you
Don't wait until tomorrow
I'd lead and wouldn't follow

Walk away - today
If I were you - please listen
Walk away - I'd say
If I were you 'go away'

The first of June
The summer came too soon
But from the day we met I knew you'd never go away

Sometimes I feel
The passion's not so real

Finding it strange to be together, not alone

If I were you
I'd smile and close the door
I'd never ask for more
Walk away - don't stay
If I were you - believe me
Walk away - I'd say
If I were you 'go away'

Fourth of July
With an independent sigh
I think the time's arrived to take what's going to happen

Wise men may say
It's easier to stay
But if you are there I'm only wasting time


If I were you
I know I'd want to hurt me
It wouldn't disconcert me
Walk away - I'd pray
If I were you - I'd leave me

Walk away - today

If I were you - please listen
Walk away - don't stay
If I were you - believe me
Walk away - I'd pray
If I were you - I'd leave me

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

I'd leave if I were you

A precious smile poor little girl so pale and proud

Hold me
Control me
So proud

You're on the town you're on your own
Don't walk away don't pass me by and run for home

Hold me
Control me
Don't run for home

I followed you I tracked you down
And now it's time to go underground
I've never been alone with you
So hold my hand and lead me through
If you say I'll make room for you
If you do exactly what I tell you to
The saddest face the perfect thing
It's time to face what's happening

Now that you're here
There's nothing to fear
Just look at me
Look at me

There's something I cannot resist
Let me tell you what it is
It's when you walk away from me
I promise not to set you free
Don't try to run I'm everywhere
If you escape then I'll be there

I know a place where we can talk
I'll walk with you, don't hide away
And leave me here alone
Not here alone

Alone with you
I think you always knew
Just look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me



You're on the town you're not alone
I can't give up poor little girl so sweet and small
So sweet and small

Control me
Please

Hold me
Control me

It was a purely physical thing
We talked and talked I like your mouth
Your mind's o.k. but I love your body

We haven't slept for days now
Ooh your body
We haven't slept for nights
Ooh your body body
Nothing's going to stop me
Ooh your body
This is a title fight
Ooh your body body

I made you laugh and you made me cry
I know it's wrong but I'll never miss you
You locked me up I don't know why
But there's no law against escaping

It doesn't really matter
What you say to me
Nothing's going to stop me
What will be will be

I had a dream I was on a train
I met this girl she was prettier than you
Do what you want but don't wake up
Close your eyes and let's get started
I know a secret locked in ice
Until I die I'm taking action
There must be more that we can do
Where am I just when I need you

Wrap me in your body
I'll wrap you everywhere
No one's going to miss me
I know that no-one cares
I've been in your body
I've been in your car
You know I've had enough now

And an angel writes a word across the sky
When the people laugh there's no sound
And the words keep falling round and round
And the world just keeps on watching
Till there's nothing left to buy

I don't believe it
Well they don't care
It's moving closer
It's everywhere

Everything around us turning red - red
You walk into your home
You walk it talks - red

The fever's taken over everyone
And the only law that matters is the gun
The people run from every slum
There's nowhere safe to watch it from
The underground is over now
There's nothing that can be done

I don't believe it
Well they don't care
It's moving closer
It's everywhere
Everything around us turning red
You walk into a bar
You drink it smokes - red
You're driving in your car
You turn it burns - red

As the air becomes too hot for us to breathe
There's none of us that really want to leave
From the frozen north to the sun soaked south
The colour spreads by word of mouth
Till there's no-one left to talk to
We just look into the screen

Well I don't believe it
Well they don't care
It's moving closer
It's everywhere
Everything around us turning red - red
You walk into your home
You walk it talks - red
You walk into a bar
You drink it smokes - red
You're driving in your car
You turn it burns - red
You're on the telephone

That in the world today

They try and take away the blue skies
And all the children that play
But it's a curious fact
In every hour in every place
That when the right time arrives
It feels so good to be alive

Somebody

Can't you see
I'm a boy out of fashion

Somebody

I'm not part of any nation
Now I'm back in circulation

When the right time arrives will you be there
Tomorrow or a hundred years from now
I've wasted years just keepin' movin' on
It never entered my head it was here all along
Don't ask me why just lead me on

Somebody

Talk to me
I can hear what you're saying

Somebody

Tired of the city air
If I gave you the future would you meet me there

I used to stumble and fall
I'd run to everyone that called
Since you appeared it's been a lot of fun
Between you and me, between the truth and a lie

You have a husband and I have a wife
And when you ask me why with your kissing eyes
How could we be so wrong, oh my oh my oh my
You'll always be there the same as any other

You like a sister and me like a brother
Like all the times I used to dream

Somebody

Smile at me
Let me know that you're near me

Somebody
I can see that you're near me
It's the only sound on the city street
If I sing you my song will you move your feet

Somebody
Every moment you're nearer
I'm broken down and in a mess
Your love is all that I confess

Somebody
Now I know that you're near me

I don't mean to shock, I don't mean to scare

But the world won't change and I don't care

I used to dream
One day somebody near me
I can't believe you're making me

A rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
There's a strange new rhythm in my life
It burns like the sun and cuts like a knife

Everybody chic or shoddy
Turn it loose and use your body

Trade ambition for position
In this low society

Next July we collide with mars
Have you heard it in the bars
In this low society

No more pay and lots of leisure
In this low society
Low society

I'm just doing what I can
In this low society
But I'm an incidental man
In this low society

I give away what others sell
The secret's yours so never tell
'cause if you do you'll go to hell
Low society

Side by side and always tired
All for one and no-one hired
All that's left is love inspired
Low society

And when the party is complete
And you're still standing on your feet
The taste of victory is sweet
Low society

And darling don't forget
In this low society
To turn off your t.v. set
In this low society

The most important thing at all
In this low society
Is not to stand too tall
In this low society

I can see rome as it burns
All the passion and the power
Turns to ash within an hour
No more play and no more pleasure

If you go high then we'll go higher
Beyond the sky without a sound all around

And we've evened out the scores we are contenders

I'm telling you so pay attention
These words of truth come from above
In God we trust and he has told me
I need you now and I'm talking love

We want a piece of what you're selling
Put up your hands and face the wall

How much it costs to walk so small, and we're so tall

We are hiding in plain sight we are contenders

I always get all that I want
Though some are foolish we are braver
Than those who do not have a bomb

How it started in such a strange way
It ended in a strange way too
And this is why I am singing this song for you

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish thing to do
Give your heart to someone new
It's a foolish thing to do
(yeah)

We've all made the same mistakes
One foolish glance one smile we made
A hundred thousand feel this way
While other people are just waiting for the day

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish foolish thing to do
Go when you want it
When you need it
Don't just believe it
For the first an last time
Stop !
You'd better look around
One day you'll walk into the room
Your eyes will meet
You'll fall in love too soon
The next time you might hesitate
The chance is all those rooms have eyes
So don't forget

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a such a foolish thing to do
To go and give your heart and soul to someone new
It's a foolish foolish thing to do
So when you feel it
When you can touch it
And you believe it
For the first an last time
Stop !
You'd better look around
It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish thing to do

The dark starts moving in
And that's the truth
Right now you're on the stand

And I feel like the judge
Who needs the proof?

Waiting for the news
Will it ever come my way?

Just leave me now, you're making my blood run cold

Now that she has gone
I've got to shake the pain, act like a man
The sweetness that's inside
Will slowly die away

Who do you think you are? you're making a fool of me
Make no mistake, this is no fake, this is the end
Just shut your mouth, make room for someone new
So guess who's back, it's happy jack, and that's no lie

How was I to know?
So discreet, no-one speaks
Take the word from here
If you play you've got to pray

Who do you think you are? you're making a fool of me
Make no mistake, this is no fake, this is the end

You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream

Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me

And all my age implies

I began to realize
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight

But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me

Back from work, she's not home
Another evening angry, all alone
She arrives and he departs

Tomorrow - the century
what will we find
the fall of mankind?
Milleniums are calling
is this the end
should we repent?
Nobody knows
what will happen tonight
will there be darkness
or will there be light?

The future - uncertain
Heaven or Hell
no one can tell
The fury - the fire
mankind must learn
or we will burn
Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be
who can forsee our destiny?

to step into a new time?

No one can change it,
no one can change it

Ready to face life, to carry on
look straight ahead

Lord, tell me that I am wrong
and that life will be the same

for you are our only chance!

The Evil is coming
to seek and destroy
and we are it's toy

Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be

Another night with your head in the oven
Simmering like a heat wave over you
Sweat drops hiss at the bottom
Blood droplets cook like glue

And left me for dead
Went out and lost your senses
Went out and lost my head

In deceit, disbelief, they're laughing
As we faint in these houses burning down
In the smoke and the heat we're gasping
For a breath of some fresh air in this town

So save for me, the pleasantries
How pathetic this must sound
To patiently still be craving
A taste of the good life in this town

They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
Went out and lost your senses
Went out and lost my head

In deceit, disbelief, they're laughing
As we faint in these houses burning down
In the smoke and the heat we're gasping
For a breath of some fresh air in this town

We'll make believe
That we still dream
Of one day finally getting out

They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
Went out and spent your senses
Went out and sold my head

They left you with nothing [x2]

And left me for dead

For one last breath

Better believe it

Take this back
If you really want to
Take this back
I'm counting on you

Want to take you aside
And softly whisper questions at you
As you slowly die, gripping to my shirt
The consolation prize for coming in last
Wishful thinking, cut down to size
Cut up on the floor watching me smile
Take this back
If you really want to
Take this back
I'm counting on you

Won't you please step inside?
Something to show, something to share
My knife still wants to hide
Deep inside of you
I'll announce the grand prize

Before your eyes
Better fucking believe it

Take this back

On a dead end world in which she cannot live
And she'd love to leave for someplace all alone
And she'd love to live
Far from every face or name she's ever known

No, I can't say I blame her
No, I can't say I blame her

My oh my dead end girl

My oh my dead end girl made a promise to herself
That this dead end world would be forced to eat itself at gunpoint.

No, I can't say I blame her
No, how can you blame her?

On a dead end world
One of which she cannot live
And she'd love to leave for someplace nice and cold
And she'd love to live far from me or anyone she's ever known

...But then I stopped and took the picture, 
Found myself looking in it, 
Found myself drowning in it,
Lost myself for a minute,
The same face in the same mirror
With his eyes a little clearer
Read what the reflection's sending,
This is only the beginning.

This garden's growing hunger like your growing fly trap smile
This coming harvest season finds it's stretching on for miles
We do or kill most anyone to be
Its do or die, it's up to you and me, G.O.D.

G.O.D.

We magnetize this opposite by pull of frequency
The anger grows in fields as far as naked eyes can see
Blood drops from the sky like acid rain
From tongue to nervous systematic shame
We do or kill most anyone to be
Its do or die, it's up to you and me, G.O.D.

Tell me heather
Why do you never answer the phone?
When it rings, does it sing ""caller unknown""?
Telling you to run away and hide
To early in the day for talking
I got a feeling you're busy painting
Children in death and decay

Heather, do you ever answer the phone?
Is it me, or does it seem you left it at home
Telling me you went to get provisions
Maybe off to find new scissors
Maybe you're busy taking pictures
Up in the cemetery

Oh..ohoh

I hear the calling of the skeletons under the sun
The skeletons under the sun

The day is dying, big smile
Pose through the camera, a giant step for your kind
One of a kind

Don't leave just yet
Quiet on the set
Let's give this one more go
Make ourselves ill, poppin' sugar pills
Will swallow nice and slow

Don't leave just yet
We've just had a wreck
I'll need your name and phone
And water for these slow-dying trees
Where gardens used to grow

The sky is falling, straight down
It's come to crush us and leave us in our blood to drown
Barely making sound
The streets are painted so still
Can hear the breathing, the making sense of the spill
Enough to make you wanna kill

Don't leave just yet

Got a vessel that we've chartered
Into the wide open sea
The two of us dearly departed

Bring a book with a happy ending
A remix of the message sending
Shining clean, this guillotine
New and improved
Patent pending

Place a curse on the hearse were driving
Cut the brake lines, end up dying
Glad to be traumatically
Against the ropes lost all hope trying
Finding ways to break the silence
And to quench our taste for violence
Shadow free monstrosities
Crafting the fine art, have patience

High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back in six minutes or so

Heavy D,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
Does she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be	-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'm a let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

Close the door, dim the lights

I can slick ya body down from your head to your feet
Make ya smile from a simple kiss

Check it, roll over my lover, the sun is beaming
The hot water's runnin' and the bathroom's steaming
Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun

Yeah, we're snuggled up now it's time to buckle up
So call me later, cutie and I'll pick you up

That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl

Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth

Baby
What'cha gonna do
Baby
My, my, my love

I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
That was so long ago that I thought 
We could make a new start
You left me broken hearted
From the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you want to come back

What'cha gonna do without my love

Now that my love has gone away from you

Sweet memories of yesterday 
When it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, 
Holding you tight
I wish you know that a woman
That you learn to leave today
And it's a shame that you want to come back now baby
My love has gone away

Free me, slavery, let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like they're filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And I get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way I flip a skip

Sisters call me dadi Puerto Ricans call me papi
You can't stop me

I'm coming with rough rhymes
Rugged beats I'm passin' time on satin sheets
And where I came from, some come from
Tryin' to diss the champion, numba one, Don Gargon
Talkin' behind my back like they alla that, they ain't halfa that
Matter of fact, I'm the one who put the town on the map

I like to do bigger show, so I can get bigger dough
I hung out in crazy states, sit down and ate crazy steaks
In the morning time I wake up with a rhyme and some Corn Flakes
Rap is a stallion's job, hung out with Italian mobs
I been around the world with pretty girls and they credit cards
Around in the Source van, got paid when my horse ran
And despite the verdict, I'm still a Mike Tyson fan
In the trench I get ruff, on the stretch, I get vexed
Eddie F's on the set who's next to get wrecked
Mr. Sweeperman, time to do the sweep up
Brothers couldn't keep up, spendin' too much time with their feets up
Listen to it, this is how I do it
When I wreck a set rhymes float like fluid
Lord have mercy on those who curse me
You don't appreciate, neither-for you don't deserve me

Didn't it make you sick when I went pop and I kept my props 
and I blew up the spot and was large on your block
I know it did that's why you formed the committee
Of a bunch of itty bitty silly Milli Vanilli hillbilly niggies
never mind all the chitter chat, cause I got a bigger bat
Step out of line again to get your jaw tapped
Don't try to play me for cream puff
Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin' but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin' on my porch countin' loot drinkin' lemonade
Swingin' with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type

And this is how it's done, Uh!

I did good in my hood as a youngster
The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me you don't deserve me
Fly like Kinievel, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to

Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Come be a single, let me see you mingle jingle dangle

Yes, too many brothers be fakin' moves, or frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block, drinkin' and passin' brew
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy, don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle y'all was crumbs who didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo lookin' clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin changed... wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer

Back in the day I used to punch clocks now I'm drippin' props
And countin' loot, and shootin' hoops, and lookin' cute
in tailored suits, made for the Over-weight Lover
undercover, over cover
You know my MO I do damn well on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one, quick to figure one
two, three two one, ah!
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to crab the last, now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother where you rub it 'fore you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honeydips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix

Been in plenty drawers, far from just okey-doke
Not into no hokey-poke, although I may drink a Coke
Hell no I won't smoke no coke

Save all the chitter chatter, I make em split and scatter
I keep em goin for blocks, I never ran from cops

I treat a mic like a bad habit, I grab it I gotta have it
A funky junkie flippin styles is automatic
I freak a beat like a prostitute, I'm always in hot pursuit
I'm tryin to get lots of loot, lots of boots
Do jungle rocks like a hustler moving crack
Like a muscl-er microphone damager handin ya rough like a wrang-ler

I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone

Feeling like a champ and push up on a cutie
Phone digits I'm stamping
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumping in stereo, people said, ""Here we go,""
A cutie down in front said, ""Heavy you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Loving is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Living on the mike makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you couldn't even hang
We've got our own thang

We've got our own thang

Original, smooth criminal, dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let them all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let them all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought
Started with a pow and I'm going to end it with a bang

Heavy D,"I'd like to dedicate this song
To everyone who's cried before
Who's felt pain and suffering before
This just ain't about me
But most importantly I'd like to send this song out to my family
I love my family
'Specially my mother and my father
I wanna thank you for being so strong
God bless you, I love you

Sometimes I sit back, relax, sip on Cognac, reminscin'
on how it used to be, when we were kids
Laughin' at the things that we did (uh-huh)
Damn near broke but we knew how to live, peep the scene
Mom and dad, bustin they ass, fourteen years
In the night they would pass, each other
Tryin' to raise six of us one sister, four brothers
Two deceased, laid to rest
And I miss you cats, what I wouldn't give to bring you back
To fill the void that you left in my heart
Your last breath really tore me apart
And I'm sorry if I never said I loved you enough
I truly did

[Chorus]
Ask, heaven, heaven is there room for me?
Cause I believe, that's where you'll be
Waiting for me, at the end of a stairway to heaven

Aiyyo I swear to you, I'll put it on the bible, no lie
On the days you guys died, I seen daddy cried
I was shocked, y'all know how tough pop is (f'real)
But he really turned soft when life stopped his kids (damn)
Speakin' of kids? Yours - beautiful
Promisin', beautiful, I wish you could see 'em
So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
And I'm doin' my best, to make sure they alright
When I was young, some big kids stole my bike

Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
When I was older you started smokin' and you sold my bike
I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
I was sad cause the crack had control of your life
And you couldn't even put up a fight
You told me Dwight, I promise lil' brother, I'ma make it alright
You left home, and you died that night - damn I miss you

[Chorus]

Thanksgiving day, came home, surprised the family (surprise)
Walked inside the crib, the mood was wrong (damn)
I heard my moms in the background screamin' on the phone (dad what's goin on?)
I rushed to get closer like yo mom, what's wrong?
She said your brother's buggin' out, hurry up, take a look
I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin' a lot (I'm scared)
Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
I was frightened, he was fightin' to breathe
Mumblin' somethin' ""Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave""
I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
He felt calm, as he died in my arms
OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, ma you hear me?
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, I love you",Ask Heaven,1999
Heavy D,"Do you ever feel like, gettin' high?
Do you ever feel like, leavin' this world?
Uhh do you ever feel like, you ball by yourself?
Do you ever feel unnecessary? Uh-huh

Don't call me crazy but sometimes I feel like gettin' up
and dancin' in the middle of the night
I need a way to release myself
from all the pain and the pressures in life (one time)
Considered drinkin', but then I started thinkin'
I'd probably drown away my life
Gotta do somethin', too many people frontin'
You see I need a way to get by

[Chorus x2]
That's why I get hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
from dancin' in the middle of the night
Dancin' in the moonlight

Last night I'm cruisin' the Meadows, better known as the ghetto
Seen a shorty named Black
At thirteen he's deep in the drug scene
And there probably ain't no turnin' back
He said dat, momma was smokin', he tired of bein' broke and
poppa locked up and ain't comin' back
I almost cried when he looked in my eyes
and he said he didn't care if he died

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin' for years, cried a river of tears
I can't take it no more
I seen the bible dying
And I don't wanan cry no more (just ain't right)
Too many people pushin' too many people
Hate is just a sequel, cause still nobody's equal
And I find myself lying
'Cause I don't wanna cry no more

Flourish you with jew-ell rings real-ly
If you tell me that you do love me sincerely

Put your coochie in Gucci cause we ball in the night
Call your girls tell them that your flowing with water

Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night
Slab riders, chrome twinkies
Smokin' sticky
Iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

[Chorus]x4

It's me, BP
From the middle of little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee
Its no surprise
How we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize
Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best
Take time to perfect
Every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
""I don't got time for them chicks""
They be tryin' to resist
Every time I insist
They submit
Bitch don't be lying on my prick
I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Hold your eyes in my direction
If you strive for perfection
Just watch the pro
But its like a chore
You gotta cap and go
Feel the most
Catch me next time I gotta rock a show
Got's to go
I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

Such a long way to go, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly

Right, right, yo, yo
I met her at the Copa, Cabana (how she look?)
Word to mom she bananas, I swear I wanna slam her
Like Tito Santana, can't wait to wrestle her
Curious about the sex in her, Gabbana dress on her
Next to her, this cat champagne sippin', ice drippin'
Roleys on the cuff, but she winked at Big Stuff
""How you doin papa?"" I'm just chillin' mama
Loungin' - ""Smokin' on your Cubana?""
Si, the, first name Heavy
She started rubbin' on my big belly, stay put
I can see how you got these other dames shook
'Cause from the first look, a nigga like Water was hooked
She said the name was Carmelita, boricua, from Puerto Rica
Tu eres, mi amiga, senorita?
Me and you friends baby, me and you friends
""Si somos amigos""

[Chorus]

Hu-huh, yo
You the flyest lady in the house ""true"" hear Heavy out
Wanna make you scream ""uh-huh"" wanna make you shout ""okay""
Let me feel this real, baby we can chill
Week in Brazil, D keep it real ""mmm""
Sleep in the hills, native of the 'Ville
Native of Jamaica, steady makin paper ""aight""
See all the linens be crushed plus the gators
Smoke Cuban, gruff smoke Garcia Vegas and dutches
Did world tours, ten buses ""what""
Live life deluxest, some friends is hustlers
And them the type of cats that will spend ends to touch ya
See me I wanna love ya, just flow with Diggy
And I'm always thinkin' of ya, that's word to Biggie
Let's blow this joint and splurge the city, damn you pretty ""gracias""
And them niggaz over there can't stand you with me

Heavy D,"[Chorus]
It was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh 
Is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ

Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear Jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls

Your bodies just a vehicle transporting the soul
It's what's inside people, is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus]

It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder

One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

A vester on his chest and Rastafarian is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got, lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not, do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames, same blood that runs through my veins

Watch for sticks and stones stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile there's a natural mystic

Blowing in through the air so keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and clear, 
But most people won't even hear spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

Heavy D & the Boyz,"Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, ""Man, you amaze me!""
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say ""Hey good lookin"" with the sweetest position
""Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW""
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

Heavy D & the Boyz,"[Chorus]
Stay-ay-ay, stay dedicated
You've got to stay-ay-ay, stay dedicated
You've got to

Now this is called ""Dedicated,"" though not a dedication
It's about an obligation in a love situation
Guys don't get your girls, girls don't get your guys
With a, relationship full of backstabbin' lies but
I'm here to tow the line on all that shooting
Dedicating is the subject I'm speaking
On therefore I need your undivided, attention
Sit and listen to, what Heavy D mentions

[Chorus]

Pretty lady, I heard about your status
You're lookin' for the boy, whose pockets are the fattest
And, I also know about your bad repu-ta-tion
The things you so, inside of a rela-tion-
Ship behind their backs, you use and abuse them
But in the face you say that you love them
'til one day Prince charming comes along~!
You say to yourself you won't do nothing wrong
Saw your opportunity, decided, to grab it
But first things first, you kicked your bad habit
Told your best friend you had the perfect life
But what can never go wrong, never will sound right
You see this guy that you're with is what like you used to be
He takes a lover undercover, destroyed your dignity
It used to be a joke but now the table's turned
You're the one gettin' dissed, so I hope that you learned
That he was lookin' for some action, some satisfaction
You thought it was, a physical attraction
Then one day, you caught your lover out there
When you asked him why he did it, he said he didn't care
So remember next time, you wanna act crazy
What comes around goes around, pretty lady!
Lady, lady, dedicated

[Chorus]

You got yourself a girlie and you should be coolin'
Tryin' to play the role, but who are you foolin'?
Your lady's not the one she knows about yo' schemin'
Time to wake up, pal, stop dreamin'
Before you know it what you got gets gone!
You're sittin' in the room with your head down mourn-ing/morning
Time comes, who's there it ain't your girlie
You said that you missed her, shoulda thought about it earl-ier
Cause now you're all alone no one to play with
No one to squeeze you easy, or give your a kiss
Kiddly kiddly kiss, kiddly kiddly kiss,
There's a lesson to be learned, I hope that you're learning
Cause if you disregard it's love you will be yearning
What I'm tryin' to say is this, read between the lines
Don't make a commitment you can't stand behind
Cause in the long run it'll only grow worse
And the love that you have'll turn out to be a curse
You struggle wit'cha life, tryin to get situated
When all you had to do is chill, and stay
Dedicated",Dedicated,1987
Heavy D & the Boyz,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say cuff
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so

Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em

Pretty lady, can I have a
Second of your time, in order to deliver
This message that I've been keepin'
Inside for a while since you and I been meetin'
Now, I've seen girls, in many different places
Some were fly, some with okay faces
But all that you could do was stop and glance
But you really caught the eye of the Overweight Prince
That day that I saw you shoppin' in Macy's
Tried to track you down, girl you drove me crazy
Now that I got you, in front of me
You'll never wanna leave Heavy D, I'm gonna make you love me

I'm gonna make you love me, love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me, love me
I'm gonna make you love me

It took weeks, tried to track you down
Spent a whole lot of time searchin' all around town
It's like you disappeared, without a trace
Then one day I turned around BOOM you're right in my face
So just chill, cause this will only take a minute
Sit down relax while I start from the beginnin'
See I am Heavy D and entertainment's my profession
There's no stoppin love when I start my caressin
I can make your day, much brighter than the sun
And if you like good times, I'm the one for fun
I won't try to buy you girl with my money or gold
'Cause love can't be bought is how the story is told
But I'll treat you really good, give you all of my time
And each and every day you will be on my mind
All I want from you is truth and honesty
You'll never wanna leave Heavy D, cause I'mma make you love me

Yeah you see what I'm sayin?

Born in Jamaica, Mount Vernon I grew
But I still do my shopping on 4th Avenue
Buy my Nikes from Chambers, then walk down the block
Get the gear that I wear from Buddy's Big Men Shop
When I start to get hungry and it's time to eat
Buy a burger from Shabazz on 4th Ave./3rd Street
I'll never forget the place I got my start
Around the corner from the crib, and it's called ([Name] Park)
Now in this park I'd bang a beat on a seat
Bust a rap for the crowd that was really unique
For an eight year old kid inside the fourth grade
And when I grew they all knew that I'd get paid
And on my way up I took no shorts on the court
I played and I slayed, I learned and I taught
And shortly after that everybody was yearnin'
For Hev to go down in the town of Mount Vernon

In the summertime, when the heat is hot
We can cruise on 3rd Street, but you can call it the block
Fly ladies out there in the short set suits
Nothin' ugly approved cause all the girlies are cute
Would drive in my Blazer for a four-dollar fee
Written on the license plates is my name 
When it's time to chill we go to 4th Street Park
Pick up some brew from Big Lou when it gets dark
Go watch the summer league games, sip and forty and max
Cheer for the winner and watch the competition get waxed
When that's all over it's party time

N-N-N-Nikes I'm for 'em, out the store I bought 'em
And on the b-b-basketball c-court is where I score them
I'm a, Nike bro I sing SOPRANO acapello
Every, tour that I go, oh no, I won't forget 'em
It's a dangerous thing, never leave home without 'em
Trade in my Nikes I won't even think about it
On my beat the Nike's sleeker, the other kicks are weaker
Eddie F pushes the button, the beat comes out the speaker
The boy can do the dancin, he also does romancin
And when I park my Blazer in my Nikes I'll be p-p-prancin'

""Niiiiiiii-kes"" 

Oh what a relief!
They have red ones, yellow ones, black ones too
White on white, green on white, just to name a few
My crew is fully equipped from ah, the tops to bottom
Everything Nike makes, Heavy D & the Boyz got 'em
So hurry up-ah, run to the store, go get a pair
Guaranteed to be the #1 sneaker of the year
If you're buy yourself, get some for your crew
We wear N-Nikes so you should wear N-Nikes too

I see a cutie, my duty is to flirt a little

Kick some 'sation then expand
to the next territory, got some people waitin' for me
Get to the spot, drop the top, and then we history
Move down to the Apollo, 125th Street
That's where the people of all creeds and colors meet

I'ma let you know, when I go I grow
I flow and blow, to the right tempo
My rhymes are in there, for me it's very simple
I'm the extraordinaire, others they can't compare
to the six foot two half inch light skinned brother with curly hair
An Overweight lovin' machine, the Boyz are my team
My presence is felt, hearts melt like heated ice cream
When I'm through, stand up and clap your hands

Appreciate what you did, and I hope you keep doin it

You don't jiggle 
Once you jiggle
So hand over your love
Cause it's heavier
Than it'll 
Move like a Mover
Sye wanted to groove 
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we'd be schoolin'
So I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb)
But not like this
We can waltz and turn 
Rumble tumble and twist
Then you think you gonna give in
Phantasies relivin'
So lay down and relax
Lover my lady
Lady love of my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world
When you drop me kisses 
You're so cute you drop the bomb on me
Stretch it 
Stretch it
Flex it
Flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey, Dokey
I'll bless ya
Blessin' like buddha
Buddha as the bless
You can lay down on the Lover
Put your head on my chest

Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 
Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 

What can we do
What are we gonna  do
Roses are red and Violets are blue
Love is good and plenty
If you get plenty good lovin'
Do me right
Do me right
My lonesome dove
Tell me one more time
What is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure
As to what is going down
But I'm feelin' Hunkey Dory
'Bout this thing that I found",Now That We Found Love [Club Version],1991
Heavy D & the Boyz,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

(Free Slick Rick...)
",Don't Curse,1991
Heavy D & the Boyz,"[Chorus]
I don't want to go outside
I just want to be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I want to do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course 
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus] 

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

[Chorus]

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 
'Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy 
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth
Yella
Complexion
Vanilla
High Low
Aphro 
Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my
Heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can 
Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got
But for now 
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be",Let It Rain,1991
Heavy D & the Boyz,"Intro (spoken):

People, 
The world today is in a very difficult situation,
And we all know it,
Because we're the ones who created it.

Chorus:

What's wrong with our future? (4x)

Verse One:

Bust this

How long will this last?
A friend to the end, a memory in the past
You think you're big, cause you walk with a shotgun
I got new for you, your days are numbered, son
Why don't you get yourself a job?
When your kid grows up, do you want him to rob?
Look at your mother, teardrops
She just received a phone-call from the cops
""Your son will do life, 'cause he wigged a man's wife
Shot her with a gun and stabbed her with a knife."", or
Take a look at your mother's heart torn
She just received a phone-call from the morgue
""Your son is dead from three shots to the head.
The killer left a note and this is what the note said:
""Never be bigger than you are.
 Never try to pose like you're a superstar
 Next time you rob somebody, and you give him the death-wish.
 When you pull the trigger, nigga, don't miss.""
Is this how you want to be
Dead on the street or locked in a penetentiary?
It's cool to be free
And it's alright for you to be you and for me to be me
Look at you, 15 years old
Coolin on the corner with a can of Old Gold
Whatever happened to school?
Yeah, sure you go to school, but you go to be cool
To sport sneakers that you took from somebody
To talk about the kid that you bucked at some party
Life is a gamble, and you're losin
Before it's too late, brother, you better start choosin
Left from right, right from wrong
Or you'll be singin that old blues song
(Yo, you gotta buck em, or else you're soft)
Some I knew thought the same, now they're way up North
You ain't soft, cause you didn't buck a shot
Put the pistol down, throw up your hands, see what ya got
Old Johnny Walker from around the block
Was livin' rather large 'till he got knocked
He had ""Livin' Large"" on his Jeep plates
""Livin' Large"" on his real estate
He even bought a diamond ""Livin' Large"" name plate
He used to look at cops and smile in their face
Drive a BMW and pump the bass
One day, he made a move for a friend
The f-are-iend, the voice said, ""Yo, I need ten."", Johnny said, ""When?""
Later on that day, Johnny went to play the game he normally plays
To do a favour for a chum
You see, a friend is a friend, but then, some are none
Cause when he got to the spot they were supposed to meet
All he found was a police-infested street
I guess havin a friend is rough
Cause now Johnny's up north, doin push-ups, gettin buffed
You see this chain I've got, I've got it, honestly
You see the clothes I wear, I've got it, honestly
You see the Jeep I drive, I've got it, honestly
I work hard, it ain't easy being me
Never had an excuse for life
Just did what I did, now what I do, I do it right
""Jumbo, Jumbo"", they cry on the block.
5.0, 5.0, lay low, here comes the cops
Man, your lifestyle is petro
On your knees again, because Jumbo said so
""Free Mandela"", you cried
But you still sell dope to brothers and sisters outside
Martin Luther King had a dream (ooh yeah)
That's exactly what turned his dream into a nightmare
Malcolm X said, ""By any means necessary.""
He didn't mean just for you, brother, he meant for everybody
Maybe if we were still slaves, we'll be closer; however
Pickin cotton was bad, but we picked it together
I pray for you, and you pray for me
Sincerely yours, the overweight lover, Heavy D

Repeat chorus to end",Letter to the Future,1991

Heavy D & the Boyz,"Here's to you
You have gone through struggles, suffering
This one goes out to everybody in the world, but especially on the street level
Because I know where you comin' from and some of the things you do, I can understand
So through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

What is a friend for? Through rich and through poor
Kinda like a marriage balanced on a different floor
A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another
So in essence, a friend could be considered a brother
You laugh and you play a lot, you talk and you say a lot
But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot
I'm talkin' about you, you who have the time
A time to be my friend when no one else would be mine
Problems were nothing because I had my man to share them with
Hills were nothing neither, cause I had my man to climb 'em with
I'm really proud to say that I truly really knew you good
And oh, God's blessing from the entire neighborhood
And as the days drift, drift into the future
I laugh a little louder at the times that I was witcha
This one's for you and I truly hope you hear me
And through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2] 
You'rrrrrrrre on my miiiiiiiiiiiind (You're on my mind)
And I wish you a peaceful journey (Peace!)
Brother I hope you hear me

In the corner, sits the little girl in tears
The shadow of a man overwhelms her fears
""Mommy, mommy, NO!"", the words of a battered child
The wicked, wicked mommy has the sticks swingin' buckwild
""Mister, mister, do you have a dime?
See, I'm hungry and I'd rather be a begger than do crime""
Sure here's your dime, go make a big ten bucks
Now sneak around the corner, get your joints and go beat him up
A kid on the streets, doesn't want to be beat
So he hangs on the block 'til his pop fall asleep
Missing kids on the milk carton
A lunatic kills kids for kicks and gets pardoned
Baby girls run away from home, huh
And two months later, they're stars on child porn
Tracks on the arms of a minor
Suzie ran too, but she'll be dead when they find her
Kids on the street movin' drugs, the thugs' growin' up fast
Wouldn't stop when one gets plunged
Junior stole a Benz with his friends
But got caught, now he's doin' time with twenties and tens
For the rest of his life, he learns to lean on the wall
And prays for the day when his number is called
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2]

Pardon me, mister warden, I'm askin' for a pass
To come for some of my brothers who made mistakes in the pass
It's really not their fault, you see times are hard
And it was probably difficult for my man to find a job
Before he was forced, forced to make a living
By lying, stealing, and eventually killing
No one was born bad, we're all God's Kids
So who's to really blame for the wrong that he did?
And speakin' about the law, what are they for?
To beat us with a stick face down on the floor?
You preach and you preach that you want crime to stop
If you want crime to stop, stop hiring crooked cops
So hear me brother man, hear my plea!
If you want success all you gotta do is succeed
Love, life, pain, death
What else is left on the travels of life's steps?
In life, we lose, get bumped and bruised
The road you choose not necessarily a cruise
You giggle for joy, shed a tear for pain
There's a lot to lose, and a lot to gain
Though when you walk on the streets, try to walk on street smarts
When you see your man down, try to have a little heart
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x4]

Yeah, you're on my mind
Peace
Hear me now brother

Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your stealing, stop your stealing
Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your killiiiii-ehhhhh-eeeeaaasah
Huurrrrrrrr 
Who!

Take my hand, take my hand
If you need somebody, you can trust on me!
Ha, you can lean on me
Yes, you can errrr-aaaaahh-yaaahyaah",Peaceful Journey,1991

You need to stop, you're just a ghetto flop
Here comes niggy-nack piggyback, knapsack sacky
Saki, classic like a Kawasaki, rough like Rocky
Sisters call me dadi Puerto Ricans call me papi
You can't stop me
Uhh, 'cause in these times of tough times
I'm coming with rough rhymes
Rugged beats I'm passin' time on satin sheets
And where I came from, some come from
Tryin' to diss the champion, numba one, Don Gargon
Talkin' behind my back like they alla that, they ain't halfa that
Matter of fact, I'm the one who put the town on the map
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick
""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""
Yeah funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Yeah yes, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

Here comes the bigger bro, I'm on the slow nigga flow
I like to do bigger show, so I can get bigger dough
I hung out in crazy states, sit down and ate crazy steaks
In the morning time I wake up with a rhyme and some Corn Flakes
Rap is a stallion's job, hung out with Italian mobs
I been around the world with pretty girls and they credit cards
Around in the Source van, got paid when my horse ran
And despite the verdict, I'm still a Mike Tyson fan
In the trench I get ruff, on the stretch, I get vexed
Eddie F's on the set who's next to get wrecked
Mr. Sweeperman, time to do the sweep up
Brothers couldn't keep up, spendin' too much time with their feets up
Listen to it, this is how I do it
When I wreck a set rhymes float like fluid
Lord have mercy on those who curse me
You don't appreciate, neither-for you don't deserve me
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""
Yeah what? Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh talk about it alright yeah
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

[Repeat x8]
So break it down
""So easy does it on the DL, the Heavster""

Didn't it make you sick when I went pop and I kept my props 
and I blew up the spot and was large on your block
I know it did that's why you formed the committee
Of a bunch of itty bitty silly Milli Vanilli hillbilly niggies
never mind all the chitter chat, cause I got a bigger bat
Step out of line again to get your jaw tapped
Don't try to play me for cream puff
Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin' but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin' on my porch countin' loot drinkin' lemonade
Swingin' with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""",Here Comes the Heavster,1993
Heavy D & the Boyz,"Oh yes this is special
This is direct from what we call The Funk House
This is a total dope phat one, knowhatI'msayin?
And this is how it's done, Uh!

I did good in my hood as a youngster
The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me you don't deserve me
Fly like Kinievel, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to
a cordless you can't afford this don't get aboard this flavor
Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Come be a single, let me see you mingle jingle dangle
Sammy Davis Jr. was Mr. Bojangles
(Here is something you can't understand)
Tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man? (The Heavster)
(""Time keeps on slipping"")

Yes, too many brothers be fakin' moves, or frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block, drinkin' and passin' brew
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy, don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle y'all was crumbs who didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo lookin' clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin changed... wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two
Who's the man?
Like I said, this here, is official

Back in the day I used to punch clocks now I'm drippin' props
And countin' loot, and shootin' hoops, and lookin' cute
in tailored suits, made for the Over-weight Lover
undercover, over cover
You know my MO I do damn well on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one, quick to figure one
two, three two one, ah!
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to crab the last, now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother where you rub it 'fore you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honeydips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Everything here, is phat, knowhatI'msayin?
Don't take it the wrong way, but I'm lettin' you know

The big man, the bigger plan, the nigga jams
Quick to figure and I pack Palladium stadium stands
Rugged raw, clear the floor
R&B hardcore plenty more. been on plenty tours
Been in plenty drawers, far from just okey-doke
Not into no hokey-poke, although I may drink a Coke
Hell no I won't smoke no coke
Steady steady but ready for pitty petty
Big and heavy, far from Chevy, so save your gas for Getti
Mic check it, microphone check it
Watch me wreck it; I'm never half steppin'

[Chorus]

Far from a chump, I'm a champ, I get amped
When I run through camps, gimme some plaques on the stamp, HEY
I need a girl who got plenty trunk, who knows I got ghetto funk
Not into blunts but I be on a stunt hunt
Got crazy drama, dramatics, big girls in Bahamas are addicts
So now they cling like static, dig it
I rolled up on some old wonderama type of drama
I'ma, comma, big belly punanny momma harmer
Bag a cute, so NIGHT troops, I'm all about
Two scoops, I cut loose, just me and a few troops
To handle static to me is automatic
I never panic or stall, I'm gigantic so yes, y'all

[Chorus]

Uhh, king of the big boys, bigger boys, don't even matter
Save all the chitter chatter, I make em split and scatter
I keep em goin for blocks, I never ran from cops
I roll with my flock, and get props from dreadlocks
I treat a mic like a bad habit, I grab it I gotta have it
A funky junkie flippin styles is automatic
I freak a beat like a prostitute, I'm always in hot pursuit
I'm tryin to get lots of loot, lots of boots
Do jungle rocks like a hustler moving crack
Like a muscl-er microphone damager handin ya rough like a wrang-ler
Sew up cities with girls of pretty, known for the nitty gritty
My flavor, is major, you're itty bitty

Hey, heh ha ha

Tonight is dedicated to you
Do what you want to do, have fun
You call the shots, and it's on me ha HA
Here we go
Bring it onni onni onni onni on one

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
Tonight is your night so do what you want to
Grab a girl, grab a guy, say hi, say ho
Throw your hands in the air and let the music flow
Now here we go, once again it's the man with the wings on the double
Got my shovel and I'm diggin for skins
Now everything is alright, nobody's uptight
Could be the lights but all the girls look right
Now I'm coolin in the corner with a cutie named Judy
and a girl named Sheryl, said she been around the world
Went and strolled on her own through the club on a rub-a-dub tip
tryin to snuggle up wit another honeydip
I see my peoples on the dancefloor doin their thing
As I 'gan to sing, believe me it's a black thing
The party's all jumpin, everything is alright
So do what you want to do 'cause it's your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

I need the dancefloor stacked with back-to-back blacks
and blunts to get contact, some stunts to get tumtaps
The night is still young, the fun is still fun
Everybody move your body, it ain't nuttin but a party
Folks can I get a ""ho""? (HO)
Ladies can I get a ""oww""? (OWW) so hear me now
It's a regular routine thing where brothers do their thing
It ain't Arsenio, but it's definitely a night thing
The atmosphere is a rap-most-fear
and everybody from nowhere to somewhere is here
So act like you know, and float with the flow
You heard it on stereo, see it on the video
Everybody's workin up a sweat
Even though roughneck is with the roughneck step
The party's all jumpin, everything is right
So do what you want to do 'cause this is your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

I got the goods and the goodies, some brothers be in hoodies
and some girls be in tight jeans, it's part of the night scene
Everybody is freshly dipped
Brothers be at the bar actin like movie stars, set to flip
The whole crowd's in a good groove, eatin the good food
Soul food to keep you in a good mood
Champagne flowin, people hey-hoin
Time just passed without ya even knowin
Party's like pretty sights, late nights
Flexed from a set to the next set, it's aight
The party's only jumpin, everything is tight
So do what you want because it's your night

I see my peoples on the dancefloor doin their thing
As I 'gan to sing, believe me it's a black thing
The party's all jumpin, everything is alright
So do what you want to do 'cause it's your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I need the dancefloor stacked with back-to-back blacks
and blunts to get contact, some stunts to get tumtaps
The night is still young, the fun is still fun
Everybody move your body, it ain't nuttin but a party
Folks can I get a ""ho""? (HO)
Ladies can I get a ""oww""? (OWW) so hear me now
It's a regular routine thing where brothers do their thing
It ain't Arsenio, but it's definitely a night thing
The atmosphere is a rap-most-fear
and everybody from nowhere to somewhere is here
So act like you know, and float with the flow
You heard it on stereo, see it on the video
Everybody's workin up a sweat
Even though roughneck is with the roughneck step
The party's all jumpin, everything is right
So do what you want to do 'cause this is your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I got the goods and the goodies, some brothers be in hoodies
and some girls be in tight jeans, it's part of the night scene
Everybody is freshly dipped
Brothers be at the bar actin like movie stars, set to flip
The whole crowd's in a good groove, eatin the good food
Soul food to keep you in a good mood
Champagne flowin, people hey-hoin
Time just passed without ya even knowin
Party's like pretty sights, late nights
Flexed from a set to the next set, it's aight
The party's only jumpin, everything is tight
So do what you want because it's your night

		[Chorus - The Boyz] x2
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

Heavy D & the Boyz,"Everybody, shake your body, we don't ill, we chill at party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional, unquestionable
The lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
With my particular style, particular, extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing on lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicen McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-colaist, doing very well
Because it took the right road to this
Path, make the undertake, the recordbreaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'm going to end with a bang

We've got our own thang

Picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Here while I'm lamping
Feeling like a champ and push up on a cutie
Phone digits I'm stamping
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumping in stereo, people said, ""Here we go,""
A cutie down in front said, ""Heavy you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Loving is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Living on the mike makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you couldn't even hang
We've got our own thang

We've got our own thang

Original, smooth criminal, dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let them all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let them all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kinda digging me
But every time you see me
You seem to be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
I'll catch you the next day

When I focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low profile type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Chorus]

I'm standing, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
Yeah, and I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A rubber to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the boogie down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus]

Hey, yo, hey, yo
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

I never stumble cause I mumble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
It was your trip
Scared a grip
Because I'm losing it
I did what's clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm-a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand

The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track

But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo, lookin' clean

All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say, you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley

And countin' loot and shootin' hoops and lookin' cute
In tailored suits, made for the over weight lover
Undercover, over cover

I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop, who's the bigger one? Quick to figure one

Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I spend quality time 
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right

You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than

You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you 
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you 
You walk like talk like sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me

She's the type of girl to put her crew on the map

Seen her chattin' with this dame, I had to go and get her name
She with her friends, they at the bar gettin' they drinks on

Way the skirt is fittin' black, who hittin' that
I'm kickin' game up in my head steadily sittin' back (I feel ya)
Now I'm think in the attempt to attack the
Shorty that I'm lookin' at that's lookin' at me
But soon enough I get my nerve up
{?} passes me a drink as Pretty Lou he sparks the herb up
I'm with my Uptown team, makin' noise

And take shorty home that I got my eye on

Last night the club was tight, shorty's dead right
But you stood out the most, so I had to play you close
Nuttin' less than, black essence, your presence real strong
Dudes all around you frontin' hard, gettin' they trick on
I ain't mad, I just watch you gas 'em up, then I watch you pass 'em up
Then I step up, now look, you shook
You stuck, what's yo' name, what's yo' digits, what'chu drinkin'
My treat and when they steppin' you get swept up off yo' feet
My mission, first position, backs I twist 'em listen
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy

In conjunction with the funk that keep it blazin' out they trunks

Heavy D & the Boyz,"Everybody, shake your body, we don't ill, we chill at party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional, unquestionable
The lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
With my particular style, particular, extracurricular, smoother and
Trickier
Throwing on lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-colaist, doing very well
Because it took the right road to this
Path, make the undertake, the record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'm going to end with a bang

We've got our own thang
Picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Here while I'm lamping
Feeling like a champ and push up on a cutie
Phone digits I'm stamping
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumping in stereo, people said, ""Here we go,""
A cutie down in front said, ""Heavy you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Loving is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Living on the mike makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you couldn't even hang
We've got our own thang

We've got our own thang
Original, smooth criminal, dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the
Middle

Don't be down with anybody, let them all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought

Stayed beneath my feet before.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,

Heavy Roc,"I've seen suckers loose themselves in the games they learn to play, 
Children love to sing but then their voices slowly fade away. 
People always take a step away from what is true, 
That's why I like you around, 
I want you. 
Yeah you do... you make me want you. 
An open invitation to the dance, 
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in, 
No apology because my urge is genuine, 
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine. 
Here I am and I want to take a hit, 
Of your scent and it bit, 
So deep into my soul, 
I want you. 
You do you do, you make me want you. 
Send me all your vampires, 
And I can't get enough, 
And I can't get enough, 
The village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave, 
The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save, 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes, Deeper than bones, 
I want you, 
And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom, 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek, 
but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep, 
There will be no regrets when the worms come, 
And they will surely come. 
You do you do, I want you, 
Send me all your vampires, 
I want you

I only want you to let it out,

Héber Marques,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

Que nos fazem duvidar

E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

The seeds of time were sown
And watered by 
The deeds of those
Who know 
And who are known

Knowledge is
A deadly friend
If no one 
Sets the rules

The fate of all
Mankind I see
Is in
The hands of fools

The wall
On which the prophets wrote
Is cracking
At the seams

Upon the 
Instrument's object
The sunlight 
Brightly gleams

Where every man
Is torn apart
With nightmares 
And with dreams

Will no one lay 
The laurel wreath
When silence
Drowns the screams

Confusion
Will be my epitaph
As I crawl
This cracked and broken path
If we make it
We can all
Sit back
And laugh

But I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow
I'll be crying

Crying
Crying

Yes I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow
I'll be crying

Hector,"Aurinko laskee, kaupunki hehkuu, tuli taivaan lavistaa
Sinun aurinkosi laskee vaikka maa vain muuttaa siihen suhdettaan 
Nainen on saanut kultaiset renkaat koyhan hintaan ainoaan
Sinun naisesi sua pettaa, vaikka tuskin mahtuu muuhun maailmaan

Kapteeni pelkaa, rykmentin aivo, jarjen esiin-luiskahdus
Ja han alistaa sua Woyzeck vaikka katsot hanta niin kuin tykki kohteeseen
Sulle ihminen on kuilu ja sua pyorryttaa kun katsot syvyyteen

Sun mika nyt on Woyzeck, sotilas

Sun naisesi on kuuma

Pista narttu kuoliaaksi
Antaa menna, antaa menna
Viulut soittaa tiitaa tiitaa
Viulut soittaa tiitaa tiitaa

Halpa on veitsi, leikata leipaa jota syoda saanut et
Podet kuumetta kylmaa
Ota ruutiryyppy paaset sairaalaan
Kuumat on huulet, naisesi huulet
 Kuu jo nousee, punainen 
Niinkuin verinen rauta
Ei kylma ruumis tunne kylmaa ollenkaan

Sun mika nyt on Woyzeck, oi Jumala
Marie on yota vasten kalpea
Mika sinun on, maailma

Hullu lahjoo huoran lasta 
Aina jollain lahjuksella 
Hyva myydaan maailmasta

Aurinko laskee, kaupunki hehkuu, tuli taivaan lavistaa
Sinun aurinkosi laskee vaikka maa vain muuttaa siihen suhdettaan
Maailma sykkii, valtimo villi
Petos johtaa petokseen
Sinun harhasi on totta
Antaa menna, antaa menna, antaa menna uudelleen

Aurinko laskee
Maailma sykkii
Sinut hirteen tuomitaan
Nyt on edessasi kuilu

Hector & Tito,"Uma tigresa de unhas negras e íris cor de mel
Uma mulher, uma beleza que me aconteceu
Esfregando a pele de ouro marrom do seu corpo contra o meu
Me falou que o mal é bom e o bem cruel

Enquanto os pelos dessa deusa tremem ao vento ateu
Ela me conta com certeza tudo o que viveu
Que gostava de política em mil novecentos e sessenta e seis
E hoje dança no frenetic Dancin' Days
Ela me conta que era atriz e trabalhou no Hair
Com alguns homens foi feliz, com outros foi mulher
Que tem muito ódio no coração, que tem dado muito amor
E espalhado muito prazer e muita dor

Mas ela ao mesmo tempo diz que tudo vai mudar
Porque ela vai ser o que quis inventando um lugar
Onde a gente e a natureza feliz
Vivam sempre em comunhão
E a tigresa possa mais do que o leão

As garras da felina me marcaram o coração
Mas as besteiras de menina que ela disse, não
E eu corri pro violão, num lamento, e a manhã nasceu azul
Como é bom poder tocar um instrumento",Tigresa,2002

Dime como debo hacer 
Para arrancarme este deseo 
Que no me deja ni comer 
Y que me da cuando te veo 
Dime como he de negar 
Que te amo y te venero 
Que eres tu mi realidad 
Y mi sueño mas secreto 

Amor, te extiendo mi mano 
Pa' que te olvides de el 
Tu sabes bien que yo te amo 
Y que me lo he callao' muy bien 
No te hagas y conversemos 
Esto hay que aclararlo bien 
Yo no tendre ni un centavo 
Pero soy mas hombre que el 
Yo te conozco de siempre 
Y desde siempre te he adorado 
Yo te conozco mejor que aquellos 
Que hasta te han besado 

Ay, amor 
Dime como debo hacer 
Para arrancarme este deseo 
Que no me deja ni comer 
Y que me da cuando te veo 
Dime como he de negar 
Que te amo y te venero 
Que eres tu mi realidad 
Y mi sueño mas secreto 

Anda, dile que en tu cama 
Mi pasion tu sientes 
Que entre sabanas mojadas 
Te entregas ardiente 
Que yo soy tu unico hombre 
Dicelo a la gente 
Que complazco tus caprichos 
Yo soy diferente 
Que te envuelves con mis labios 
A la hora de amarte 
Que hasta en sueños te me entregas 
Para devorarte 
Y este lujo que mantengo 
No es para comprarte 
Para que quieres tan poco 
Si tienes bastante 

Ay, amor 
Dime como debo hacer 
Para arrancarme este deseo 
Que no me deja ni comer 
Y que me da cuando te veo 
Dime como he de negar 
Que te amo y te venero 
Que eres tu mi realidad 
Y mi sueño mas secreto 

Y tu preguntas por el 
Que es casi como mi hermano 
Cariño, no te ira bien 
Abre los ojos temprano 
Antes que empieze a llover 
Y la nostalgia te haga daño 
Antes que yo me arrepienta 
Y te maldiga suplicando 
Ay amor 
Si por dinero es tu desprecio 
Aveces el amor es necio 
Yo he pagado muy alto el precio 
Manteniendome en silencio 
Dime como he de negar 
Que te amo y te venero 
Que eres tu mi realidad 
Y mi sueño mas secreto 

Son las cosas del amor 
Unos pierden, y otros ganan 
Se llora cuando se ama 
Y uno no es correspondido 
Y el tiempo sera testigo 
De que yo no me equivoco 
Y aunque pienses que estoy loco 
Oye bien lo que te digo 
Te hara cosas con el tiempo que te duelan 
Y esa sera tu condena 
Si el dinero no borra tus penas 
Aqui te espero, mi nena 
En la sala de un hospital 
de una extraña enfermedad mi 
corazon esta muriendo de pena y 
dolor porque no tiene tu amor.",Ay Amor,2006

Cada vez que yo llegue de madrugada
Cada vez que tu por mi te desvelabas
Cada lagrima en tu corazón
Cada boca que bese y no era la tuya

Pero ahora estoy perdido

Me duele cada hueso de extrañarte así

Héctor Acosta,"Aprenderé, a no sufrir cuando un amigo te mencione
A soportar los latigazos de la noche
Cuando el deseo se me cumpla con tu nombre
Y te trate de llamar

Aprenderé,a convivir con los recuerdos sin que duelan
A convencerme d que no vale la pena
Amar a alguien con pasión q no te quiera
Y a pensarte sin llorar

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

Aprenderé a olvidarte, arrancarte de mi piel
Y el corazón
Aprenderé a negarme a mi mismo
Que te quiero como no he querido yo
Aprenderé, a sacar todo
Este amor de mis venas

Aprenderé,cuando te encuentre
A controlar mis emociones, a no escribirte
Ni dedicarte mas canciones a comportarme
Como si yo fuera el hombre
Al que no le duele ya

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

A soportar los latigazos de la noche
Cuando el deseo se me cumpla con tu nombre
Y te trate de llamar

Aprenderé,a convivir con los recuerdos sin que duelan
A convencerme d que no vale la pena
Amar a alguien con pasión q no te quiera
Y a pensarte sin llorar

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

Aprenderé a olvidarte, arrancarte de mi piel
Y el corazón
Aprenderé a negarme a mi mismo
Que te quiero como no he querido yo
Aprenderé, a sacar todo
Este amor de mis venas

Aprenderé,cuando te encuentre
A controlar mis emociones, a no escribirte
Ni dedicarte mas canciones a comportarme
Como si yo fuera el hombre
Al que no le duele ya

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

"Héctor Acosta ""El Torito""","Para llegar a donde estoy
Anduve perdido, recorriendo los caminos
De ansiedad y de dolor
Seco de esperanza de caricias y confianza
Hasta que encontré tu amor.

Para llegar a donde estoy
Tuve que conocerte
Tuve el respaldo de la suerte
Tuve a mi dios siempre presente junto a mi
Para llegar adonde estoy.

Pase por noches que no se merece nadie
Sentí que todos me negaban hasta el aire
Para llegar a ti, para llegar a donde estoy
Llegue a pensar que el mundo me daba la espalda
Que cada puerta que tocaba se cerraba
Para llegar a ti para llegar a donde estoy
Y renacer contigo, y renacer contigo.

Para llegar a donde estoy
Se que fui culpable
Le cause dolor a alguien
Que me dio su corazón
Y como castigo
No volví a sentir cariño

I'll never forget that, where ever I may end up at
The touch of your skin, where do I begin
I can't say enough, bout everything about you that I love
We talked forever about nothing at all

We had the best time, but you were the best part of all
I just missed you that's all, that's all it was
I just loved you that's all, that's all it was
I just wanted you bad, that's all it was

Well I just missed you so much
Well I just missed you so much, so much, so much

I got all your letters that you sent to me
I kept everyone that's all I got to hold on
Remember that time when you were so sad
I'd get you to smile it only took a short while
And then one day, you stopped callin' me

I never knew why, that still almost makes me want to cry
So never again, will I see you

Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas

Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo

Que vera que eres mi consuelo

Aqui en mi barrio Obrero
Me crie en el tiroteo
Me ponia los guantes de niño en el cocoteo
Aprendi que la vida no tan solo es un chisteo
Ahora me la busco bien durote en el perreo
Saludos a todos los cagris que viven del traqueteo
A todos los que estan ready en la zona del fogoneo
Yo se que esta pesada¡, la voz fuera del nebuleo

Que bailen to' los ganster, que se cuiden de los feos
Vamonos algarete, Boster, que esto es malianteo
Si tu gata esta suelta, socio, te la correteo
Mis gatos estan cazando, estan pendiente al nebuleo
Que bailen to' los perros, que se forme un escarseo
Looney, no amares fuego, que se sienta el sopleteo
Me crie en Villa Palmera
A puÃ±o suelto y cambumbeo
De grande aprendi que la vida no es un tripeo
No voy con fantasmeo, ni pero's, ni nebuleos

Hector el Father,"No ha sido fácil acostumbrarme 
Se me ha hecho difícil conformarme 
Con solo amarte en mis sueños 
Soñando que soy tu dueño 
Aun extraño la textura 
De tus labios 
Tu cintura 
Esos ojitos mirándome 
Yo como un loco matándome 


Y en mi cama nadie es como tú 
No he podido encontrar la mujer 
Que dibuje mi cuerpo en cada rincón 
Sin que sobre un pedazo de piel 

Y en mi cama nadie es como tú 
No he podido encontrar la mujer 
Que dibuje mi cuerpo en cada rincón 
Sin que sobre un pedazo de piel 


Me hace daño el hecho 
De no tenerte en mi lecho 
Siento un vacío en el pecho 
Mami me siento deshecho 
Y ahí es que pienso 
En el bonito comienzo 
De este amor que fue intenso 
Si te perdí fue por menzo 
Quede en suspenso 
Los besos que yo te daba 
La forma en que yo te amaba 
Bastante bien te trataba 
Quede en suspenso 
El hecho que fuiste mía 
Me dejas aquí moribundo 
Triste 
Y sin tu compañía 


Y en mi cama nadie es como tú 
(No hay nadie, no hay nadie) 
Que me haga el amor como tu 
(No hay nadie, no hay nadie) 
Que me ericé la piel como tu 
(No hay nadie, no hay nadie) 
Que me haga sentir más que tú

Yo como un loco matándome 


Hoy converso con mi soledad

Le pregunto sabes donde esta

Me contesta que no volverá

Y a mi cama nunca llegara

Cojieron equivoque con el que cantaba trovas
Why ahora los mata why los pasea en el baul de un Nova

Maria Lola vete
Que yo soy perro veinticuatro siete
Recógete
Y mete to’ las fotos en el moquete
Relax
Suave
Acariciarme a pepete
Que esta noche nos fuimos algarete
Te quedate sola
Que ahora yo te bajo alla en la cola
Yo corrí un maratón
Pero yo boté la bola
Tranquila
Que usted no tiene el pecho e tola
Dame una ride
Y te veo Lola

Tanto frio
Cambiar de china por botella
Pero tranquilo por que yo no soy de los que celan
Me veras por allá
Fincando una mas buena

Ay nuestro amor se acabo
Por mi búscate otro hombre
Otro que te vuelva loca
Loca loca vete

Ya tu vez

Todo terminó
Fue una estupidez
Nuestra relación
Yo ya te olvidé
No me llames no
Que no se apure
Que tengo perdon
Y que pasó?

Ahora tengo un pal de ladies
Que me dicen baby

Y aunque tengas otro hombre
Cuanto apuesto
Que el nunca olvidaras mi nombre
Con calmona

Yo sigo en el party botando las suelas
Por que la novela
Es que la parte que tu cuelas
Y yo controlo la manivela
Oye hay que hacer dieta
Te remodelas
Y yo sigo aqui comiendo arroz con habichuelas
Y ya llevo un año sin ella
En el puro jangueo
Ya yo no la veo
Solo ron y bureo

Y si es cuestión de perreo
Perreo dale un paseo
Oye es noche de entierro
Chula siente mi deseo

Hector el Father,"Damas y caballeros! 
Bienvenidos a otro capitulo! 
De la historia del reggaeton! 
Los benjamins! 
Nosotros somos el dream team

Socio, ando con la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de playe'? 
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como jack the ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en bet, trl por mtv, ¡please! 
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday
El pasado, presente y futuro way
Si esto fuera la nba
Fuera dr. J, jordan y lebron james

Abran pasa al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor moreno controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""agua! ""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su brutality
Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, enemy
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, enemy

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero
Papi, yo soy el favorito de los pirateros
Yo soy aquel que te mata
Pa' hablar claro, papi
El favorito de tu gatas de los dones dilato en mi
El mas que suena en las ""scooter"" y las motoritas
(¡Arcángel, pa'!)
(¡No te copies, papi!)

Hoy mi peine caracol se va de gira
Hasta que no tumbe un par pa' atrás no vira
Mi pana, coja la orilla, póngase las zapatillas
Porque hoy vas a correr mas de una milla
(¿Quién es? ) Sube a, gorra a
Cadena crornada con la a
Soy yo, criminal-criminal
Yo no protesto, mucho menos me molesto

Entiéndanme, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que mas adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender

Gatita, te añora tu gato 
Sal por favor que pasan las horas 

Yo solo quiero es que tu me demuestres 
Que eres una muchacha decente 
Y aunque en el brazo llevo tatuajes 
Dice la gente que soy un gangster 
Pero to's mienten 

Loca con que llegue el fin de semana 
Pa' meterle las cabras a tu hermana 
De que vas pal' cine con tu pana 
Un placer tenerte en mi cama 

Nunca madrugas para ir a la escuela 
Siempre me llamas por si el timbre no suena 
Yo dando rondas esperandote afuera 
Y tu te asomas cuando mi cancion suena 

Hay rumores de que te enamoraste 
Y a tus amigas de mi les contaste 
y aunque muchos gente dice que soy gangster 
Nadie podra con este romance 
Hey, 
Mañana avi­same si acaso te demoras 
Yo estare esperandote a la misma hora 
En el colegio donde por la tarde a solas 
Voy a tenerte mia, voy a besuquiarte toa' 
Mañana avisame si algun hombre te incomoda 
Para pillarlo y que sepa que no estas sola 
Yo voy a toa' por ti 
Yo moriri­a por ti 
Yo matari­a por ti 
A cualquier hora 

Habla con tu viejo pa' ver si te escucha 
Aunque te pichee yo sigo en la lucha 

Cuentale que cantas mis canciones en la ducha 
Y que tus emociones son muchas 

Que mi unico pecado fue amarte 
Y ser dueño de todas tus partes 

Suegro, no pichee, usted lo vivio antes 
La nena se va conmigo despues de graduarse

Se cuida su cuerpo comiendo barrita de granola

No como la glotona de Paola

Esta mas fea que un dolor de bola

Y se parece a Patty Manterola

Dime cuanto vas a llorar
Cuanto mas sufrirás por el
Si el no te da amor
Porque aguantarlo mas
Si cada golpe que te da

Otra noche que la paso hablando solo
Un dolor que me acompaña
Contando las horas
De la vida que se va
Como se me fue todo

Porque contigo se me fue el aliento
Porque demonios mi fe está perdida

Loca, loca, vete

¡La diva, la caballota!
Nuestro amor se acabo
Yo celebro cantando
Tu te quedas pensando
Por mi sigue suspirando

¡Hey! solo te queda
Para que aprendas a respetar a esta jeva
Lo que te toka va a aser candela
Para esta reina queda una vela aquí

Ahora no llores
No quiero que me traigas flores
Buena suerte y no se me ahoge
Que esta diva es de las mejores

¿Quién es? El que te pone a vibrar
¿Quién es? El que te pone a pensar
¿Quién es? Al que tú quieres besar
¿Quién es? The one and only, Daddy

Ma', ya tu vez, todo termino
Fue una estupidez nuestra relación
Yo ya te olvide, no me llames, no
Uno se aburre de este novelón

¿Y qué pasó? Ahora tengo un par de ladies
Que me dicen, ""Baby, montame en el Bentley""
¿Y qué pasó? Y aunque tengas otro hombre
Yo te apuesto que nunca olvidaras mi nombre

Con, ""Calmona"", rompo zona
Y voy devorando to' las gatas que veo solas
Me voy de party, llego a mi casa
Ma', a cualquier hora
Vive tu vida, que yo la mía
No la cambio por na' ahora

¿Quién es? El que te pone a vibrar
¿Quién es? El que te pone a pensar
¿Quién es? Al que tú quieres besar
¿Quién es? The boss, Daddy

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores
Corre mala gente

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No quiero que llores por mi
Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores

Corre mala gente
Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No quiero que llores por mi

¡Arcangel pa!
Ella se cree que voy a llorar
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!

Otra mas buena me voy a buscar
Que me ayude mis penas olvidar
Ella se cree que voy a llorar
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!

Otra mas buena me voy a buscar
Que me ayude mis penas olvidar
Gracias a dios estoy mejor
Y poco a poco te olvido

Gracias a dios le doy por salirte de mi camino
La maldad fueron las cosas que me trajo el destino
Y no quiero vivir lo que en el pasado e vivido
Ahora me siento bien porque no estoy contigo

Perdoname Señor si la Maldigo
Pero soy un hombre valiente
Y de temple fuerte de lo unico que me arrepiento
Fue de conocerte

De la guetto le gana enamorando la ganas
Las gorditas las flakas las finas arcangel las sanas
Las que perrean descalzas

Y nunka se cansan
Cuando se trata del amor
Se te unde la tanga
Son los tiempos de antes

El amor no es lo mismo
Los tiempos de carrusel
Los tiempos de los besitos
El amor de colegio, el amor prohibido

Esta vez me presento yo
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!
!Randy!

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores
Corre mala gente

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No quiero que llores por mi
Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores

Corre mala gente
Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No quiero que llores por mi

Maria Lola, vete, que yo soy perro 24/7
Recógete y mete to'a las fotos en los motetes
Relax, suave, acariciame a Petete
Que esta noche nos fuimos algarete

Te quedaste sola
¿Y ahora quién te va a guayar la cola?
Tú has corrido un maratón

Pero yo bote la bola

Hector el Father,"Ella sale sola
Tiene novio pero anda sola
Se pasa cogiendo por la cola
Janguea con Paola

Aunque sabe que ella es bien feola
Esa fea si boto la bola
Viste de Versace pero es de la que rompe consola
Ella fuma pero no pangola

Quiere salir sola
En busca de su Tommy Motola
Pa' ver si termina grabándola
Se cuida su cuerpo comiendo barrita de granola

No como la glotona de Paola
La que es feola
Esta mas fea que un dolor de bola
Me sigue sola

Envuelta en su viaje rola
Ella toma vino y no toma ron con coca cola
Y se parece a Patty Manterola
Tiene un corte latino cintura pequeña y grande cola

Y esta noche va a pasarla sola
Bueno no tan sola
Que jodienda anda con Paola
De pensarlo me duelen las bola

Llegan a la disco y Paola en su viaje rola
Hizo la fila se quedo en la cola
Los gatos la miran ella entra pa' la disco sola

Y en su mente dice ahora es que es

Ya la vieron sola
Y se le pegan por su grande cola
Los buitres anda mirándola
Y busca Paola

Por que se dio cuenta que anda sola
Y es que Paola
Fue pa' Las Gladiolas a capiar rola
Con un rasca bola

Que Paola se encontró en la cola
Y la mangaron monta en un Corolla
Y la amiga sola
Loca por poder guayar la cola

Con un gato que esta velándola
Pero tiene jeva y que casualidad que es de Gladiola
Donde Paola fue a capear la rola
Y llego Paola

A la disco en su viaje rola
Y me vuelven a doler las bola
Y me caso nola
Música pa' que guayen la cola

Pero ella sigue bailando sola
Pero no tan sola
Que jodienda vuelve la Paola
Aunque no baila por que es cocola

Y su novio llama y no sabe que ella se fue sola
Y mucho menos que anda con Paola
Ella le pichea y quieren que le soben la popola
El gato que esta velándola

Y manda Paola
A que le diga al gato que anda sola
Y Paola va y le dice hola

De la historia del reggaeton!
""Los Benjamins""!
Nosotros somos el dream team

Socio, ando con la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡Se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click

Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de Playe'?
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como Jack the Ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en BET, TRL por MTV, ¡please!
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones

Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de Caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""Agua!""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el Cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes OK
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una ""opportunity""
Pues, compárense con mis ""capacity""
Sigan mascando lo que Luny hace, el ""beat""

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero

Yo soy aquel que te mata

soy tristeza y sonrisa pagada
que con dinero se puede obtener
y escuchen por qué
doy placer y de regreso yo no pido nada
si es  trabajo llegar a la fama
y a la fama poder mantener.

No tengo amigos
y si un amor fácil lo consigo
así de fácil lo he de perder

pararás es un sanatorio
y allí fama todo has de perder.

Hector el Father,"Señor, hoy me humillado ante ti
A pedirte por todos mis hermanos
En la calle en especial por Coscú
Señor dale un encuentro contigo
Como lo hiciste conmigo que ellos
Entiendan que tu eres la verdad y la vida
Señor dale entendimiento
Cuídalo de las maquinaciones del diablo
Señor ten misericordia
Envía un bollado de ángeles que lo protejan
En el nombre del padre del hijo
Y del espíritu santo
Amen

Yo respiro el aire que la vida me da y no por el que me quita
La R-15 grita y vas a donde nadie te visita
Mera Father yo estoy harto de escuchar la misma lata
Fulanos quieren meterte, estoy de frente y nunca tratan
Mera hermano yo quiero estar tranquilo cocodrilo
Pero si hablan de matarme en ese flow yo no vacilo
Le doy medio kilo pa' que salga, que los busque
Y te aseguran nunca verte y que de tí ni me preocupe

La vida es una Coscú yo ya tuve fama y fortuna
Y e visto mil sicarios desde que estaba en la cuna
He visto lobos ladrar como dueños de la luna
Pero cae la noche y la muerte nos vacuna
Esto es sencillo cualquiera se presta pa' jalar gatillo
Y la historia termina como la de Alex Trujillo
Que Dios le hablo y le dijo, hijo de la calle corre
O termina muerto como coco el de torre
Coscú abre los ojos que Dios te esta ablando
Tu no te imaginas de lo que te esta librando
Yo siento que el diablo pa ti algo esta tramando
No es lo mismo Coscú que tu tires que te estén tirando

Yo se que tengo la doña también tengo el nene
Pero estos enemigos, unos que van otros que vienen
A mi no me conviene estar así pero al que se revela
Me meten a mi y Héctor quien me va a pagar la escuela?
El nene Coscúlluela yo se que estoy bregando mal
Pero cambiar a estas alturas por tu forma de pensar?
Es como yo dejarlo todo por buscar del nazareno
Sabiendo que después en la calle me va a tirar veneno

La calle te quita la calle na de a devuelto
Tutoño y Sam eran hermanos y están muertos
Coscú la calle te jala Coscú la calle te añoña
Mata al pana tuyo y se te queda con la doña
Abre los ojos que estas ciego Wason despierta cano
Pierdes tus hijos tu familia y al final to eso es en vano
Si no me crees Coscú dale un call al Shako
Pa que te diga que se siente si te matan a un hermano
De sangre y el sufrimiento viene al rato
Y los panas tuyos se te visten de Pilatos
Chico Coscú siéntate que quiero contarte
Que anoche me llamo pito el de juanamaco
Y me dijo brother mio papi esto es infernal
Tengo mil panas y ninguno me han venido a visitar
Que si combo que si chavos, que si guagua con los clavos
Que si uno tiene par de pesos y te sirven 20 rabos
Que si matan que si roncan si te tocan los acabo
Que to quieren se los jefes nadie quiere ser esclavo
Chico Coscú, papi no te envuelvas con la movie
Que la fe de cuando cae justo lloran los mas bravos

En cada pueblo hay un barrio y en cada barrio hay un punto
Y en cada punto se mata y es que de eso se trata papa
Recuerda father que tu te puedes mover
Pero esta calle a ti te hizo y esa si te vio crecer
Hay conciencia me siento a escribir un tema de violencia
Me siento abochorno porque se que si es mala influencia
Te lo juro brother que yo no se no que escribir
Siempre me piden los mismo de matar o de morir
Que si las akas, los kioskos que si se vende y no se fía
Y antes que no era famoso nadie me quería
Nadie me llamaba es mas yo era feo
Ahora es diferente Coscúlluela el del vaqueo
El de las gatas las flacas El de los peines pa' las akas
Yo ya llegue hasta aquí te juro que nadie me saca
Yo estoy bien mi hermano y se le agradece la intención
Y espero que al igual que yo mantengas oración

(Héctor)
(Chico Coscú abre los ojos no entiendes
Que es Dios el que te esta ablando?)

De que te vale tus flacas de que te vale tus akas
De que vale tu punto si tu hueles a difunto
Si cuando mas te ranquean te visitan los del DEA
Cuando te toca la fea de ti se olvida to el mundo
Chico Coscú, no te envuelvas todavía estas a tiempo
Que tu quieres que te maten o te paso como a tempo?
Que inocente lo enceraron y no cometió la falta
Que tenia 100 amigos y que solo 2 le mandan cartas
Mera Coscú yo creía que la calle yo la amaba
Y la vida poco a poco lentamente me quitaba
Hoy estas pegao y mañana to se acaba
Y en la noche yo sentía como el diablo me jalaba
Y me dice ponte los collares y ve donde tu luz
Mata dos gallinas y te saco el retolu
Mera Coscú yo te quiero y te hablo right trae
Esos son demonios que se visten como ángel de luz
Abre los ojos, lee Biblia que eso lo dice Pablo
Coscú estamos con Dios o estamos con el diablo?

Tenia pal de pana, pero ninguno de Cora

Querían las pesetas si les estaba bien si no era un maseta
Quieto tiburón que ya te vi la aleta

Consejos de mi madre no cogí porque era un terco
Gente que ayudó, comenta que yo soy un puerco
Mil beses le dí y una vos que le párese
Me di fama estaban por los pan y por los peses
Ahora se escampan por que escucharon rayos y los truenos
Eran solo víboras llenas de veneno
Yo voy pa' lante por que dios en un culto me dijo
Te quito amigo malos y te pongo amigos buenos

(hay gente que andan contigo y haciendo muerte)
(hay gente que andan contigo y están haciendo trampa se acabo)
(yo ciento aquí la gloria de Dios)
(pero se van a quedar con las ganas)

Héctor se convirtió pa' mí que esta asustado
O lo están buscando o es que esta en barrado
Dios me hablo al oído y dijo me tienen cansado
Hijo anda conmigo ante que mal acompañado
Quizás escuche esto usted se asombre
Pero de cierto Dios no contendrá pa siempre con el hombre

Así que júzgueme y digan que soy un cobarde
Dios dijo que despierte que se me esta haciendo tarde
Que se esta haciendo tarde que no jugara al listo
Que cogiera mi cruz y que siguiera a Jesucristo
Ahora no van a ver lo que mis ojos están viendo
Pero mi gente crean desierto los entiendo
Pues yo queriendo como un siego me encontraba andando
Pero por dentro la casa se me estaba derrumbando

Mi cara reía, mi corazón llorando
Tu me comprende porque a si te encuentras caminando
Mi pastor me dijo que esto se esta acabando
Que ya no hay uno ya son 4 bandos
Madres están llorando niños con pistolas están andando
Y padre que a sus hijas están violando

La gente esta vacía con depresión se siguen suicidando
Vienen tiempo de hambres como esta pasando
La gente le palabra la siguen ignorando
Mi gente abran los ojos el diablo lo esta jalando

Hoy lo digo todo como Cristo en la palabra dijo
Que primero Dios antes que mis padres y mi hijos
Gracias Jehová por pasar de mi esta copa
Por mas que tu tengas con el vacío te topas
Yo como un payaso con mi frente en alto
Y la vida me ganaba asalto por asalto

Muchos que decían yo quiero ser como Héctor
Y yo muriéndome vacío y llorando en mi cuarto
Y clamando y diciendo señor te necesito
Refúgiame o la vida me la quito
Y venia una vos del cielo que decía

Héctor el dinero solo compra momentos bonitos
Yo soy la vida eterna el camino y el sendero
Recapacita que vivimos en tiempo potreros
Imagínate que esta noche yo busca mi iglesia
Tu salvación no la podrás comprar con dinero

Héctor a ti quien diría que la vida te a dado tanto
Antes eras el malo y ahora quieres ser un santo
Diga lo que quieras yo no vengo agradar al hombre
Yo agrado a cristo que con su mano me seco mi llanto

Sigue a cristo a cristo que me hablo y me dijo
Héctor doy promesas de que sanare a tu hijo
Sanare tu hijo pues yo soy verdadero
Sanare a tu hijo lo que no hizo el dinero
Señor porque a mi que siempre te di la espalda
Que preferí la fama el dinero y la falda
Que cuando me moría q a mi me respondiste
Que señor llegaste hasta tiempo tu nunca te tardas
A mi que te falle y me aparte como un canalla

Hijo levántate tranquilo y tu boca calla
Que de los vivos te escogí para avergonzar al hombre
Y serás mi guerrero para la ultima batalla
Pues heme aquí señor te extiendo mi mano
Porque se que la batalla que tendré no será en vano
Aunque me tienten y quieran que yo cambie tu mensaje
A lo bueno diré bueno y a lo malo diré malo

Te crees el terror, controlando todo con balazo
Pero ten cuidado que los amigos están escasos
Te dicen que te aman y te dan un abraso
Y cuando das la espalda te llenan de plomazo

Y tus hijos se quedan solo y no le hacen ni caso
Tu esposa a tu pana, se le entrega en los brazos
Y a tus hijos el nuevo papi los llena´e cantasos

Que cogieras las chamacas y que le hicieras travesuras
Pero en las noches le pedía al Dios de la altura
Señor cuida a mi hija, que se mantenga pura

Y te decía dale pa' lo oscuro pa' que la calientes
Dale calor, pa' que veas como se siente
Pero en las noches, a mi cristo le pedía
Señor cuida a mi hija, que no manifieste

Que pa' los 90 tenia un combo de 70
Tenia 40 pana, y una fama violenta
Ni el combo ni el dinero, el dolor evita
Hoy esta preso y nadie lo visita

Primos que se matan, como Benji y Lelo
Hermanos de crianza, como Black y Raelo
Tu no eres intocable, hoy puedes ser tú
Me acuerdo de mi hermano, Tito Bolondru
La calle te da alas, tu te crees que vuelas
El diablo y la muerte, dándote gabela
Tu das la vida y todo por la calle
Y terminas muerto como Israel 'e Manuela

Que nunca te cojan eso eso es un mito
El diablo te usa, para hacer el delito
Después que te matan nadie te recuerda
Todavía lloro a mi hermano Vito
Como Pichile, Juan de dio, Goldo Pitel y Aleta
La calle te vence, papi aquí no hay metas
No es pa' meterte miedo, es pa' que abras los ojos
Y sepa que en la vida, la muerte no respeta",Payaso,2008
Hector el Father,"Yo que para ti fui hecho
Y tú hecha para mi también
Perdóname
Por buscar tu olor en otra piel
Y porque lo nuestro nunca toco el fracaso

Aún yo siéndote infiel
Perdóname
Por el dolor se que te falle
Y por no estar ahí para secar tu llanto
Que yo mismo provoque

Perdona anda perdóname
Por las veces que sola te deje
Y yo por ahí aferrándome a otros brazos
Perdóname perdóname
Si la vida me permite
Estaré contigo hasta la vejez

Perdóname perdóname
Porque fingí que te olvide
Y me sentí como todo un payaso
Muriendo sin querer
Perdóname

Gracias por que
Aunque me fui tu me esperaste
Gracias por que
Te quedaste en el mismo lugar donde te deje
Gracias por que
Yo jugando a ser un hombre feliz
Y tu en casa velando por mi hijo

Gracias por que
Viviendo en ti y yo no estando ahí
Perdóname
Por dejar que sea franco mi corazón
Pero moría por volver de nuevo a casa

Vez que Dios es fiel
Te prometió traerme de nuevo a casa
Ves que Dios es fiel
Perdóname
Perdóname
Porque lo que Dios unió jamas el hombre podrá separarlo",Perdoname,2008
Hector el Father,"Se nos cae la casa
Si el ser humano pierde el corazón
Se nos cae la casa bro
La vida la quita aquel que la dio
Se nos cae la casa tu casa mi casa esto muerto quedo

Hoy le haces tu mañana pago yo
Se nos cae la casa
Se nos cae la casa

Se nos cae la casa, se nos divide el caserío
Las celda vota sangre y los te canto rompen frio
Ahogaera, mataera y seteria 20 líos
Se nos cae la casa se nos da vuelta el rio
Mataron a fulano por q mengano lo metió en un lio
Mengano salio chota y se llevo el castillo
La calle es trampe el diablo
En nadie yo confió
Mataron a Koquito y nadie sabe un pio

Se nos cae la casa bro
Esto es una pesadilla
En mi Pr el do los casquillo y las camia
Mi hermano de crianza se juto con mantequilla
Esto va pa' atrás la calle es taquetilla
Llego superman el de la babilla
Ha matao' 40 pero a fuerza de pastilla
Le dieron 30 años y le flaquiaron la rodilla
Ahora Superman paso a ser el payaso trompetilla
Superman apesta! y los amigos cogieron la orilla
De tras de los barrotes no te sirve la babilla
Ten cuidao q te tienen pai' en la mirilla
Y en Gonzales lagos se acabaron las capillas

Ahora tienes tolta
Carros caros prenda y cien gatitas
Un combo de 70 tu sabe la bolita
Tienes pal' de panas aunque la vaca esta goldita
Pero cuidao' con judas esta buscando la guirita
Por que tiene miedo pue se comenta que tu no te quita
Comprate la oferta recuerda la sorpresita
Cuando estés en neutro verde y la vaquita este flaquita
¿de las cien gatitas cual de esas te visita?

Hector el Father,"Se cuanto lloras
Se que tu corazón
No siente una razón para vivir y lloras
Cada noche pidiendo Dios mio perdón

Y lloras sin fe
A solas y se
Que cuentas muy poco conmigo
Yo renuevo tu ser

Si haz de mirarme
Al verte solo en el camino
No vivas sin mi,no sufras sin mi
Escucha hijo mio

Si me tocaras
Si tan solo el borde de mi manto
Tocaras
Te sanaría del dolor y del quebranto

Hijo no sabes cuanto
Deseo que vuelvas
No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi

Oh no
Hoy siento que las oras
Se me hacen segundos
Siento que me muero y que se acaba el mundo

Es cierto que e logrado
Un éxito rotundo
Pero por dentro siento que soy un
Vagabundo

Lo he tenido todo
Riquezas y placeres
Buscando ser feliz
He herido a mil mujeres

He tenido todo
Lo que un joven quiere
Pero mi corazón lentamente se muere
Y me pregunto?

De que vale el dinero
Si no puedo comprar un amigo sincero
Si no puedo encontrar
A alguien que me diga
Héctor cuenta conmigo con o sin dinero
Mi mente dice no
Con ella batallo
Quiero servirte pero
Por mi orgullo callo

Camino sin norte
Casi me desmayo
Y me levanto doy tres pasos
Y de nuevo fallo

Levántame no veo la salida
Con mis fuerzas no puedo
Aquí sigue la herida
Muchos que me saltan
Y me llenan el ego

Pero quiero palabras que me llene mi vida
De que valen los lujos?
De que vale la fama
Si cuando cae la noche
Me arrodillo en la cama

Y te clamo y te digo
Señor te necesito
Regresa a mi
O la vida me la quito

Si me tocaras
Si tan solo el borde de mi manto
Tocaras
Te sanaría del dolor y del quebranto
Hijo no sabes cuanto
Deseo que vuelvas

No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi
Ya no
Ya no camines mas sin mi

Hoy Dios te dice
Vuelve a mi
Yo te estoy esperando
En el mismo lugar que me dejaste
Hoy Dios te dice
Ábreme la puerta
Y entrare y cenare contigo
Hoy Dios te dice
Te amo",Si Me Tocaras,2008

A cobra los 40 de to' el caserío
Chamea la pistola pierde treinta ready en el bolsillo 
(En el casa hay guerra)
Y potro ya tu sabe ojo al pillo, 
En el pico tando ronda tenia un par de banchu 
Un par de onda y el que fantasmeaba lo metía 
Pa' la fonda, le decían el Bin Laden
 
Y andaba con un par de loco, sacaba la pory 
Y le bajaba el moco, mezclaba el perico con el choco
El no era un chipichapi, papi de to' el carce 
El era el coco, su socio Belto andaba con la pali 
Bien envuelto por el ronel, pero tenia el deo suelto, 
Ya estaba cansao de trabajar por poca plata,
 potro con los balchu y con los carros 
Y con las gatas, Belto bien pelao aborreció 
Y en las latas siempre amaneciendo 
Sendecando la picata, empezó en su tienda 
Belto monto un kiosco de cinguillo con las cizañas 
Se para el turillo le gustaba la chaucha pero mas 
Le gustaba el gatillo y andaba con un par de loquillo 

La diferencia llevaron a los brothers a matarse, 
Belto quería con los de potro quedarse hubo 
Par de nebula hasta amenazarse, quedo que se cogieran 
Tenían que matarse, la mata se puso mala, 
Belto se creía el mas que jala 
Y la noche se vistió de gala, se puso careta Belto 
Se metió hasta la sala y le dio diez impactos de bala
Señor por favor no me dejes morir Jehová, 
No dejes morir, mi hija, mi esposa, no me dejes morir señor,
 te lo pido ten misericordia ten misericordia 

Tocaste la puerta y nadie salio, tocaste de nuevo y Dios te abrió

Potro salio del hospital, con signos de demencia, 
Ya no tenia pana, ya no tenia conciencia, 
El ambiente tenebroso potro bajando coso y 
Al que fantasmeaba potro lo partía en trozos, pasaron 
Meses largos Belto seguia al calgo y en el caserío 
Aceptaban to' los lalgo, Belto con la gata se dedicó 
A hacer el palgo, potro aborreció estaba loco por cazarlo, 
Decidio el decato, potro se gancho un 44 lo pillo y 
Le metió como cuatro, Belto pa' la paila y potro se quedo
 mandando un rato, lo chocaron en la corte le ofrecieron ciento cuatro

Señor por favor ten misericordia de mi, 
Señor te prometo que esta vez si me ayudas no vuelvo a fallarte, 
Señor por favor ayúdame

Ustedes se preguntaran donde esta potro, 
Potro esta en el corazón de cada uno de nosotros 
Que no hemos sido dignos, de darle las gracias a Dios, 
Después que Dios no ha librado tantas veces de la muerte, 
Pero escrito en la palabra esta, que Dios no va a contender
Para siempre con el hombre, porque de cierto el hombre es carne 
Y Dios es espíritu, ten cuidao que pa' la próxima no te abran la puerta",Tocaste La Puerta,2008
Hector el Father,"Interrumpido queda el sueño por su despertador  
Agotada por la fiesta de la noche anterior  
Con maquillaje todavía, que la hacia ver mejor  
Pero no le trajo amor, hay que dolor  
 
Tantos fines de semanas sin haber podido hallar  
Entre lluvias y tabernas quien la pueda valorar  
Cada vez que llega el lunes tiene que ir a trabajar  
Sin pareja y sin moral, pues no puede captar  
 
Que un hombre interesado en algo puro en algo serio  
No trae hostigamientos, no viene con misterios  
No busca que se embriague, para invadir su dignidad  
Que un hombre interesado en una buena compañera  
No busca en una noche hacer con ella lo que quiera  
No llega seduciendo con palabrerías que no son verdad  
Cargadas de maldad  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer  
 
Cuando cobra la quincena nunca espera para ir  
A la tienda que le ofrezca lo mejor para vestir  
Deseando ya la noche, bien ansiosa por salir  
Desesperada por sentir, alguien que la haga vivir  
 
Un sin numero de discotecas hay para escoger  
Donde busca por un tipo interesado en su querer  
Y aunque abre el corazón para que uno entre en el  
Solo llegan a su piel, pues necesita saber  
 
Que un hombre interesado en algo puro en algo serio  
No trae hostigamientos, no viene con misterios  
No busca que se embriague, para invadir su dignidad  
Que un hombre interesado en una buena compañera  
No busca en una noche hacer con ella lo que quiera
