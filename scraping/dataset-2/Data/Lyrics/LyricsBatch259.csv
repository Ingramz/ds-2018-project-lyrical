Fionn Regan,"Hey rabbit, you've had it
Your fingers are in the coin disposal
Hey, worm, you're tunneling out
You would not listen to their proposal

The springs in the mattress
Will never reveal how I entered
In a hospital ward across a billboard

The girl who collects shells
Has gone back to the coast
Hearing voices in car parks
Pull a diamond from your sleeve

Hey, badger, you're punches out
Your mouth is around an aerosol can
Well, they want you to sink
But you stood up and swam

Ideas are like sparrows
They dart down the hall, the chimney and out of the spout
Down a worm hole and back up my mouth

The girl who collects shells
Has gone back to the coast
Hearing voices in car parks
Pull a diamond from your sleeve

No one these days says thank you
When you open doors for them anymore
Well, I made you rich and you made me poor",Hey Rabbit,2006
Fionn Regan,"They're biting at your heels
Country lanes lead to fields
Who was that fox caught in that trap?
Laid with hunters map

When the cloud rolls back, back, back
I'll meet you at the mill

Depressions in your neck
He's just keeping you in check
Who was that fox caught in that trap?
Laid with hunters map

When the cloud rolls back, back, back
I'll meet you by the mill

You shake hands with lightning
For an apple on a string
You shake hands with lightning
For an apple on a string
",Hunters Map,2006
Fionn Regan,"There's nobody out there, it's just the noise of the wind
There's nobody out there and nobody getting in
I hope that happiness finds its way to your little house

?Cause while you were sleeping
I, I played a ghost in a sheet
When our frames collide
There's nothing left to be

There's nobody out there, the rain is just starting to pour
You get so much there you weary yourself thin
I hope that happiness finds its way to your little house

?Cause while you were sleeping
I, I played a ghost in a sheet
When our frames collide
There's nothing left to be

The skeletal wings of birds, I'll take the stairs
The ghosts of tiny animals with the tiniest of feet
The forecast is going down a storm, a storm
",Noah (Ghost in a Sheet),2006
Fionn Regan,"I apologize, 
Seem to have arrived, 
On what items in my bag from your house. 
There's cutlery, 
A tablecloth, some Hennessy, 
And a book on Presidents deceased. 
I'll have them fed-exed to you, 
It was a strange thing to do, 
I hope we can still be friends. 
Ah, it was not me, 
But someone else, you see, 
Twisting the steering reins. 

Put a penny in the slot and make an 
Artificial li-ii-iight shine, 
Leave go-ooo. Mark old and line. 

I don't give advise, 
But be wise and think twice, 
Before getting involved in a game. 
Where the minority 
Face the majority, 
Who are faceless and born without names. 
Was it knock synch when 
We came across three men, 
They had church candles wrapped in newspaper. 
I bought two from them, 
And I'll lit one for you, 
I hope the message made it's way down the wire. 

Put a penny in the slot and make an 
Artificial li-ii-iight shine, 
Leave go-ooo. Mark old and line. 

The soul of a dog, 
He's alive and not gone 
To the farm like the others said. 
A Rhodesian richback, 
Off the beaten track, 
In a furniture shop down on the quays. 
For the loneliness you foster, 
I suggest Paul Auster, 
A book called Timbuktu. 

Put a penny in the slot and watch the 
Drunken sailor boy dance. 
She will not let you be 
Her lov-ver. 
She goes out looking for 
The taxi. 
Her phone is ringing straight to 
Message-minder. 
Send out a battalion to 
Find her. 

Put a penny in the slot and count the 
Swans through a te-elescope. 
I can't help from cryin' 
I wish you were mine. 

When I was seventeen, 
I followed my dream, 
Up into a high-rise block. 
The adventures of Augie March, 
By Saul Bel-low, 
Was all I had for company. 
At night time I'd lie 
In Beckingham pike, 
With tears like flashbulbs. 
And recall my treasure- 
Searching days, 
In the rock pools as a kid. 

To the remains of 
The cherub plains, 
Or around the bonfire in Nailors? cove. 
Good company and grief 
Sit like a doc leaf, 
Sits beside a singing nett-le. 

Put a penny in the slot and make an 
Artificial li-ii-iight shi-iine, 
Leave go-ooo. My golden arm",Put a Penny in the Slot,2006
Fionn Regan,"We came down by the factory
industrial yards where my father did work
When I was a boy, I went too far
I lost the thread in the darkest of space
If I become antique, you collect me
If I become cheap, then you'll respect me
My jumper is soaked in pig's blood
I'm coming out, looking for you
If you pull a hatchet
I'll pull something to match it
How about your wife?
I will give her a good life
My vehicle is in
your drive
Hey, I'm not that low
The wolves came on the radio
transmitting through a portal
in the snowy atlas mountains
",Snowy Atlas Mountains,2006
Fionn Regan,"The grass is screaming long
Midnight cars roll past
I've been chasing your room
While the summer lasts

So count it on your fingers
If we got it wrong
It's 'cause the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight
Then we leave it all behind

Drinking alphabetically
'Cause the beauty's gone all sore
Honey dripping, paler skin
While there's bodies underneath, the floor

So count it on your fingers
If we got it wrong
It's 'cause the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight
Then we leave it all behind",Abacus,2006
Fionn Regan,"It's getting better all the time 
I used to get mad at my school 
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool 
You're holding me down 
Filling me up with your rules 

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine 

Me used to be angry young man 
Me hiding me head in the sand 
You gave me the word 
I finally heard 
I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better 

I used to be cruel to my woman 
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved 
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene 
And I'm doing the best that I can 

I admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
Yes I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine...",Getting Better,2007
Fionn Regan,"We'll go to knuckle to knuckle, or buckle against buckle,
Your nostrils will flare as you push out the air,
Rise up, Brother,
Rise up from the trappings of flesh and holdings of skin,

We'll steer the car towards the reservoir,
And poison our senses as nightfall commences,
Rise up, Brother,
Rise up from the monotony that is hemming you in,

Tonight while you sleep you'll be grinding your teeth,
Put your head at the North and the South at your feet,
Rise up, Brother,
Rise up from the pack who are baying and clawing for blood,

Oooo-oooo
Who's there?
How can you hear the door,
I'm one-hundred acres of sycamore,
Oh flash my hand past your eyes in the air,
But it won't break your stare,
Is there anyone there,
But the four black winds blowing through the eaves of your mind?

If he darkens your doorway, you come and tell me,
Where he resides, text me or bell me,
Rise up, Sister,
I'll make sure he never darkens your doorway again,

Don't be a stranger to me anymore,
I'll hold a lantern, put your heel on the shore,
Rise up, Sister,
Rise up from the black ships that sail through the swan of your heart,

Oooo-oooo
Who's there?
How can you hear the door,
I'm one-hundred acres of sycamore,
Oh flash my hand past your eyes in the air,
But it won't break your stare,
Is there anyone there,
But the four black winds blowing through the eaves of your mind?

Those weasels in the weeds await to jump us,
One had a screwdriver and one had a cutlass,
We counted the beats between thunder and lightning,
One-thousand and two, one-thousand and three,
It's coming in from the Sea,

Put your hand on my leg,
Kilometres in blue and miles in black,
Lose my eyes in the bathroom,
Arm-wrestle, East, West, place brass-tack,
Bite my lip in the car, midnight ringing,
Unravel on the gravel, phone off, walk,
Search for the lighter in my pocket,
Go inner, and inner, and bolt, and book,
Let the four black winds begone from the eaves of the mind.",100 Acres of Sycamore,2011
Fionn Regan,"Why won't you stay
Don't turn back and walk away
Just listen to what I have to say
We can shelter in this doorway
Bedroom of stars
First day of May

You don't remember the last part
In the taxi you poured out your heart
And your head fell on my shoulder like a willow
There were diamonds laced with sorrow in that pillow
Bedroom of stars
First day of May",1st Day of May,2011
Fionn Regan,"Keep climbing into my head without knockin'
And you fix yourself there like a map pin
On this ghost of this street where I'm livin'
I'm in a chrysalis and I'm snowed in

Darling, darling that dam's gonna give
It's inevitable the way that you live
Bottles in brown paper and a mouth that slurs
All the shit that it stirs
Let that dogwood blossom

There'll be hell to pay in heaven
For you take every street home

What happens when you're into deep to break
Loneliness keeps you constantly awake
What happens when the passage of time appears 
You see yourself as a child and it brings you to tears

You say that you're troubled and you always have been
Uncomfortable in your own skin
So you contemplate the riverbed
Turn off the dark thoughts in your head

Darling, darling that dam's gonna give
It's inevitable the way that you live
Bottles in brown paper and a mouth that slurs
All the shit that it stirs
Let that dogwood blossom

There'll be hell to pay in heaven
For you take every street home",Dogwood Blossom,2011
Fionn Regan,"I would walk you home
And then I sail you to the door
Under white bulbs flashing
Cross the ocean's roar

You're a star
You're a star

I would tell you things
That I told nobody else
Put your arms inside my jacket
KIss me on the steps

You're a star
You're a star
My little heart would beat
When I saw your snow white feet
Eyes of blue, deep and wide
And your hair blows in the
Wind it hurts me darling

Do do do do do
Oh, here it comes
Do do do do do
It's gone in a flash
Do do do do
Fills your lungs
Brings you back to life

As the seasons change
And the nights grew longer still
I'd wait for you in the lane
By your house upon the hill

You're a star
You're a star
My little heart would beat
When I saw your snow white feet
Eyes of blue, deep and wide
And your hair blows in the
Wind it hurts me darling

Do do do do
Well,Here it comes
Do do do do
It's gone in a flash
Do do do do
Fills your lungs
Brings you back to life

I love you and I always will love you
I love you and I always will

Fionn Regan,"The horses are asleep with heavy eyes that close.
In dreams they trace the path by which the river flows.
Let spirit now align with the estuary.
As nightfall's open mouth howls out to the sea.

It starts with a kick then, hips align vertically. 
Muscle and bone assemble.
The carriage of her arms breaks free.
I douse this bullrush with petrol from a can.
And into the forest with it lit I ran.
I'm a man. 
I'm a man. 
I'm a man, with a child's heart

The horses are asleep, the stable door will lock.
Count the hours you keep on a ballerina clock.
Let spirit now align the current of the breeze. 
As nightfall's open mouth howls out through the trees. 

It starts with a kick then, hips align vertically. 
Muscle and bone, assemble
The carriage of her arms breaks free.
I douse this bullrush with petrol from a can.
And into the forest with it lit I ran.
I'm a man. 
I'm a man. 
I'm a man, with a child's heart",The Horses Are Asleep,2011
Fionn Regan,"Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Are a north star, burning.

She shifts her weight to the other foot,
Asks me how deep I'd like the cut,
Sharpening her words.

He kicks out the door wedge,
And walks her to the ledge,
Points out to the ocean.

I hear that you're living in, that house out by the lake.
Things that fall together, just as easily break.
I'm not looking back though.

Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Are a north star, burning.

Ah, ah
Ah, ah

We wrestle with the tide,
Till there was nowhere to hide,
Laid bare on the rocks.

Things came into focus sharp,
With the morning came a spark,
That lit the fuse for sorrow.

I hear that you're living in, that house out by the lake
Somewhere down the road, beside you I wish to wake,
I'm not looking back though.

Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover, you are,
Are a north star, lover.

Lay your head, on the river bed.
The tears we shed, gonna burst the bank.

Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Are a north star, turning.

Fionn Regan,"You pulled a rainbow from my skull and you said “look at that” 
The fire you have within will never dim its climb
I will always run to you run to you upon the ground 
On hollow bones 

Cormorant bird does not sing things
For days 

The cloud pulled its curtain but the light stayed where you sat 
In the blackberry bush where the bulbs
Shatter white

Back to the years of loo-li lai-lay

With diamonds and pearls at your head and your feet

Lights up your face in orange and gold
I see your sweet smile shine through the darkness
It's line is etched in my memory, so I'd know you by heart

Mornings in April, sharing our secrets
We'd walk until the morning was gone
We were like children, laughing for hours
The joy you gave me lives on and on 'cause I know you by heart

I still hear your voice on warm summer nights
Whispering like the wind

You left in autumn, the leaves were turning
I walked down roads of orange and gold
I saw your sweet smile, I heard your laughter
You're still beside me everyday 'cause I know you by heart

E' un fuoco e tu lo sai
Il pensiero che mi dai
Ma il cuore che c'è in lui lo sai
E il mare che vorrei

E poi, per quanto resterai
Facile e' facile

So che volerei

che pericolo la quotidianitÃ

Dove sei, come vivi dentro? 
C'e' sempre sentimento 
nel tuo parlare piano 
e nella tua mano 
c'e' la voglia di tenere

Io conosco la mia vita e ho visto il mare
E ho visto l'amore da poterne parlare

Che e' già un ritorno

E senza confronto
Che conosci la tua vita 
Ma non hai visto il mare
E non hai l'amore per poterne parlare

E se questa e' una canzone 
Con cui davvero si puo' parlare
In questa sera ferita 
Da non lasciarsi andare
In questa notte da soli 
Che non ci si puo' vedere
E non ci si puo' contare 
Ma solo ricordare
Io conosco la mia vita e ho visto il mare
E ho visto l'amore vicino da poterlo toccare
Ma nelle notti di maggio

La stagione dell'amore viene e va, 
all'improvviso senza accorgerti, la vivrai, ti sorprenderà. 
Ne abbiamo avute di occasioni 
perdendole; non rimpiangerle, non rimpiangerle mai. 
Ancora un'altro entusiasmo ti farà pulsare il cuore. 
Nuove possibilità per conoscersi

Scappa dalle serrande 
E cerco invano qualcosa 
Da inventare in mutande 
Un'automobile passa 
E una mosca vola bassa 
Mi ronza gira gira 
Ma sbaglio la mira 
Vorrei cercare qualche cosa 
Da fare fuori 
E camminare senza orgoglio 
Darsi a un rubacuori

So vendermi nuda

Attirarti nel bosco attirarti 
Voci di strada all'orecchio 
Tutto è poco eccitante

Da questa casa galera 
Che mi fa prigioniera 
Con gli occhi chiusi 

A mille miglia per conto mio

Sono tante 
Un ballo in cucina 
E sono ancora bambina

ad aspettare che qualcosa voli 
A indovinare il viso di qualcuno che ti passa accanto 
Tornare indietro un anno, un giorno
per vedere se per caso c'era 
E sentire in fondo al cuore 
Un suono di cemento 
Mentre ho già cambiato uomo un'altra volta 
Come si cambia per non morire 
Come si cambia per amore 
Come si cambia per non soffrire 
Come si cambia per ricominciare 

Con gli occhi verdi e brillantina 
Sento il duemila certo che verrà 
Agile la pioggia sopra le mie spalle nude 
E dentro un taxi nella notte 
avere freddo e non sapere dove 
Sopra un letto di bottiglie rotte strapazzarsi il cuore 
E giocare a innamorarsi come prima 
Come si cambia per non morire
Come si cambia per amore 
Come si cambia per non soffrire 
Come si cambia per ricominciare 

Quante luci dentro ho già spento 
Quante volte gli occhi hanno pianto 
Quante mie incertezze ho già perso, oh no
Come si cambia per non morire
Come si cambia
Sentire il soffio della vita 
Su questo letto che fra poco vola 
Toccarti il cuore con le dita e non aver paura 
Di capire che domani è un altro giorno

Come si cambia per amore 
Come si cambia per non soffrire 
Come si cambia per ricominciare

Sally è una donna che non ha più voglia, di fare la guerra
Sally ha patito troppo,
Sally ha già visto che cosa, ti può crollare addosso!
Sally è già stata punita
Per ogni sua distrazione o debolezza
Per ogni candida carezza
Data per non sentire l'amarezza!

Senti che fuori piove
Senti che bel rumore.
Sally cammina per la strada sicura
Senza pensare a niente
Ormai guarda la gente con aria indifferente.
Sono lontani quei momenti
Quando uno sguardo provocava turbamenti
Quando la vita era più facile
E si potevano mangiare anche le fragole
Perché la vita è un brivido che vola via
È tutto un equilibrio sopra la follia
Sopra la follia!

Senti che fuori piove, senti che bel rumore.
Ma forse Sally è proprio questo il senso, il senso del tuo vagare
Forse davvero ci si deve sentire alla fine un po' male!
Forse alla fine di questa triste storia qualcuno troverà il coraggio
Per affrontare i sensi di colpa e cancellarli da questo viaggio
Per vivere davvero ogni momento
Con ogni suo turbamento e come se fosse l'ultimo!

Ormai è sera
Si accendono le luci dei lampioni
Tutta la gente corre a casa, corre davanti alle televisioni.

Forse qualcosa si è salvato
Forse davvero non è stato tutto sbagliato
Forse era giusto così

Fiorella Mannoia,"Due note e il ritornello 
era già nella pelle di quei due
il corpo di lei madava vampate africane, 
lui sembrava un coccodrillo
i saxes spingevano a fondo 
come ciclisti gregari in fuga
e la canzone andava avanti sempre più affondata nell'aria
quei due continuavano, 
da lei saliva afrore di coloniali

che giungevano a lui come da una di quelle drogherie di una volta
che tenevano la porta aperta davanti alla primavera
qualcuno nei paraggi cominciava a starnutire,
il vantilatore ronzava immenso dal soffitto esausto,
i saxes, ipnotizzati dai movimenti di lei si spandevano
rumori di gomma e di vernice, da lui di cuoio

le luci saettavano sul volto pechinese della cassiera
che fumava al mentolo, altri sternutivano senza malizia
e la canzone andava elegante, l'orchestra era partita, decollava
i musicisti, un tutt'uno col soffitto e il pavimento,
solo il batterista nell'ombra guardava con sguardi cattivi

quei due danzavano bravi, una nuova cassiera sostituiva la prima,
questa qui aveva gli occhi da lupa e masticava caramelle alascane,
quella musica continuava, era una canzone che diceva e non diceva,
l'orchestra si dondolava come un palmizio davanti a un mare venerato
quei due sapevano a memoria dove volevano arrivare

un quinto personaggio esitò
prima di sternutire,
poi si rifugiò nel nulla
era un mondo adulto,
si sbagliava da professionisti",Boogie,2004

O ci si diventa

Per cui gli inviti adesso falli tu.

Un tempo distante che è roba degli altri
Un momento che era meglio partire
E quella volta che noi due era meglio parlarci.

E saper raccontare ai nostri bambini quando
È l'ora muta delle fate.

Non essere gelosa di me
Non essere mai gelosa di me.

E quello dopo perduto via

Che arriva alla volta celeste

Si tende la mano
È il medesimo istante per tutti

Ama, non la tradire 
Non frenare l'allegria 
Non tenerla tra le dita 
Ricorda che l'ironia ti salverà la vita 
Ti salverà

Ed io ti penserò in silenzio 
Nelle notti d'estate 
Nell'ora del tramonto 
Quella muta delle fate 
E parlerò al mio cuore 
Perchè, domani partirai 
In silenzio 
Ma in una notte d'estate 
Io ti verrò a cercare 
Io ti verrò a parlare 
E griderò al mio cuore 
Perché tu lo possa sentire 
Sì, lo possa sentire 
Tu lo possa sentirte",In Viaggio,2012
Fiorella Mannoia,"Ci penso da lontano da un altro mare un'altra casa che non sai 
La chiamano speranza ma a volte è un modo per dire illusione 
Ci penso da lontano e ogni volta è come avvicinarti un po' 
Per chi ha l' anima tagliata l'amore è sangue, futuro e coraggio 

A volte sogni di navigare su campi di grano 
E nei ritorni quella bellezza resta in una mano 
E adesso che non rispondi fa più rumore nel silenzio il tuo pensiero 
E tu da li mi sentirai se grido 
Io non ho paura 
Il tempo non ti aspetta 

Ferisce questa terra dolce e diffidente 
Ed ho imparato a comprendere l'indifferenza 
Che ti cammina accanto 
Ma le ho riconosciute in tanti occhi le mie stesse paure 
Ed aspettare è quel segreto che vorrei insegnarti 
Matura il frutto e il tuo dolore non farà più male e adesso alza lo sguardo 
Difendi con l'amore il tuo passato 
Ed io da qui ti sentirò vicino 
Io non ho paura 

E poi lasciarti da lontano rinunciare 
Anche ad amare come se l'amore fosse clandestino 
Fermare gli occhi un istante e poi sparare in mezzo al cielo il tuo destino 
Per ogni sogno calpestato ogni volta 
Che hai creduto in quel sudore che ora bagna la tua schiena 
Abbraccia questo vento e sentirai che il mio respiro è più sereno 

Io non ho paura 
Di quello che non so capire 
Io non ho paura 
Di quello che non puoi vedere 
Io non ho paura 
Di quello che non so spiegare 
Di quello che ci cambierà",Io Non Ho Paura,2012
Fiorella Mannoia,"Sono più di cent'anni che al parco della luna
Arriva Sonni Boi con I cavalli di legno
E la sua donna Fortuna
I denti di ferro e gli occhi neri puntati
Nel cielo per capirne I misteri.
È nato a Ferrara anzi l'hanno trovato su un muro
È pieno di segni e I muscoli
Corrono sulla sua pelle.

Sonni Boi ha disegnato sulle braccia
La mappa delle stelle.
Di notte va a caccia e con il cavallo
Raccoglie chi si è perduto
Anch'io quante volte da bambino ho chiesto aiuto
Quante volte da solo mi sono perduto
Quante volte ho pianto e sono caduto
Guardando le stelle ho chiesto di capire
Come entrare nel mondo dei grandi
Senza paura paura di morire
Come uno zingaro seduto su un muro
Gli occhi nel cielo puntati sul futuro

Dei suoi mille figli non ricorda un viso
Ne ha avuto uno per coltello
Ha fatto un figlio per ogni nemico ucciso.
Sonni Boi non è cattivo ha perfino sorriso guardando
Fortuna accarezzandole il viso.
Li ho visti abbracciarsi come bimbi nel parco della luna
Tutti e due con una valigia nella mano
Con l'aria di chi deve partire
E andare lontano oppure morire,
In silenzio, sparire piano piano
Sopra il loro cavallo di legno con
La loro pelle scura nella mano

Adesso Sonni Boi e la sua donna Fortuna
Saranno a metà strada tra Ferrara e la luna",Il  parco della luna,2013

Oggi è un giorno in bianco e nero, pioverà
Cerco malinconico nel tempo
Qualche sogno che ho fatto già anni fa!
Il gelo ha disegnato sopra I vetri fiori blu
E c'è una nuvoletta che discende di lassù.
Si apre in due metà qui di fronte a me!

Quanti bei colori in quella nuvola
E quanta gente allegra
Sopra un leone c'è
Un bimbo che invita anche me
A cavalcare tutti gli animali
Che san parlare come noi
E ridendo han ragione di pensare
Che le bestie siamo noi

Là nei prati azzurri galoppando
Sui cavalli bianchi e neri, giocherò.
Sulle grandi ali colorate
Di bellissime farfalle, volerò.
Seguendo le formiche
In fila indiana marcerò,
Poi ruberò il violino alla cicala e suonerò
E chi mi ascolterà canterà con me

Quanti bei colori in quella nuvola
E quanta gente allegra

Dell’uomo reso libero ma schiavo del profitto

Oltre le apparenze in eterno movimento
Tra quello che vorremmo e quello che dobbiamo
Con l’anima in conflitto per quello che non siamo

Aspettano in silenzio le belle giornate
E un lampo di coraggio per tornare in superficie

Fire From the Gods,"Look what I’ve found, come get down
It’s that revolution sound
Call it second emancipation, break these chains and let me out
It’s not violence I’m on about, but riot boots still hit the ground
Lower the gun put down the whip
Take a step back hear me out
I am fanatic, employ guerilla tactics
Open up this lyrical automatic and put holes in your rhetoric
It’s archaic, kind of chaotic, almost barbaric
But yet you stand and you swear by it
And I’ve been readily, steadily waiting for a chance to resist
The devil is a liar, topple the empire
Blood sweat tears and desire
I put my heart into this
Never forget I’m a soldier
I will not be conquered

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, equality and justice for all
Now you know you lying

You on that shotgun philosophy, celebrate the tragedy
Build an effigy high to the heavens to remind me and blind me
Turn the whole world into my enemy
Control my destiny and drain all my energy
It’s insane to me
Got the whole nation sedated and medicated
A testimony to the violence
Yet you still give me that ghetto education
Basically priming me to feed me to the prison industry
I see all of the cowards, the greed, the need to hold control over me
Break these chains, end the power
I’d rather you give back what you stole from me

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Excuse me Mister officer, come out of my sector
No need to stress, no need for vex

Ah, ah, ey
Yo, excuse me your honor, fuck the drama
No apologies, I save that for my mama
Take my name off of the docket
Drop all these charges
All it took was a spark, all it took was a catalyst
Martin said it best, I live a life with no violence
So I speak up, no longer silent
I begin to see
My third eye is opening
And my resolve is strengthening
I yearn to be free

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Excuse me Mister officer no need for war
Trying to drain my energy, but you can’t keep me down

I, I, I, I, I, I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, but it won’t kill me",Excuse Me,2016

And we are driving in the fast lane

Fire Inc.,"Lying in your bed and on a Saturday night
You're sweatin' buckets and it's not even hot
But your brain has got the message
And it's sending it out
To every nerve and every muscle you've got

You've got so many dreams
That you don't know where to put 'em
So you'd better turn a few of 'em loose
Your body's got a feeling that it's starting to rust
You'd better rev it up and put it to use

And I don't know how I ever thought that I could make it all alone
When you only make it better
And it better be tonight
And we'll fly away on those angel wings of chrome in your daddy's car
Waiting there for you tonight
I'll be there for you tonight

Even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And your speed
Is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know
Darlin', darlin'

You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly
And we've gotta get away from the past
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast

Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast

Ah
Stalkin' in the shadows by the light of the moon
It's like a prison and the night is a cell
Goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven tonight
'Cause stayin' here has gotta be hell
Dyin' in the city like a fire on the water
Let's go runnin' on the back of the wind
There's gotta' be some action on the face of the earth
And I've gotta see your face once again

And I don' know where I ever got the bright idea that I was cool
So alone and independent
But I'm depending on you now
And you'll always be the only thing that I just can't be without
And I'm out for you tonight
I'm comin' out for you tonight

Enchanted by the edge of a lake

And the earth below him's starting to shake

I don't hear any holy choirs sing
And if I can't get an angel
I can still get a boy
And a boy'd be the next best thing

A boy'd be the next best thing

I've got a dream 'bout a boy in a castle
And he's dancing like a cat on the stairs
He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
And the thunder of a drum in his ears
I've got a dream 'bout a boy on a star
Looking down upon the realm of the world
He's there all alone and dreaming of someone like me

Better walk don't talk she's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall after all
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch

Cause she thinks she's so'phisticated

Peekin', seekin' inside a book
Her demands for a man with a chemical look
Wishes, desires, gettin worse with age
She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club
She think it's classy but it's really a pub
But that's the kind of place she likes to go
The bitch got a problem

Cause she thinks she's so'phisticated

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang
Talk like this, don't talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and play it off
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl, stone cold freak
Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms
Never kept a name, never seen a face
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place
I know she's a ho I'm on the go
Expose the funky bitch

Cause she thinks she's so'phisticated

Now she wants a sucker but with an attache
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away
You can smile with stile but you lost your trial
Cause you got a gold tooth, she thinks you're wild
She don't want a brother that's true and black
If you're light, you're alright, better stay back
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch
With something in his bag keepin' her attached
The man's got a plan, it's IBM
The devil at her level, yes it's him
His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes
The ill base method, turning up her nose
Lack a lack a lack, now beaming her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble

Cause she was so'phisticated

Little is known about her past
So listen to me cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
And never got caught, so the story goes
She kept doin' that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
He didn't beat the bitch down till she almost died

Should've known it would go bad, right from the start
What did I do wrong?

I can't understand why she would leave me this way

Then I found the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever

Should've know all along that she just didn't care
Why did she have to go?

She left me this way...-Why did she say goodbye?

Running like a child from these warm stars

I'm in Love This Time by Firehouse

Who makes it always happen who makes it always so worthwhile
Who is the one who makes my motor run
You know it's you honey I'm in love this time
I'm in love this time
I've been around a time or two
I've seen it all except for you
I'm feelin' kind a funny and I don't know why
But I couldn't ever see you with another guy
And you're not just an ordinary woman
And it ain't like I'm no ordinary man
'Cause you make me feel so good inside
I can't get you outside of my mind
No one's ever felt so right
You're the only one and don't I know
Who makes it always happen who makes it always so worthwhile
Who is the one who makes my motor run
You know it' you honey I'm in love this time
I'm in love this time

You keep me satisfied and give me so much more

Don't hide your body underneath those fancy clothes
I want you to let it all hang out
And when I see you shake it makes me want to shout
Take it off
So take 'em down and hit the lights
Show me that you've got nothing to hide
I don't mean any disrespect you've got sex appeal
I just can't control the way you make me feel

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.

It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues [*],2012

Firewind,"Just a Steel-Town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees that at all
They all say she's crazy

Lockin' rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-filled line of sanity
It's a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
You touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays alive

There's a cold, cold native heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her hair
Against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
'Cause she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac
Dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor

At the airport terminal
At nine in the evening
I was sitting crying to you over the phone
Well passing the border from a state to another
Filled with people whom I couldn't help to relate to
And we stopped a while at a roadside restaurant
Where the waitress was sitting outside smoking in her car
She had that look of total fear in her eyes
And as we drove away from there she looked at me and
She smiled

And my feet are in the sky

I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

And once you asked me well what's my biggest fear
That things would always remain so unclear
That one day I'd wake up all alone
With a big family and emptiness deep in my bones
That I would be so blinded, turn a deaf ear
And that my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere

Now I wasn't born for anything
Wasn't born to say anything
Oh I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone

While I sleep they start dimming the lights

Screaming ""Fire!"" in a theater people taking their seats
Watch it all go down like a stone in a stream

First Blood,"They drew first blood, not fucking me 
The institutions that try to decide how I should live my life 
With their traditions they expect me to fall in line, 
But their will, their way is not for me 
Anyone thinking with an open mind is often ostracized 
So my decision just to stay within my own kind is justified
 
They drew first blood, it wasn't me
 
I didn't ask for all these things 
To be part of this world or part of me 
And who are they to protest me 
When all I want is to live peacefully 
Just leave me be 

Born in this world with innocent eyes 
The more I see it becomes more clear to me 
I cannot trust powers that be 
Taught to embrace with open arms a society 
That does not have a place for me 
I didn't ask for this social divide 
And all the racists and the scum of mankind 

But now I know, 
I'm on my own, so leave me be, 
And I'll live my own life 
This is the way things have to be 
All because they drew, they drew first blood, 
As corporations gain control of the world, 
The more and more the common good is not served 

They won't dictate or brainwash me 
To buy their dreams and consume 'til I die 
The best advice given to me is 
Never serve who is not there to serve me

First Blood,"Conditioned to live life in constant servitude
Never questioning another way of living life
'Cause what I gave you I didn't get back in return
For my time spent building their dreams
'Til I was left with nothing

Spending each waking moment
Waiting for my days to end
A slave to the man
Will someone just save me from this regimen

Forcing myself to do something in absolute compromise
I'm stuck in a rut
Will someone just save me from this torture
From the life that I truly seek

I have to take a chance and live in risk
'Cause these chances are just passing by
Pieces of my soul being to face
Will someone just take me away
From this modern slavery

Just so high someone can climb
Yet still they fall behind
And when it's gone they treat it like it's the end of the world
The end of your world

I can't let life pass me by
Save me from this regimen now

This never ending cycle constantly creates me 
This cycle; it will never end

Pick me up, then bring me down, just like the turning of the tides 
Bring me hope, then hopelessness, just like the turning of the tides...

Now I ain't sayin that's gon' stop all my niggaz that chop
Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest

We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

Cock back my grill, let 'em know this burner's for real
When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occasion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody

Whispering you can never change
The broken part where hope has died

Condemns you
God is greater than your heart

From the fear that you're failing Him
Beyond the lies, your God is true

And He won't condemn
There's a voice from your Father's heart
He affirms who you really are

Greater and even if your heart
Condemns you

(I've been waiting)
Waiting for Your sweet love

If I count the ways
You've carried me this far
Might as well try counting
Each and every star

Once again I find
I've given You my heart
And I'm waiting for Your love

Abba, Father
Purest lover of my soul
How I need this
Love that will not let me go

Whisper to my spirit
Just tell me You are near
Oh, I just need Your sweet love
To fall upon me here
I need Your sweet, sweet love

First Class,"Do you remember back in old L.A. (Wo-oh-oh)
When everybody drove a Chevrolet (Wo-oh-oh)
Whatever happened to the boy next door,
Suntanned, crewcut, all-American Male?

Remember dancing at the high school hop
The dress I ruined with the soda pop?
I barely recognized the girl next door
With beatup sneakers and a pony tail

CHORUS:
Beach Baby, Beach Baby, give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight.

Beach Baby, Beach Baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day.

Oooh. I never thought that it would end
Oooh. And I was everybody's friend
Long hot days, Blue sea haze
Juke box plays, but now it's fading away.

We could'nt wait for graduation day
We took my car and drove to San Jose
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything!

First Communion Afterparty,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

And just when they thought 
That everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, 
the culprit of fear on the 67th tear
There lies, the boogie man.

No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind trying just to lead it
I'm N9ne, who supposed to be this rough MC
Who's glutton-ny would rhyme grime,
Trust believe it
A legend ever since the projects
Odd tech would get respect when he wreck the set
But never get the props that was god blessed
So this is me, never let the prod rest
The object of rawness inject your steps to darkness
Led the industry to whispering the name
History became a mystery
'cause listeners in the game
Wish to sing the same
Which cerebral glitch will lead to lane
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face to it, 
Oh what a shame

And when he stands still, he turn to lanes
From sane to straight wicked, don't tell me you ain't heard the saying

Tries 'n' blind you,
From that boogieman.

'Eliminate your fears'

Discover the truth
That is The Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that Boogieman

They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's prolly why it ain't been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and mics they by-Flew,
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin, haven lies you
'cause you don't want change
And you don't want strange,
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fames strange
And you can maintain
you think you sang such an insane rain, same thing
And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin' in the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
That give a rattle to their hearts
'Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The boogieman is not a tall tail

Wat a tough act to follow
you afraid? tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane sayonara

First Degree the D.E.,"[Lynch]
The only one who ever saw my face, I must erase, had to get filthy dirty
Left him in his driveway soaking wet, hope nobody heard me
I'm out that muthafucka with about 4 pounds of that shamrock
Zip lock, body bag, toe tag, wet t-shirt, black mask
In and out fast, murderous, vast vigorous
Stroke that nigga like a zig zag rolled cigarette,
And I do it to get my dick wet
Brain grain rotten, I was a 12 year old gettin' raped by my momma's partner
So I've been in pussy since I could start nuttin'
I'm off that cloraseptic and that robatussin
Had a appetite for the wrong nigga, said he was real meat but I knew he wasn't
Had me dumpin' out the back of cadillac's on walter
Got a stinky smell to him, can't even hug my momma
I'm so sick I can't sleep at night, might swallow my tongue
Get all the gas deposits out the closet, let the water run
Get the flame thrower, lighter fluid, paper plates, 'cause we barbacuin'
In a funky situation that's how we do it

[Chorus]
Situation, baby it seems I'm in a situation again
I fuckin' realize it's a situation of sin
Sometimes I just want to stop tryin'
Why must this shit always involve dying?

[E-40]
Runnin' shit like sosza, big bank hank
Smebbin' in a high performance zooped up nova, pushin' crank
Callin' shots on my gossipper, faulty chip
1-800 locker number, on the left side of my hip
Neighborhood watch better watch that ass
I'm a paperboy and I collects that cash
One more muthafuckin' complaint and your ass ain't gon' last
On a block where I clock cash so fast
This is a stick up, nigga, don't even try it
If you go as far as to blink an eye, muthafucka you gon' die
Pressure I apply, no lie, I got just finished doin' 10
For what? for killin' my best friend
And I'll murder again if I'm forced, then I must
After the first time the second time was a rush
What about the third time? the third time felt like sex
What kind of guns did you use? choppers, uzis, teks
Whatever one works best
I'll make a mess upon shooting flesh, 'bout 15 holes in his chest
Vandalism, taggin' all muthafuckas names on the wall
Scandalism, dyin' over all kinds of senseless shit that's small
Auto theft, stealin' cars for fun
Snatchin' purses 'cause I'm young and dumb
If you a tourist check yo' map, don't make the wrong turn
Might end up in the hood where you gon' be learnin'

[Chorus]

[First degree]
Rock it, don't stop it, rock it, don't stop
I got this dirty hemp distributin' my womp
But if it was up to her, fool we'd be fuckin' like beavers
But I'm an over achiever around these heaters
I don't need a bitch, society done fucked up and cheated that bitch
Now she lookin' for a nigga like me to feed her and shit
Dumb bitch better quit, that muthafucka first degree keep a leash on his dick
Take notes, sit by the poor folks, I tell you 'bout my strokes
But I done been gave that up, ain't healthy no more
'cause a this yappin' and feelin', she strapped with the homies
And her weak mind got all of Sacramento in a bind
Lizzy ann must die, the situation just ain't right
'cause she got to bumpin' her gums like her momma, so I called her
I said I got mines, get off your ass and raise your daughter

[Twamp dog]
Peniles at my door, three in the front, nigga, four through the back
Talkin' bout takin' me down to the sac town county jail,
Strapped up 'cause I did a jack
Armed and dangerous, waited 6 months to come and get me
Knowin' I'm into straps, 'cause every time I get caught one was sittin' with me
2 time before this, now add one more to the program quick
Shackled down, now I'm on a mission to a one man cell with the quickness
Think about the work that I did that night and what went wrong,
To get a rider caught
30g bail cost to get me off, fightin' on the street, fuckin' watched
Every 2 weeks another court date, thinkin' I can win, that's no lie
Kept on goin' on for some months, lookin' the judge right in the eyes
Feelin' his anger,
Watched fools before me do petty crimes and he's givin' 'em time
Bein' a bitch about muggin' on me, nigga talkin' shit to me, heated like
Pointing guns at individuals, huh, I despise muthafuckas like you
So it ain't no love for me judgin' you, watcha gon' do?
Take it to another court room?
And that's the first step for me, my lawyer knew the d.a.
You know, so he tried to hook a brother up, you see
If I did take a deal, it's only one year guaranteed
But I'm bout to give work for dough in a couple more weeks
Tryin' to give 10 years, if I go to trial and lose the muthafucka
Then I messed around and had to go back to the first judge,
Sayin' don't work for ya
I wasn't gettin' off that easy, my case had a little substance
And the odds are stacked against me, no frontin'
Choices need to be made on the 7th
A catch 22 in my midst, 'cause either way I'm fucked
Go to trial where I'll probably lose, or take my ass on the run
Or take a deal to a lesser charge, either one I'm gettin' struck
'cause doin' time is a mando thang and that got a muthafucka stuck

A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,

But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear,

You loved me

Make me feel
So loved, so complete

That I can dream of
The one solution to every problem

The last time we touched, the last time you held me

The last time we missed, and I could see you clearly
My eyes were not opened up
The last time we missed, the last time I held you
I could see you clearly

Your sky is mine, I walk beneath it
Not alone
When I call your name
You always answer

And every time I begin to doubt you
You give me more love
No hesitation
You come to me when my heart is beating
So hard I cannot breathe

You give me all I need

And this is all I need
The last time we touched, the last time you held me
My eyes were not opened up
The last time we missed, the last time I held you
I could see you clearly

A heart on the mend is one that I can't get used to

And I didn't need to hear I'd known the wrong you
I don't believe a single thing you do

So I go up along the rooftops
I hear the dog bark but I'm not coming down
So when are you going to quit?
I know this can't be good for me

Beyond the lonely lines there is a place that suits me well
But it doesn't feel quite right
Because there is someone I can't tell
Who means the world to me

And though it's only been two weeks
I'm feeling life again, I'm feeling okay
I swear I saw you yesterday
It hasn't been a whole night and a day

When I go up along the rooftops
I'm coming down but only when you're here
So wait up, I'm throwing up
I know there's something wrong with me

So when the week ends
I'll be where your revival starts
And mine will end

",Revival (Starts and Ends),2007
First to Leave,"I see you reaching over ghost town walls
And I'll tell you what I'd do if I were you
I would tunnel underground without making a sound
To find a place where I can make mistakes

Taking an easy way is slowing down
Putting obstacles around your sunken walls
In a home without a road
A song without a note of hope
I dare you to forget the things you know

There's little pieces of the road in everything you do
And though you think I'm out to hurt you
I never wanted to
Maybe if I wasn't older we'd still be rolling by
Maybe we would still be rolling

You want a better way to take my time
To relieve me of the things I have to do
If you want to, sing along
To save it all and make it so
You'll always have a way to make it me

Please don't let this chain you
We've lost our way

Fischer-Z,"When I read your letter I couldn't believe that you'd gone.
I dialed your number but no one answered the phone.
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you were,
They said they thought that you were ill.

I hired a detective to try and find out where you are.
He managed to trace you, he said you were living in France.
A watchman saw you climb into someone else's car and drive off
Laughing in the night. Why didn't you tell me? Not leave me this way.
You could have told me and not waited for so long.

I've tried to forget you but I find myself walking the street.
I went to the doctor and he gave me something to sleep. I've sent
You telegrams but you haven't answered one. Your mother told me
I best leave you well alone. I hope you're satisfied now you've done

This thing to me. I hope you're pleased with what you've done.
Why didn't you tell me? Not leave me this way. Oh you could have told
Me and not waited for so long.

For so long I never realized just exactly who you were. I never
Realized just exactly. I've never realized the girl I had before.
I hope you're satisfied you won't hear from me again. I hope
You're pleased with what you've done. Why didn't you tell me?

Not leave me this way. Oh you should have told me and not
Waited for so long.",So Long,1994

Pretty paracetamol you soothe my aching brow,
I need you when my heard is spinning round,
I look into the looking glass but none of them is me,
It takes at least an hour to put me down,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.
I hold you gently on my tongue and then you drift away,
It's hard to read the writing on the label,
I force my eyes out sideways but I can't resist the strain,
And it don't help me, no it don't help me,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.
I think I recognize a friendly face I've seen before,
I'm floating far too quickly to be sure,
(don't you despair)
Take this inner web of twisted memories and lies,
(There's no one there)
I'm fighting for a reason to go on.
Pretty paracetamol you soothe my aching brow,
I need you when my heard is spinning round,
I multiply myself by two in the mirror on the wall,
And it don't help me, no it don't help me,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.

Keeping off the flies
Swollen stomach, swollen head
And sad and swollen eyes
Waiting for the charity
That slowly dribbles in
This little boy's relying on
The colour of your skin
We did it for the jaguars
The pandas and the seals
And saved protected species
With our desperate appeals
We did it for the elephants
And monkeys in a sack
And just like you we lost a few
They're never coming back
Crouching in the diesel fumes
Holding out their hands
Open targets, open to a
Million grains of sand
Glaring in the camera
Blinking in the lights
Hoping for a miracle to set the world to rights
We're cutting back on our aerosols
Saving on our fuel
And stomping out the bloodsports

Begun, It's just begun.

Are you still a russian princess rescued by a gypsy dancer
To anyone who'll listen is that a story you tell?
You live a life of fantasy, your diary romantic fiction.

Can't you see it's hard for me, can you see what I am trying to say?
It's a gentleman's excuse me so I'll take on step to the side.
Can you get it in your head I'm tired of dancing?
For every one step forward we're taking two steps back.
Can you get it in your head I'm tired of dancing?

I know you still like old fashioned waltzes
Your reflection in the mirror that you flirt with as you glide across the floor
But if I told you the music's over would you want to hear
That your dance card is empty that there's no-one really there?
Do you still believe in santa claus, that there's a millionaire
Looking at your front door with a key to a life that you'd never understand?
All I have to offer is the love that I have, it's freely given
You'll see it's value when you see what I've tried to say.

There's no turning back?

Cool dust oozing out of every pore

Down at Easter Road till his throat is raw
On a Saturday, he knows the score
Till the whistle blows and
The colors with their tempers fade away

At the time just a little white lie.

And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans.
But for now, only, our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed.
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone;
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd.

Day by day it's getting louder,
And day by day it's getting stronger.
But when I can't scream no more, and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.

No one ventures into the streets these days,
Except strangers and those like me, looking for work.
I noticed the smell when I got off the bus,
And traced it down to a canal that ran
Right through the heart of the city,
Like an open vein full of black rotten blood.
A mirror surface, broken only by the bubbles of gas
Escaping from the stagnating mess that lay on the bottom.
Fuelled by the chemicals and effluent of the city,
Which was fed, in turn, by the barges and the ships

Surface to the dockside, where they unloaded their holds.

That I was questioning the source of the smell.

And, as the afternoon was wasted, I became aware
I was becoming wrapped up in his world.

It was taking me away from the canal,
And away from my questions.
I was aware that the perfumes were all around us;
And he sold me the city, well at least he tried to with all his stories.

And all the satins out of Spain.

Do you slow march off the edge, with head held high?
Do you do down gently without a fight?
Do you take it on the chin and beg for more?
When the sword is raised and the trumpet calls,
You bow down, bow down, bow down to the Emperor's song.
Did you believe in the post-war dream?
Do you hate dealing with machines?
And one's picking up your prayer off the phone.
You followed advice, you followed the work.
You followed the rules, you gave it your lot,
But a younger man's just taken on your job.
We've all got long term contracts with the man upstairs,
But who's picking up the options on our souls?
When it's one life firm and the deal is up,
You bow down, bow down to the Emperor's song.
What do you do when its all too much?
When you're out of luck and out of touch,
And you can't relate to anything they say?
What you do when it gets too tough,
When you want to say that enough's enough?
You want to walk away and just throw in the towel.
Do you go with the grain, do you go with the tide?
Do you go with the crowd, do you go for the ride?
Do you hang on in until the bitter end?
There's a bandwagon leaving but it's not for me.
I've swallowed all the hooks and want no more.
But when the lights are dimmed and the curtain calls,
You bow down, bow down, to the Emperor's song.",Emperor's Song,1996
Fish,"I was walking in the park dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns
Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love, IOU for your love

I was coming off the ropes, I was going to give them hell.
Now I'm waiting,
Waiting on the lyric, waiting on the song.
I know the muse is coming, I'm holding on.
I'm waiting,
Waiting on the chances, waiting on the breaks,
Waiting on an opportunity that I could take.
I'm still waiting.

Where I'm going, where I belong?
Tell me where I'm coming from,
Because I'm waiting in the pipeline.
Waiting on a message, waiting on a sign.
I was waiting on my holy grail to shine.
Waiting with the crossword, waiting on reviews,
Waiting on something or someone to give me a clue.
I'm still waiting.

Just what or who the hell I am?
Where I'm at, where I'm from?
Where I'm going, where I belong?
Why do you keep me waiting on?
Because I'm waiting in the pipeline.
If the carpet that I'm sitting on could fly,
If the ring that's on my finger was a sorcerer's charm,
If the cloak that I'm wearing could hide me away,
I could wait for forever and a day.
If the lady that I'm waiting on isn't mine,
Then the castles that I'm building are on shifting sands.
If the dream that I'm chasing isn't true,
Then the light at the end of the tunnel is just a wrecker's fire.
Waiting in the pipeline, waiting on the silence,
Waiting on the sound, waiting in the backstage,
Waiting on the crowd, waiting,
Waiting on the critic, waiting on the gong,
Waiting on the DJ to play my song.
Play my song, I'm waiting.
And all the time I wonder why,
Just what or who the hell I am?

Just hear me out.
If I could have your attention?
Just quietin' down for a voice in the crowd.
I get so confused and I don't understand.
I know you feel the same way you've always wanted to say,
But you don't get the chance.
Just a voice in the crowd.

I don't know the score anymore;
It's not clear anymore.
I can't tell right from wrong anymore;
I just don't understand.
I was sitting here thinking of exchanging a new world for old;
Like changing the channels on TV,
Or the dirt that we stand in, to gold.

When I was young
My father told me just bad guys die,
At the time just a little white lie.
It was one of the first but it hurt me the most,
And the truth stung like tears in my eyes;
That even the good guys must die.
There's no reasoning, no crimes, and I never knew why.
Even now, it still makes me cry.

If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just some answers to the questions that surround me now.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors,
Where nothing here is ever what it seems.
You stand so close but you never understand it.
For all that we see is not all that it seems; am I blind?

And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we're fighting,
Then I`ll join you and gladly make plans,
But for now only our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge,
By the hill and the will to succeed,
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you just let me know
I'm not standing alone,
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd?

If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
If there's somebody up there, just throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors,
Where nothing is exactly how it seems.
You're reaching out, you're so close you can touch it,
But it all disappears when it's always so near.
But one day, we will find that we stand in the light.
Until then, I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors.
Nothing here is ever what it seems.
I'm scared to shout, in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives,
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon; that is truth.

Day by day it`s getting louder,
And day by day it`s getting stronger.
But when I can`t scream no more and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.

And the hill - it stared back.",Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors,1996

Hi, Doc
Hey Fish, what are you doin'?
If you don't mind we're gonna record this
Is that cool?

Oh, that's cooler'n hell
Hell yeah, 52's biggest dream man
You know his biggest dream was
Me and him go party with you

On the trail of torn out twisters
Two angels on a mission came
Dust devils danced before them
In the path of the hurricane

On the road to Oklahoma
Through the flatlands from L.A.
From the shadows in the valley
From a country where the lizards play

While they drove they kept the radio on
Why don't you sing along, sing along, sing along?

A man stands behind his words
These men are together with family
To defend their rights in another man's world

Okay, here's what happened

52 barred the door shut from the inside
A gunfight started on the front porch
52 shot back

You know they come into his home with it
So he's protecting himself
The guy inside the house blew his brains out

Yeah, they made it look like he killed himself
But no one believes he would
'Cause he's not that kind of man, that's all

I think, he wasn't afraid of death
You know, he believed in something to die for
That's what he did

Some say he had it coming
Others say he was sole to blame
But who says they've got the rights
If any at all to blow the brothers away

A man got a right to dream

Just like that Waco Texas
Or any of these other things

Anybody that's stockpiling firearms and ammunitions
Is a threat to the government
So the government wages war against us

They tortured him, he went out
But I'm sure he stood up
Like he was supposed to, you know?

They smashed all the rings
Shut on his fingers with a hammer
It was all an orchestrated plan, man

The more the closer I was getting to it to the truth
The more they got everybody looking at me
As being the guy that pulled the trigger

Fish,"The car finally burned out around three. The blue beacon
Of a silent patrol car threw new shadows into the street
Turning the window into a flickering monitor screen
I'd seen the kids torch the vehicle before I left, on a
Nightly surfing run to a cybersex site in Chile
It wasn't as if they were getting rid of prints, everyone
Knew it was them. They didn't give a shit. They just
Wanted to see the flames, to throw a bit of light on a
Situation. I looked up the hill at the spread of the estate
The streetlights glowed like campfires of an army on the
Eve of battle, or fireflies trapped in the canopy
Of an immense jungle
Jungle, young mental jungle
Here in the jungle, in the jungle
Where men don't cry, and husbands lie, and you never have
To justify a kickin'
When mates jump in to save your skin, if a chib is ever
Pulled out in a square go

Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it's over
Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it ends

Oh, here she comes 'round again, here she comes round again
Here she comes round again, here she comes, here she comes
The glazed eyes of porcelain clowns stare skywards, at clouds
Of goldfish, madly circling their own silent plastic worlds, high
Above the children who stuff ping pong balls like pills
In the mouths of slowly rotating heads
Intentions true as the arrow's flight wins a cuddly toy
To while away an evening. Outside this ring of light
He'll claim his prize, she'll sport lovebites just to
Prove to all he's been there

Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it's over
Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it ends

Oh, here she comes round again, here she comes round again
Here she comes round again, here she comes, here she comes
I crept along the edges of the parade, staying glued to the
Shadows where the dogs slept uneasily on their chains
Under the caravans
I followed the drums and the pulsing light, until I came across
A clearing in the centre, of which was the attraction
And then I saw her, an angel in a chariot, her hair
Trailing behind her like the tail of a comet and I knew
That she was mine. I knew that we were destined
To leave this place together. We didn't belong to this
Carnage, and the knowledge of escape was the only thing
Keeping me sane. But for now I could only watch and
Wait, for this was an arena I dare not enter
On the rim of the machine the animals had gathered
Big cats at a waterhole, waiting on the weak and wounded
To stagger into their territory, so they could exercise
Some violence and feed their starving reputations
No climb-down in this standoff with the world
They already know that they can never win the war
But in this battle they're gonna do some damage
The pack will follow the stragglers into the dawn

And they don't discover you hiding in the cellar

Because you've got nowhere to go

As the doorways they were full of refugees and lonely people staring at me, they were asking of me:
What colour is god?

Don't keep on looking down at me as if I don't exist, as if I'm not here.

Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me.

Uniform man got a nervous partner;
Weapon was pulled from a shoulder holster.
White jogger see the roadside gangsta;
Heart beat just a little bit faster.
Rasta man speaking in the island patois;
Gonna give you the righteous answer.

Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?

Fish,"When you're down to the last skin
And the limelight splutters to darkness in the death of a Zippo.
At the backstage door the last fan has long disappeared
With a plastic bag stuffed full of memories.
If only you'd signed them, if only to testify, if only to recognize that he existed.
That for a moment he stood there.
Side by side in the gutter on the hard cold shoulder of destiny.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Well happy birthday to me!

When you're the worm in the bottle.
You're the last one to leave and there's nowhere to go to.
And the minicab driver politely suggests you go home.
If you could only remember, just where that's at,
Just where you been, just where it went wrong.
You'll eventually find it.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Well happy birthday to me!

When you're down to the end line and they're writing you up and writing you off and it feels just like an obituary.
You feel it's all over. You want to drive on down to the beach
And just keep on swimming. But you're still treading water.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.

Just another jewboy, spic, mick, yid, raghead motherfucker living on the planet.

You settled in a habit, so now you're Mr Fixit,

And you know there's some days when you feel that something's gonna happen,
This is one of those days which you know that something's gonna happen,
And something's gonna happen.

Somedays you just wake up and you don't have any real sense of direction, you just can't find the will to get up and go through with it all, your next allotted 24 hour slice of destiny.
There's just a bad vibe and rather than a world of opportunities, it's full of threats and just too many negative variables.
I'd noticed these houses way up in the hills and I tried to imagine what it would have been like living up there isolated from the world, every night watching the fires crawl slowly down the valley, and knowing that one night it was gonna be your turn for the visit.
I tried to imagine what it would have been like hiding in a cellar with your family and the fear hoping that when they do come, when the dogs don't bark, and the silence is around you, you hope that they burn the whole house around your ears and they don't discover you hiding in the cellar because you've got nowhere to go, and you know that one day that something's gonna happen.
There's one day, just one day.

Just another village burning in the hills,
I saw it on the TV, just another thrill,
Someone else's problems, someone else's grief,
Someone else's children, living on the planet,
We are in another world living on the planet,
We are in another world living on the planet, we are, we are.

It's just one of those places that never exist till you've been there,
It's just one of those things that you never will see till you wake up,
And you know that somewhere there's somebody that's out there who thinks like you do.
And you hope that today is the day that it's all gonna happen for you.
And you know there's somedays when you feel that something's gonna happen.
This is one of those days which you know that something's gonna happen.",The Perception of Johnny Punter [Demo],1997

Fish,"Time was when I called you before we went to sleep
No matter where we were,
No matter the moment, no matter the time
Time was when the words we spoke were always true,
There was no need to lie or hide at that time the answers we knew,
There were no questions, there was no need, our love was there to be believed
But in time the passion seemed to appear so obligatory.

Time was when the moments seemed to last forever,
Time was when we never thought we would be anything but together,
Lonely people in separate rooms, lonely people with nothing to do,
Lonely people just like me and you, so predictable, so sadly true,
So sadly true, so obligatory,
Just like me and you, so obligatory, so obligatory.

If time will be a healer then time will be my friend
And in time the shadows lift and I can begin to live again,
But in the hollows of this aching heart remains a soul that was torn apart
And in time I will make a new start, oh so obligatory,
Learn to love again, oh so obligatory, so obligatory.
I will love again, so obligatory.

I still love you, so obligatory,

 But you could find it if you really cared, 
 Because I pay my taxes and I pay my dues, 
 All I ask for in return is the truth. 
 Can we just be honest, I've heard that speech is free 
 So please believe me that this address is sincere 
 I'm no-one special, just a regular guy 
 But I just can't keep on wondering why 
 That the shells we fired they now kill our own 
 And we waste away like shadows in our homes. 
 I fell from blue skies, fought through desert storms 
 I froze in firefights, I killed someone, 
 That had a father who loved him just like mine 
 Who believed the sacrifice was justified 
 In the name of freedom and in the name of God 
 While shifting sands hid all our sins and all the blood 
 In the wake of glory, I flew back home 
 I watch videos at night in my uniform 
 Of those towns and cities being blown apart 
 By those bombs that fool the people by being smart 
 As they flew down chimneys, flew along corridors 
 And explode on film and everyone goes 'awe!' 
 And you read the stories about how no-one's killed 
 And I think about the photos that I kept 
 To remind me that it was all for real 
 And the ghost that I've become will be released 
 To the sands still shifting that cover all the lies 
 About what really happened and who really died. 
 Was it really worth it? 
 Was it worth the cost? 
 Did we really take the high ground or have we lost all the moral battles, did we lose the war? 
 Mr President I need to know for sure 
 That with all this knowledge, all this control 
 That we were on the right side after all 
 That we weren't lied to, that we weren't used 
 And the country that we fought for still upholds the truth. 
 Mr President you don't know my name 
 But you can find it if you really cared 
 It's on a black wall, it's on a cross of stone 
 In the Balkan States, the Gulf and close to home 
 On not so foreign islands out on city streets

Between goldfish and clowns can a love still be found
Well, what's the difference? What is the difference?

Between playing away and playing at home

Evening standard: late one!...

Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress
Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town
Awaiting the prince in his white capri
Dynamic young tarzan courts the bedsit queen

She's playing the actress in this bedroom scene
She's learning her lines from glossy magazines
Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen

Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile
But for now it's just another chelsea Monday, chelsea monday.

Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of london,
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause,
To chelsea Monday

She'll pray for endless sundays as she enters saffron sunsets
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn,
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the st. tropez mirage
Fragrant aphrodisiac, the withered tuberose,
Of chelsea Monday, sweet chelsea Monday

Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile
But for now it's just another chelsea Monday, sweet chelsea Monday

(spoken:) hello john, did you see the standard about four hours ago?
Fished a young chick out of the old father
Blond hair, blue eyes
She said she wanted to be an actress or something
Nobody knows where she came from, where she was going
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face
She was smiling
What a waste!

Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress
Buried in her cellophane world in glitter town,
Of chelsea Monday

Fish,"You should have listened to what your mother said
You should have listened to what your father told you to do
But you always did just what you always wanted to do
Now you end up here singing in a gilded cage
And for half your life you were wishing you were half your age
Lady let it lie

It's hard putting down family roots when you're living in
A mobile home, but there's always blood even in a rolling stone
And you squeezed me hard for the white collar dream
But you woke up to a tie dye lifestyle and its choking me

When it all worked out I was just a pretender
I could never disagree if you said you were dissatisfied
But why you got to take it out on a guy that tried

All the boys want to be all the girls want to be all the boys
I don't want to be me no more
All the boys want to be all the girls in this turnaround world
I don't want to be me no more

But surely there's something left, something worth fighting for
Something out of all this mess that's worth building on
Maybe we can start again, maybe give it one more try
Or do we just walk away, and maybe fade and die

All the boys want to be all the girls want to be all the boys
I don't want to be me no more

Fish,"Incredible thoughts
Incredible minds
I'm so overwhelmed
How did my brain conceive them?

A snow-white dove in the pitch-black night
A rain drop falls from tremendous heights
A wave crashes off of a cliff in Scotland
A child bites an apple, but the core is rotten
TV is free, but what is the cost?
We have GPS and yet, we're still lost
A carrot in the desert, a camel in the garden
A man with giant ears begging your pardon
What if a garbage man was actually smart?
A common misconception that we're tearing apart
And to a dog, dog food is just food
And to a sock, a mansion's just a big shoe
A Milk Dud, sitting in the acid rain
A housecat addicted to the cocaine
No teeth, unlimited floss
These are just a few of our incredible thoughts

Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
Too many great ideas inside
It's a miracle my head can contain them
My spectacular brain
For all humankind
Changing how we think about space and time
Now it's time to share them with the people

A ballerina waits for the bus
A number-one dad trophy covered in rust
An nun dunked in basketball living the impossible
A man breaks his leg inside a hospital
We just thought of that and it can change the world
World like a smart oyster full of pearls
Such as has an ultrasound of a new baby
With a Santa hat drawn on, yeah that's my kind of Christmas card
What if a butterfly was made out of butter?
These small thoughts could destroy Big Brother
The world's cutest kittens just hugging a dog
Just one of our incredible thoughts
What if one thought could cure the people?
What if one song could end all evil?
Imagine if a fish could play guitar
And also sing, it would sound bizarre like
""My name is Mr. Fish
These guys thoughts have granted my wish""
And that may have just changed the course of time
I swear my mind blows my mind, incredible

Brave are those who do decide

Unless the calls get misdirected

Another trend to follow
Another word to linger on
They may not even know the reasons why
You think without a vision, and they try to call it ours
And it's causin' me to culture shock

The fools all hide behind the fashion
The new age rebels have no cause
But little do they realize, that a true change can come from within
But that's too simple to be true
My hair looks better now in blue
Is it true profession, or just another way to stay along?
Sometimes I even ask myself

Another generation, another forward state of mind
It's somewhere deep within our consciousness
Is it a new beginning, for those who need a second chance
Maybe then we'll find out why we did

Another generation, another forward state of mind
It's somewhere deep within our consciousness

The `prefects` make their margin call
Will you join the ranks of sheep
That will not a soul to keep
Their premise is intelligence
Profaned by human arrogance
If you stand against it all...
Make the bastards fall...

Who are your true enemies ?

I see the dung heaps piled at least a mile high
I see the shards of shattered dreams in the street

My breakfast finished now i brave the outside
But clouds have hidden all the warmth inside

Chase these clouds away
I hate this sunless Saturday

Freedom come
For us now
Light our sky
Burn away these clouds

Perhaps the charcoal grey and brown around me
Is just the mirror image of tainted soul
I think the sun will never visit my sky
Until the truth is seen by each and every eye

I see a pauper singing in the pouring rain
I see the means of help elude us again

Fell down my chimney with a keg of brew
Put my dog out in the cold
Ripped off the candy from my socks
Smokin' coal and drinkin' scotch

(devil you, devil you)
Slick nick you devil you
(devil you, devil you)

Dressed in red and overweight boot
Stole the tv and the stereo
And the toys
The toys were broken too

You devil you

I saw slick nick fall over the x-mas tree
He was a whole different man from
What mom and dad told me
Spillin' jack daniels all over the drapes
Spray-painting a bad finger over the fireplace
Tatoos on his arms and knees
I never thought santa claus would be such a sleaze ! but...

Slick nick you devil you...

Cussin' and coppin' and playin' punk-rock
And every once in a while you'd just scratch your jock
Hey ! slick nick, where are my toys ? 
You went drinking with the boys
You put mad dog in my sock
I wanted candy (x3)
Oh, oh ! I thought you were my buddy and chum
But you're just a downtown bum
Instead of putting presents in front of my eyes
You just told me a bunch of lies...

To all who can fathom a subsidiary atmosphere

To resist the strategies of containment brought on to us

Inhospitable cellular chain gangs
And the slaves speak of consumerism
And in the monsters of plastic that await
Behind the hidden corners of the new hype
The surrender of our dignities
And the disintegrate of the Wamo Frisbee
Within us all of the side effects of the emerging techno psychology

The push button landscape of the coming millenia
And it intellectual discriminations can`t be avoided
They can only be down graded repudiated
And Afthroplacentrically renovated

The history distorting legislative heartbeat of the coming century
Aligns itself with weakness and over indulgence
Chim Chim's Badass Revenge
Suggests that you structure your acceptance of the frequencies
According to hope and man and a kick ass outlook
If you try you will catch on

The reinvention accelerates from this point
For it is with these words and the spirit of
Chim Chim's Badass theory of religiosity that we bring
you the only antidote that humanity will ever know

Fishbone,"Love, hate

Love is deep within your gut
Struck with fire to the touch
Hate is when you can't relate
In a different state to hate, revenge
Execute pain to the thief of love

Filled with hate, I won't mistake
Inside out pin love is grand
Outside in pain, hate awaits

Ain't love grand? It saves the human
Sometimes love is never finished
Some times hate is never ending
Love and hate, too close for most
But revenge can make it even

Love, hate

Love to hate to love to kill
By the will of loving to hate
Kill the love with your fear and then
The revenge will set in

Revenge, quench the hate in the mean time
But in the end your soul will end
Like a junkie that needs his shot
Hate revenge the brotha's twins

Love is solid and won't go nowhere
Love will stay as sure as life lives
Love will stay it's crept in everywhere
Love, hate, too close for most
But revenge can make it even

Revenge is gained when hate kills love
Love rises above because love is the dove
Love and hate both are the same
Causing the extreme opposites of the same pain

When we meet on the fields of onions
To make war brings tears to my eyes
Love and hate brings tears to my eyes
When love dies hate will arise

It's a loving hate for the hate that loves
Love's to hate for a loveless hate
For a hateless love
Rather than the hate filled hate

But no love, man
That's impossible
That's preposterous
That's polukaism
Halt

If hate was a hat holding back
The hovering hate less hate
Un-hate yourself
Of this hate hat

And let the hate less love
Lift loud and lovable
That's been looming
Under your hate hat
Of  helter skelter

Love don't loath, live and love
Happy not hate
Happy joy love and happiness cool no heat
Hate is the enemy

Hate will arise for you to despise
Hate is laughing at your fate
Love is beautiful and it is potent
Love inhibits the inhabitant of love
Love is the permanent state
Hate is for the late freight

Peace, love and hate can definitely relate

Fishbone,"When I was a kid I would go to the show and see the rock star
I`d play my records and look at the album cover at the rock star
Sometimes I`d check out the R&B
But the polka, salsa classical scene just was not me
I wanted to be like Bootsy, Dr. Funkenstein or Jimi the rock star

Color meant nothing to me
Everything was equal as far as I could see
Ignorant to the racist music industry music industry music industry

Everywhere I look... White rock star
Read it in the paper... White rock star
Watch it on TV... White rock star

Only just a little... Black rock star
Only for a token... Black rock star
Sing no controversy... Black rock star

Sometimes for the flavor of Japanese
No communication but it`s overseas

Unaware of how propaganda works
I soon became a victim, a trick at work
With my black brotha`s playin` rock & roll
Signed and ho`in for a major label
Selling my soul as a rock star

Do the rock star ohh
Do the rock star yeah

Break a window, smash a TV
We`re some hott mother fucka`s it`s no doubt about
We do the rock star Ohh
Do the rock star, yeah

Get real drunk, fuck, fuck, fuck
Kick in the radio, smash up a chair
Do the rock star, wooh

Wreck your hotel room, catch a Lear jet
Stay in debt, manic depressed
Sweat & jerk to the best
Smoke a cig, fuck, fuck, fuck
Lie fry loosin` your mind like a rock star

I got supposed fortune & fame
With existential potential Of runnin` the game
But it the greedy of the whitey at the top of my frame that`s

Blurrin` my art piece
Makin` it weak see
Makin` it watered down
Dilutin` my funky sound
But it`s all you need to be
In this weak society
Powder puffy rock star dumb
Keepin` people stupid and dumb

Do the rock star ooh
Do the rock star hey

Shoot up some heroin
Snort some cocaine
Smash your guitar
Wreck a jet plane
With a short gun to your brain
For the price of fame
Losers !!!

Kurt Cobain meant nothing to me
But now I just can`t escape from the rains that drive me ape
Of their white fear
Through the television in my eyes in my ears
Racism ! Separation ! Media !
So I guess you can say I`m an angry brotha
Can`t play my music `cause of barrier of color
Deep in debt with a seven record set
Videos and funky shows but no one knows
The major pain and misery of bein` radical
Speakin` of what you feel in a world that`s sad and dull

Go tell the world nothing's ever your fault

Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

And hold this memory for inside your head

Angels have filled the sky with fiery tails
They flash like cameras in the night
And fall into the grass to live again
As they turn into fire flies

Open your eyes get out of bed
And take this memory for inside your head
Inside your head

It's freezing cold, why should we care?
Climb on the roof and hold my hand
Let's live another hundred years
And meet here when the stars rain down again
