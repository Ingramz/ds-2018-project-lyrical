Natalie Mendoza,"The French are glad to die for love
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your pompus cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Tiffany!
Cartie!
Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Ah come and get me boys ow!
Black star, rozz call talk to me harry siblez, tell me all about it!
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a heart-boiled employer thinks you're awful nice
Get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stakes are high but beware when they start to descend
Ooh, diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Lets make love
Yes! Yes! Tiger! Oh everything was going so well! (screams)
Cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best,  friend",Sparkling Diamonds,2002
Natalie Merchant,"I found this photograph,
Underneath the broken picture glass.
Tender face of black and white,
Beautiful, a haunting sight.
Looked into an angel's smile,
Captivated all the while.
From the hair and clothes she wore,
I'd place her in between the wars.

Was she willing when she sat
And posed the pretty photograph?
Save her flowering and fair,
The days to come, the days to share.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

I found this photograph,
Stashed between the old joist walls,
In a place where time is lost,
Lost behind, where all things fall.
Broken books and calendars,
Letters script in careful hand,
Music too, a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band.

From the threshold what's to see
Of our brave new century?
The television's just a dream,
The radio, the silver screen.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day,
Was she hopeful, did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside,
Family secrets, sworn to hide?
Did she feel the beat that stirs,
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend,
The love and laughter, 'til the end?

Natalie Merchant,"Young and strong Hollywood son 
In the early morning light 
This star fell down 
On Sunset Boulevard 

Young and strong beautiful one 
We embraced so close 
Is gone 
Was torn away 

Let the youth of America mourn 
Include him in their prayers 
Let his image linger on 
Repeat it everywhere 

With candles, with flowers 
He was one of ours 
One of ours 

Why don't you let him be? 
He's gone 
We know 
Give his mother and his father peace 
Your vulture's candor 
Your casual slander 
You murder his memory 
He's gone 
We know 
It's nothing but a tragedy 

Lay to rest your soul and body 
Lay beside your name 
Lay to rest your rage 
Your hunger and amazing grace 

With candles, with flowers 
You were one of ours 
One of ours 

I saw cameras expose your life 
I heard rumors explode with lies 
I saw children in tears 
Cry and crowd around the sight 
Of where you had collapsed that day 
Where your last breath and word 
Had been sighed 
Where your heart had burst 
Where you had died 

I saw how they were lost in grieving 
All half believing you were gone 
The loss and pain of it 
Crime and shame of it 
You were gone 
It was such a nightmare raving, 
""how could we save him from himself?""",River,1995
Natalie Merchant,"Well, I've walked these streets
A virtual stage, it seemed to me
Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

Well, I've walked these streets
In a carnival, of sights to see
All the cheap thrill seekers vendors and the dealers
They crowded around me

Have I been blind have I been lost
Inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen?

Well, I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond markets the scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me

And I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum they can be
Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped and he raved of saving me

Have I been blind, have I been lost
Inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen

Have I been wrong, have I been wise
To shut my eyes and play along
Hypnotized, paralyzed by what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen
What they have seen?

Have I been blind
Have I been lost
Have I been wrong
Have I been wise
Have I been strong
Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have found
In that great street carnival

Have I been blind
Have I been lost
Have I been wrong
Have I been wise
Have I been strong
Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have found
In that great street carnival

In that carnival",Carnival,1995

The pages I could write 
But I don't know where to send it 
You have vanished 
Heaven knows where you live 
Heaven only knows

Bitter words it would contain 
Just and unrequited lover 
Wishing she had never 
Spoken your name 
Had never known your name

There was no measuring 
Far above this dirty world

Guardian of my life 
Damn you betrayer 
How you lied

Looking for the key to set me free

I want to shine like the sun

And upon it grows fine grain
Sure it is a place of residence
For a soldier to remain

Where the sugarcane is plentiful
And the tea grows on each tree
Well, I never had but the one sweetheart
And now he's gone far away from me

I will wear no stays around my waist
Nor combs all in my hair
I will wear no scarf around my neck
For to save my beauty there

And never will I marry
Not until the day I die
Since these four winds and these stormy seas
Came between my love and I

Natalie Merchant,"Well, I lived in a town
Way down south
By the name of Owensboro
And I worked in a mill
With the rest of the â??trashâ??
As we're often called
As you know

Well, we rise up early
In the morning
And we work all day real hard
To buy our little meat and bread
Buy sugar, tea, and lard

Well, our children they
Grow, grow up unlearned
With no time to go to school
Almost before they learn to walk
They learn to spin and to spool

Well, the folks in town
They dress so fine
And spend their money free
But they would hardly look
At a factory hand
That dresses like you or me

Would you let them wear
Their watches fine
Let them wear their gems
And pearly strings

But when that day
Of judgement comes
They'll have to share
Their pretty things

Once, a sailor loved me

he would come to my window and sing

we'll sail away to Mars

we passed by the Milky White Way 
While idly drifting, watching the stars

Natalie Merchant,"In a busy street, a man sits down
Oblivious to the traffic sounds
No chaos, no frenzied shrieking crowd
Thank God their silence, walking heads, bent down

Come when they saw us
Called it lethargy
The treadmill turns
There down below their feet

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or cross the waves of an angry sea
Risking, risking and braving, braving
The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing, assailing

In a haunted doorway and from the light of day
See another life fall to ruin in pain
False smiles from even children it seems
Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams

A league against me
I hear him say
It's not worth half the effort
Or the price you pay

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the Heavens above
And tell God, dear God, stop jeering and jeering
As our human frailties and all our failings, are we failing?

Pound, pound on an endless street
Again and again the nightmare scene
All strained against the tightened rope
Not one with a lasting lingering hope

There's evidence
Everywhere you see
Put a quarter down at the newsstand
So that you can read

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the clouds above
Entreating, entreating
Their mercy, some mercy

But as clouds will do, they'll rain down
First gently, gently and sweetly, so sweetly
Until they silence me
With a burst of thunder, thunder and lightning and lightning
And helpless landlocked screaming
I know god must be agreeing

It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching

They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum

To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, ""Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: 'E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,

Natalie Merchant,"A capital ship for an ocean trip
Was ""The Walloping Window Blind,""
No gale that blew dismayed her crew
Or troubled the captain's mind.
The man at the wheel was taught to feel
Contempt for the wildest blow,
And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared,
That he'd been in his bunk below.

The boatswain's mate was very sedate,
Yet fond of amusement, too,
And he played hop-scotch with the starboard watch
While the captain tickled the crew.
And the gunner we had was apparently mad,
For he sat on the after-rail,
And fired salutes with the captain's boots,
In the teeth of the booming gale.

The captain sat in a commodore's hat,
And dined, in a royal way,
On toasted pigs and pickles and figs
And gummery bread, each day.

But the rest of us ate from an odious plate,
For the food that was given the crew
Was a number of tons of hot-cross buns,
Chopped up with sugar and glue.

And we all felt ill as mariners will,
On a diet that's cheap and rude,
And the deck shook when we dipped the cook
In a tub of his gruesome food.
Then nautical pride we laid aside,
And we cast the vessel ashore
On the Gulliby Isles, where the Poohpooh smiles,
And the Anagazanders roar.

Composed of sand was that favored land,
And trimmed with cinnamon straws,
And pink and blue was the pleasing hue
Of the Tickletoeteaser's claws.

And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge
And shot at the whistling bee,
And the Binnacle-bats wore water-proof hats
As they danced in the sounding sea.

On rubagub bark, from dawn to dark,
We fed, till we all had grown
Uncommonly shrunk when a Chinese junk
Came by from the torriby zone.

She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care,
And we cheerily put to sea,
And we left the crew of the junk to chew
The bark of the rubagub tree.",The Walloping Window Blind,2010
Natalie Merchant,"Isabel met an enormous bear,
Isabel, Isabel, didn't care,
The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,
The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.
The bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,
How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!

Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,
Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.
Once in a night as black as pitch
Isabel met a wicked old witch.
The witch's face was cross and wrinkled,
The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.

Ho, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,
I'll turn you into an ugly toad!
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry,
She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,
But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.

Isabel met a hideous giant,
Isabel continued self-reliant.
The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,
He had one eye in the middle of his forehead.
Good morning Isabel, the giant said,
I'll grind your bones to make my bread.
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She nibbled the zwieback that she always fed off,
And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.

Isabel met a troublesome doctor,
He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.
The doctor's talk was of coughs and chills
And the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.

The doctor said unto Isabel,
Swallow this, it will make you well.
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She took those pills from the pill concocter,
And Isabel calmly cured the doctor.",Adventures of Isabel,2010

Wore around my neck for him
Hunger, anger, lust, and greed
Envy, pride, and jealousy

There was one, I guess, that was the worst of all
That gave a little push, started the fall
From grace that I took so high
I took so long, so long and far

But I just couldn't spend me another night
In the cold, cold bed of the butcher's wife
So afraid to fall asleep
Afraid to wake, and afraid to dream

Bite my tongue for another hour
One more endless day
Day after night, and night after day

In the bloody way
In the bloody, bloody war
In the bloody, bloody war

Well, I'm far too quick with the poison pen
Can't believe I'm writing again
After all these God damned years
And some day when the ghosts have all gone home
Far too late to be rattling bones
Then will you lay me down?
Lay me down
Oh, will you let it be?

Natalie Stewart,"If you feel alone is best to expose any thoughts of doubt,
You gotta air it out!
Awake, agree to know the day with the choices that you make,
Decide what you will live, decide what you will take,
Decisions, to release what you don't need
If you gotta let it be, then you have to let it be!
Be careful not to keep,
The residue of anything that had you feel weak,
Like what was said, versus what you think,
Sometimes you own assumptions of the ways that make you sink,
Feeling down,
It could be an addiction,
Getting up,
Right before the hesitation,
It takes determination,
Don't fall for the distractions,
These attractions are the target of your soul.
Asking you to stay when you know you have to go.
You know the things you know,
It's your past just your own,
Lessons will be lessened if you listen to their fear,
Hear your truth, keep it near!
And then you just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

Avoid all this confusion,
Refuse this illusion even if you destiny is not blessed.
It's your time!
No matter who came before you,
Don't let them where you're down,
The pain of your heart,
She's your own mind.
It's irrelevant,
If relevance is measured by the elements
Without bearing a, without your own kind of,
You may find that we're living in an area that can't be defined.
Like those who thought that this was the end?
Like those who thought that the enemies would win,
Like those who let paranoia tend an insight out,
You know what this life is all about.
Can you remember before anyone had taught you
To feel as if life would never gonna treat you,
Better than a lesson, but that was in a pre-course,
What about now?
You took

Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

You can do anything you want to do!
Anything that your heart truly chooses,
And may be a lonely journey but it's yours!
Is your purpose!
You may have to leave some things behind you,
You may have to change your mind
And you can't bring everybody with you,
They will be better off for having known you,
So just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!",Breathe,2010

Natalie Stewart,"She started with a day dream
Working on a maybe
Focusing on being there
Standing in the middle

Start composing for the camera and her mind
Keep an ordered diet behind it
She's on the golden path
Everywhere that she goes

And it's only her who knows her purpose and real truth
She's not afraid that she'll lose
Cause there is no such thing
When you do something special

More or less it just feels equal
Listen to the beats and headphones
She writes everywhere she goes
On napkins and paper bags

Few verse or a rhyme
Sometimes she stays up all night
Cause her frequencies are clear
She intends to be the difference she wants to hear

She makes it clear she's not the property of commodity
Of some brother with a big chain
She's got real games not tricks
Slick and quick

Watching no one but herself
Inspired by everything
Handle no dream
She's more than a desire in everything they need

She's a queen
Walking in the light on the hill toward her horizon
Sharing she knows who she is and that's a good thing
She's prepared for the opportunity of success

She's truly blessed
And you can hear it

When you're doing your thing
It's the way that you flow

If it's yours
Go get it go get it
The way that you flow
Makes the people wanna sing

She tries to keep her mind fit
She works ? rhyme
She has attraction on everything
She's a magnet

Power and energy makes the enemy obey
Makes the people rock and
Music chooses her
She keeps performing

And instead of using her art platform to be a diva
The people start to see her
She gets naked in her craft
Wearing a heart and her panties

Means that she feels a piece on the stage
Like she always has things to say
The desire to heal and grow
Not claiming to know all the things

But every day she remembers
Chanel in
Like she's plugged into a source
Of course she has learned from examples

It's like her spirit is a sample of it
She writes and he wrote
So she goes where her mind shows her
Sharing what she finds

Maybe she's been doing for life time
She's in her mind and you can hear her soul
Every time you hear her flow
Listen close

Natalie Stovall,"Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal.
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
Now he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.
Now if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
If you lose the devil gets your soul.

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Now, you're pretty good ol' son,
But just sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

He played ""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house with the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan picking out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.

And Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back. If you ever wanna try it again,
I done told you once you son of a gun, I'm the best that's ever been.""

Two monkeys, one father, six turtles and me
If momma was married

If momma was married, I'd jump in the air
And give all my toe shoes to you
I'd get all those hair ribbons out of my hair
And once and for all, I'd get momma out too
If momma was married

Momma get out your white dress
You've done it before without much success
Momma, godspeed and god bless
We're not keeping score, what's one more or less?

Oh, momma, say yes
And waltz down the hall while you may
I'll gladly support you, I'll even escort you
And I'd gladly give you away
Oh, momma, get married today

If momma was married there wouldn't be anymore let me entertain you
Let me make you smile
I will do some kicks
I would do some tricks
Sing out, Louise
Smile, baby

Momma, please take our advice
We aren't the lunts, I'm not fanny brice
Momma, we'll buy you the rice
If only this once you wouldn't think twice

It could be so nice if momma got married to stay
But momma gets married and married and married
And never gets carried away

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2000

But I want you to know I was there last night
I was there, I was there, I was there,

I dreamed we were talking last night

I covered your poster in mud
I cut out the eyes on the photo you signed
I wrote you a poem in blood

One day Ima learn hoe ass niggaz ain't worth my while
Funny style actin, dirty maccin, playa hatin, contemplatin, fuckin my thoughts up
I get caught up in this bullshit, the way bitches bullshit
Niggaz be jealous, sometimes even my fellas
Things change, niggaz rearrange whether ya tell us
Life is bullshit, and I know that this is true
Sometimes I feel depressed, what can a nigga do?
ain't no way out, only way out is the route of a slug point blank at my mug
Sometimes I just want to scream at the world, I'm mad
Other times I feel happy just to be sad
I don't really got much more to say
cus people die everyday, and we gonna all die anyway
Its kinda hard, but who said life was fair
And from the funky stains in my underwear
I don't care

No I don't care no more
No I don't care if niggaz stare at me
Look at my face, I ain't happy
Bitch what you want to come at me with?
Not that same shit, see I'm shameless
And I hang with that mentally derranged click
Stay up off it, you can't change this
can't teach a wicked witch new tricks
Hell's the fire on the candle sticks
Stay off these bloody streets
for you ain't gonna see no peace
I just don't give a fuck cus nobody gives a fuck about me
So we be like fuck 'em, mother fuck 'em, can't trust 'em
I'd rather .45 slug 'em before the grave diggers dug 'em
I'm ready when you not
my mind's twisted in a knot
Can't let jealous niggaz see me cause they'll kill me on the spot
Truth or dare, my gun gonna shoot up in the air
Pieces of my mind over there, and there
But I don't care

I'm thinkin bout my bitch and why she had to die
Some niggaz out to get me said she settin me up
They pulled out they pistols started wettin me up
I seen my life pass before my eyes in a flash
I drew down my weapon and I started to blast
My bitch caught a slug in the back of the neck
I emptied out the tech and niggaz hit the deck
I ran for the beamer it was sittin in front
I left my bitch's body smokin like a philly blunt
And it was

In the midnight hour, it all happened

I'm bleedin like a motherfucker grabbin my chest
My heartbeat racin like a EMS
I called my partner up on the portable phone
I blew my bitch brains out with the chrome
My nigga said he'd meet me at the Omni hotel
Court date was today and he just jumped bail
Police out to get him, he was under arrest
Bitch warrant for my nigga with the mental stress
Met my nigga at the spot and he had nothin to say
Metro airport to East L.A.
When we got the city it was drama again
Seen a nigga that we jacked in 89 for 10
And it was

The nigga started trippin he was wavin his gun
Pissed off since 89 cause we murdered his son
Straight bullets started flyin every way but in mine
Still bleedin like a pig and I'm pressed for time
I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face
Now I'm madder than a motherfucker tryin to embrace
My homie body turned cold, I felt him slippin away
He was just here alive now he dead today
And the nigga who had shot him, he was shot on the floor
So I went to his body and I shot him some more
He looked me dead in the face and said you're going to hell
I spit blood in his face as I started to yell

As I zoomed into the feature times rhyme with the clarity
No, I said it was all good in the land of prosperity
So I fly through the sky with a blink of an eye
Under the shade of my sombrero wouldn't think it was I
Mama see a seniorita we was smoking some reefer
She was hoping that I keep her but I'm nothin but a creaper
It gets deeper with the street sweeper
But on a day like today I just sit in back and parlay
In see-A-N, see-you-N

Drop the bigger figures

Cop a 4 with a 4-4 your undercover love go
From to Detroit to Chicago or wherever I go
I keep my blow tighter than the hair on your hoe
Under the cherry moon down in Cancun
I'm all about the boom 
Honeys know I'm about to hit the boom  boom
Up in Cancun all about the boom

Natas," 

I advise y'all to open your eyes
and ask JFK if flyin through the skies you can die
And all the ballers out there cookin them pies
do you even realize why we lookin so high?
It's a surprise, It's the end for us all
the hieroglyphics told mysteries on the pyramid walls
I feel the force drag me into the light
The same one who stole the life in the still of the night

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)
(I see dead people)

I often wonder, do dead men dream?
about the life they lived and all the fancy things?
about who was paid? and who was broke?
about who had the most money, ho's and dope?
about that one nigga who just couldn't cope
life came down crashin like a nigga on a ski slope
Can I rock this one for Redd Fox?
I saw Biggie Smalls, I saw Tupac
I saw the nigga with the gun bust 2 shots
some of you believe me and some of you do not

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)
(I see dead people)

Check the rigamortis, cause time moves slow as a tortoise
like a virgin, like Madonna till she had little Lordis
You can't afford us Time goes fast, life's the shortest
Officially for the good green weed and coke snorters
Support us, look how far the dead brought us
2000 AD rock the funeral parlors
Dead ballers and dirt crawlers, under the surface
You must know the difference, between an angel and the serpents

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)

Then if ya can't remember there's a hole then fuck God with no love 
Case closed, call it a day 
They fallen in all they can say 
Is rest in peace, now let us all pray 
I'm blessed and I'm cursed 
Feel the pain, my niggas feelin' worse 
The painted bloody herse, a black chrome on the perch
Ride through the universe, landin' on earth 
Demandin' my worth, puttin' in work, you the first jerk 
I do the day, doin' the day after midnight 
Hope you can catch some zzz, wake up get yo' shit right 
Too much in sight, wicket visionaires 
It's like all those lost souls in the streets, in the cememtaries 

I was there for the death
I'm there for the birth 
I'll be there when the meek inherit the earth 
Got yo' mind wicket

I'm on some I don't give a fuck shit 
I don't need no love shit 
I'm goin' public wit my problems 'cause I'm disgusted
Suckas tryin' to get at me, like they know me 
Niggas tryin' to do some wicket shit like they unholy 
Repentin' they sins, beg fo' forgiveness again 
Don't know the evil within, they can't even get in
You goin' against the wind, goin' against the me 
Who gone start and finish this shit from beginnin' to end 
Brothas sittin' in the pen or sittin' in the den 
Have yo' mind on that when, you lose and you win

I'm finna kill that nigga
Keep my finger on the trigga of my 40 cal

I pack heat, fuck a fist fight
Trained assassin, master of all techniques
Do yo bitch ass while you sleep, wrap yo body up in bloody bed sheets

I leave no prints or signs of force injury
My element of surprise is advanced to kill

Your body goes slump, put yo ass in the trunk
Another corpse I must dump

If i bust you might you might drop

I can't believe these niggas tryna play my niggas,

We all took cover then took out mothafuckas
Always ready to die always on the look out for suckas
There's always retaliation after invasion

I guess i better stop whippin' out gats in they face then
Can't even hold it back can't even hold a strap
without wantin' to blow a hole in they back
I guess i better start leavin dead and quiet

Natascia Diaz,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us
All

Thinking what else could go wrong
Would have stayed in bed
How can the day be so long?

But how this turned out removed all my doubts, so believe

Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

I missed the first train
Stood out in the rain all day, little did I know
When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubt, so believe

That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong I wouldn't change a thing

I'd do it, I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again

So I'd do it all over again

I'd do it all over again

Natasha Bedingfield,"Would ya spare a minute?
Give me a single chance
To look in your eyes
Let me hold your hands

I want to get close enough
To read you
Understand you
Open up your heart

Open up your mind
Nobody needs another stalker in your life
I'm only here to help you learn to love me
To know me

[Chorus]
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you, makes you want to stay. 
Don't want to speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't want to blink 'cause in a second you could be gone
I need a twist to help me to turn the story round
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through

Did ya see me staring
You caught my eye
Don't turn around
Don't walk away

The night is young, can we get together?
Got so many questions
Feelings I can't explain
We're worlds apart

Don't even know your name
I'm longing to give you my heart

[Chorus]

Turn around, don't evaporate
Like you never came 
Turn around don't be a ghost
Forever never there to haunt me

Sliding doors
They aren't just on a train
We're alone on a platform in the rain
There's a chance
And it won't come again
Turn around your whole life has changed

[Chorus]

Turn around
Turn around",The One That Got Away,2004

Of where my heart has been
And I cant hide the marks
Its not a negative thing
So I let down my guard
Drop my defences down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow

[Chorus]
I bruise easily
So be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily

I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too
But if I never take this leap of faith
I'll never know
So im learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow

Anyone who can touch you
Can hurt you or heal you
Anyone who can reach you
Can love you or leave you

Goin' on a shopping spree
Pick something out to look good on me
I want quality
Not quantity
Want a classic
Not a trend
Casual yet still high end
I know what I want
And I'm not afraid to spend

So if you
Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

I'm checking out
Goods on display
Don't play it safe or too risque
I'm done window shopping
I'm ready to pay
I'm going up
Fifth floor
The best stuff's in store
Cos that's where they keep
What every girl would die for

So if you
Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Everythings perfect
When you're looking through the glass
The colors can fade as seasons pass
This time I wanna, wanna nail them to the mast

Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love

You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

And bring you to me

I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

And hope this night will last forever

Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Had a plan, couldn't follow
Had a dream, it was hollow
Everywhere felt like nowhere
Everything was so boring

Life was never what I wanted

You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me

Restless ways for a living
Fitting in 'cause I was driven
Saying yes when I meant no
Holding on, should've let go

I was scattered all around
Left shattered on the ground
You picked me up

All I wanted was a little bit of hope
Couldn't find it
You showed me something
That I never knew I owned
You put a light to it

Oh, you found the peace of me

You put soul into it

What a life, lived without you
Don't leave me, and I won't
Fall apart, I won't leave you

Most blokes to shallow to swim in
Only interested in one thing
It's all so meaningless
'cause puddles dry up
With a view of the world so small
It limits the size of the dream
And you achieving it
A new panorama

They don't understand so be it

But I feel so A.D.D
I need some help some inspiration
But it's not coming easily...

Tryn'a write a classic

Read some Byron, Shelly, and Keats
Recited it over a hip hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines

You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar
Right up (this is on a separate line!)

No hyperbole to hide behind

I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
I'm looking out, hmmm
Is this my life I'm wondering
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Hmm, wide open spaces far away

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Ooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh

Yeah, oh oh, ye-yeah

I see the girl I want to be
Riding bare-back, care-free
Along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping head-first, head-long
Without a thought
To act and down the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I want to break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear, but not feel scared

Oooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh

I want to run too
Oooh oh oh oh
Recklessly emboundening myself before you
I want to open up my heart
Tell him how I feel, ooh ooh

Oooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to

Natasha Bedingfield,"The in and out of dating got me all cofused
I built up expectations and I'm feeling used
Seems that everybody's into fast food
Everybody's into quick
I want some one to take the time fine dining not rushing

Now it's nearly 7:30, I'm slipping on a dress
I keep my fingers crossed, you're not like all the rest
So when you come to pick me up come right to my door
Don't stay in your car and beep beep the horn

Baby I'm a hopeless romantic
You pick the sounds for the background to our drive into town
Baby don't be one of the traffic
Had too many nights with the wrong guys
Caught me at red lights

Tell me how many frogs do I have to kiss
Before I find my prince, before I find my prince
All you girls that are going through this
Tell 'em how it is, tell 'em how it is

Pull up to a premire, red carpet good
You take my coat, get my chair, like I hoped you would
You're funny and your flirting is really working for me
But where it goes from here
Better wait and see

Baby I'm a hopeless romantic
You pick the view to kiss to
Make me go ooo ooo
And baby it'll all turn out tragic
And you'll push for more
Back at my front door
More than I'm ready for

Tell me how many frogs do I have to kiss
Before I find my prince, before I find my prince
All you girls that are going through this
Tell 'em how it is, tell 'em how it is

Tell me how many frogs do I have to kiss
Before I find my prince, before I find my prince
All you girls that are going through this
Tell 'em how it is, tell 'em how it is

You gotta tip the waiter, that's how it works
You can't skip the starter and go straight to desert
You've gotta pop the cork before you taste the wine

We get hooked up but the shame is
Too much connection followed by rejections
Gonna hurt a girl 'til she learns her lesson

Tell me how many frogs do I have to kiss
Before I find my prince, before I find my prince

Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets

It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Why can't we be how we were in the backyard

And drawing our names in the sand
Somehow life just complicates
Our buried treasure it just waits

You're not climbing up my ivory tower,
So I'm comin' down for you,

In the dust that's on the car you drive
Droppin' hints can only get you so far,
When you don't know that I'm alive

How do you do?
I'm really pleased to meet you,
How do you do?
Gotta say it how I feel it,
Say it or I will,

When you're hanging at the point of stalement,
It's not the time to bite your tongue
So at the risk of looking really stupid,
I'm gonna take the plunge

While you let go, I hold too tightly
I take my aim, you hit the floor,

The unraveling, of a rope I put around me
You wont take no for an answer

It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about

Along the shore

Jumping head-first, head-long
Without a thought
To act and down the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I want to break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear, but not feel scared

Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to

People lie, people hide, people cry, people fight

And they don't know why
If fear is all that we should fear
Then what are we so afraid of
Cause fear is only in our heads

Someone please say'

[Chorus]

Any day ill go bad thinking bad
Everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
During my stressing I'm blinded to the lesson
That could be a blessing if Id be confessing that the enemy
I''m trying to beat is hiding inside of me

But it's ok now what are you worrying about

Keep your grind on girl it's your love, it's your world
Keep your grind on girl it's your love, it's your world

[Chorus]",Happy,2008
Natasha Bedingfield,"Whoa

I know you're trying to make me happy,
And I know you're doing it you're way, way.
And I don't always make it easy
To know the perfect words to say, say.

If you wanna give me what I want,
Listen, 'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

[Chorus]
When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right,
I want a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.
When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right,
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Ah, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're always trying to solve the puzzle,
And you always wanna fix what's broke, broke.
You keep searching through the rubble,
And never wanna let it go, go.

Sometimes it feels like I'm raining on the inside,
And all the things that I'm trying I don't get it right.
Yeah, sometimes, I fall but I get up,
And it takes a while but I get there in my own time.

If you wanna give me what I want,
Listen, 'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

[Chorus]

Love is a very wide open door,
You can go through every time you want more.
Why do I feel like the glass is half full,
When I've got enough of it to feel, a swimming pool.

Listen, 'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

'Til we're digging holes in the ground
We try but nothing is working
But still I want you around

Cause if I'm lost in the desert
I know somehow you'll find me
And if i drive in the ocean, you'll be
The first to rescue me

Everybody hurts just a little too much
Everybody hurts but its never enough
Its wonderful to fall
Its love and risk it all
I'd rather love just a little too much

Everybody hurts just a little too much
Everybody hurts but its never enough
Its wonderful to fall
Its love and risk it all
I'd rather love just a little too much

Natasha Bedingfield,"Everyday there's a thousand things
That somehow pass us by,
Go cut through the noise
So you can know what love sounds like
I'm comin' to your frequency,
To 106 point me
So there's no
Distractions

Take a breath
Take it in
Love has no expiration date
My heart will always beat for you
At a constant rate
It will outlast everything
You think is set is stone
It goes on and on and on and on,
On and on and on and on...

Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love

We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other

Oh it feels like...

Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?

Everyone is looking for a special connection
But it's like your compass points
A million directions
Do you need me to buy you
A telescope so you can see
How good
This could be

Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel me love?

Oh!

We got all the memories

Better than our first kiss

Oh it feels like...

Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?
(Can you feel it?)

And I'll wait for you
As long as it takes
Until I get through
And it hits you right in the face

Can you feel my lo-o-ove?
Can you feel my love?

Natasha Bedingfield,"Too many things go unsaid cause you think you can't say them right
Get them out in the open instead of all bottled up inside
Cause I don't mind if it comes out all emotional
And I don't mind as long as what you say is real
I know you're the kind of man who wants to show your best side
But we can't always be perfect, and that's alright
Don't over think it, you don't have to perform for me
You want to know how to touch me, well it's easy

Oh, it's like playing the piano
I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
You don't have to be a Mozart, if you just play it from the heart

Your fingers know just where to go
You don't have to be a Mozart, if you just play it from the heart

I know once something's been spoken aloud it can't be taken back
But don't be too proud, too proud to risk that
Between the tension the major and the minor chords
There's a magic we're waiting for, we're waiting for

I got a Mozart of my own
The way you're running up and down those keys
Sounds like a symphony to me

The worst is over, now.
All those fires we've been walking through,
And still we survive, somehow.

Got so much to lose,
Seems I've lost my power to choose, oh

When I tripped and spilled my coffee
On a man who yelled at me
And then walked off in a hurry

Now he's gonna be late for work
So he called his secretary
Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby

Who's been waiting for a while
And talking on the phone
Got invited to a party and thought he couldn't go

But he's here right now
Standing in my house
And someone turns the music loud

So we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Yeah we dance

'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us

I was planning out my party
Running errands 'round the city
Grocery bags full of alcohol
And chocolate chip cookies

Saw a dress that was amazing
In the window of a boutique
So I went across the street
Then my heel broke and it threw me

I tried to catch my balance
But I was 'sposed to fall
It seems that spilling coffee
Was no accident at all

'Cause you're here right now
Sitting on my couch
Funny how it all works out

Natasha Bedingfield,"Ring them bells, ye heathen
From the city that dreams,
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams,
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world's on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride.

Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow,
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know.
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells Sweet Martha,
For the poor man's son,
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one.
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep.

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through.
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
For the child that cries
When innocence dies.

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room,
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom.
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong.",Ring Them Bells [#],2012
Natasha Bedingfield,"Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
It's Christmas time
There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it so let's december it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be ok
And Santa Claus would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while
You can just give my grandma a smile
'Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
He can open some happiness with me

It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart 

But how many many many nights go by 
I sit alone at home and cry over you

Natasha K. Chandler,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",The Gazooka,2001
Natasha K. Chandler,"There was a day, there was a time
When I used to play
There was a time when I used to play
But take me now, baby, don't worry about later
Teach the dance I used to do
They call it the Mashed Potato

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk
Everybody relax and watch me work

In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

There was a time, sometimes I dance
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown",Maharanee,2001
Natasha Marsh,"The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song

But I miss you most of all

And eyes follow
Longing to touch
They want her so much
They stare

She speaks
And all listen
They so want to hear
She draws them all near
They care
They care

She laughs
Laughter follows
Like ripples follow a stone
In pools of fallen rain

She goes

And lights follow
Those who have stayed
See the moon fade
And go bare

With heart how long
When wherever she moves
My eyes follow
Her there

And day by day my love seems to grow

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

I put my tongue in her mouth, I make her pussy lips drool
She got that junk in the trunk, you know I like junk food
I tell her like this: life is good
Your pussy better, but I put on her magnum
I could go and melt her
And if it's sweeter, I'ma eat it till I get sugar diabetes
I'm her blood and she anemic we perfect!

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Qu'est-ce qui nous empêche de nous aimer tout le temps
De plonger dans la brèche qu'ouvrent les sentiments
Mais qu'est-ce qui nous empêche et de quoi ça dépend
Qu'est-ce qui nous empêche de nous aimer tout le temps
On échangera nos larmes
Et puis les mots qui passent
On trouvera d'autres armes pour faire face

I can stand my own ground
I can stand proud upon my own two feet
Don't have to be part of somebody else to be complete
What I really need comes from deep inside of me

Chorus

Don't need to come to you for confirmation
Because I've finally come to this revelation
What I really need I'm gonna find inside of me
Not in somebody else
Respect comes when you respect yourself

I don't need you to
Chorus

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty
To make me feel beautiful, no
Don't need you to lift me up
I can stand up on my own
Doesn't come from outside
This beauty, I know, comes from inside my soul

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty




",I Don't Need You To,2006
Natasha Thomas,"All I wanted was a little fun
Maybe just a little hit and run
I wasn't lookin' past the night
Love was the last thing on my mind

You came around and then you spun me out
Somethin' bout you really knocked me out
I didn't want to let it go
But you made me loose control

And now I'm fallin there's no way to stall it
I'm stuck inside a feelin'
That's so unreal
I try to hide it but I just can't fight it
Could this be the real thing
That's got me here

I don't what it is that you do
That makes me want you
You're just so damn irresistible
Feel a rush go through my body
And I can't break away
You're just so damn irresistible

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're just so damn irresistible

It's like emotional gravity
That makes me wanna get you close to me
I can't think of nothin' else
I don't wanna help myself

Makes me want you
Can't fight that
Kinda like that

Oh, holy shit

Does over mean it's over
Until we run into each other again?
On and off, hot and cold, back and forth
According to the mood we're in
We're back in bed again

We never seem to get to the end
We can't ever say never again
Tell me what does over mean?

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

I remember when over meant you felt
Real bad and cut up photographs
Never wanna see the son of a

Back with you again
Break up on a Sunday
Back on Monday
Ignoring everything that I said

We never seem to get to the end
We can't ever say never again
Tell me what does over mean?

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

We never practice what we preach
We're both guilty of being weak
Why say it's over when it ain't over?

Dysfunctionally raw
Emotionally backed up against the door
I don't trust us anymore
What's the meanin' of over?

Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again
Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again

Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again
Make up, break up, make up again
Tell me when it's over baby

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

Said it so many times
There's no reason, no rhyme
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

We'd share our problems and we'd call each other after dark

Reminiscing on my teens
A young G
Gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin' hard
If you never get tp play
I'm hustlin'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And comin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga rides
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' those thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G
 
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin' riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry

They won't worry me
Mama don't cry

More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed 
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafuckas gets born again

You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on tha rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
Will get me in some trouble
I'm tryin to ride 
No more loves 
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt
Or is a jury starts (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Pull me to my death
But I'm a G to tha enemy 

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin' riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin' riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' ta slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life payed tha price to be tha boss
Back in school
Wrote tha rules on gettin' tossed
Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine ?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me

Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot 
Never had no time for no bitch 
Instead slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs

I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep

Natasha Watkins,"Ultimatum, badman nuh tek ultimatum, 
Go wey, yuh haffi stay 

If I stay, would you put an end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go, 
This will be the final curtain of the show 
You have lost the best thing 
That you ever known 
Guess you have to learn 
To make it on your own 
Let me know stay or go 

Before you go let's analyze the situation 
I'm a typical Jamaican 
Why you layin' your frustration on me 
When we met it was a perfect combination 
But you know my reputation 
Don't know what you were expecting (of) me 
Fight back, you can fight 
Get things a go if yuh nuh like that 
Cause I know that 
When you (leave) you come right back 
Your new founded termination 
Sounds to me like desperation 
There's no ground for termination 

If I stay, would you put an end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today,

You have lost the best thing 
That you ever known 
Guess you have to learn 
To make it on your own 
Let me know stay or go 

I must admit I have a weakness 
For these women 
Who a plot like them a villain try the best 
To separate you from me 
I don't understand 
Just why the hell your cousin 
When you knew that she meant nothin' 
So what if she was your cousin 
You say fight back, 
How the hell could I resist 
When she's dressed like that 
Tell the truth I had to leave 
But she came right back 
Now you heard the explanation 
Taken to consideration 
It was sexual frustration 

If I stay, would you put a end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go,

Why your in a hurry to leave 
(Goodbye my darlin') 
See a lot I can't believe 
That this is happenin' to me 
(Goodbye my darlin') 
Yeah I know I made mistakes 
But this is meant to be 
(Goodbye my darlin') 
I promise I'll do better 
Baby stay with me 

If I stay, would you put a end

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

A song for the dreams woven in your room

Never take your future from my arms
I'll never let what we had turn bad
Or let you be sad

Sometimes I dream that we die young
Spend eternity beneath the summer sun
Spend the summers barefoot
Fly away for good

The moonlight is playing with my heart
Hopes and dreams are streaming upwards
The ephemeral beauty of transient days
We'll fly away

Mm.. sing that shit for daddy baby
Pump this motherfucker up.. richochet, ricochet
RICHOCHET (ricochet, ricochet)
RICHOCHET (yo homies, one two yo)

Mmm..
My style is too cold for words, it's like a bullet gone stray
Ease off, I'm bout to speak and hit the wall and ricochet
I rock the Cali way (for sure) I'm only in it to score
Niggaz say I'm owed one, but it's more like four
Hardcore entrepreneur, strainin like a champ
Rollin out in sixty-three's, that hop without a ramp
Young Tash Vamp'll kick your door in while you're snorin;
now where's that salt you was pourin?
I send the bullet soarin, yo ayy, let you slide?  No way
If you a -- ""Why do niggaz shoot?"" -- (""Alright, okay"" - Mos Def)
I gotta buck you down for that shit you was poppin
Now look how rotten the whole situation's gotten
Tash showed you love you shoulda showed me some back
If they catch me they gon' stretch me like Geronimo Pratt
Cause I gotta lay you flat no matter what you say
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

I tried to warn you killer, my rap style'll have you sprung
like a girl gave you head with a earring in her tongue
Since Tash come from less than zero, my splurgin's urgent
My mouth so foul, you couldn't wash it with detergent
My Likwit niggaz swervin, mergin, like a rally
Rearrangin niggaz grills like the '99 Denali
	Where the fuck we at Cali?  --  You motherfuckin right!
I want to see some action, burn somethin or fight
cause see it's Tash night tonight, it's Tash night tomorrow
I'm lookin for the hoes that got some sex I could borrow
I'll gladly pay you back next Wednesday the 3rd
(Why you laughin at me baby?)  That's my motherfuckin word
(word word word) Then it's words for nerds
Tryin to rap as fly as Tash is totally absurd
So everybody duck or catch the A.K. spray
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.

Newsflash on the screen, what the fuck does this mean?
It say, ""Tash is takin over the world, behind the scenes
Just drinkin beers spacin, Likwit sweeps the nation
But leave that man alone, cause you know his reptuation""
Brutalize the wicked world, I pump one verse of curse
to beat you down, beat you up, then take your girl or vice versa
You rap too commercial, you just cheat to compete
I done paid a gang of dues, I even kept the receipts
So you owe me homey, these corny niggaz outsold me
So write that blank check to Tash, the one and only
The only man standin when it's time for gunplay
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

or was she Lebonese? I think she Chinese
It really don't matter cause they all on they knees
It's something bout these motherfucking West coast G's
Make that cheese, when the cops come you bet' not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up
and leave you in a cell stuffed (damn!)
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck (f'real)
Trying to get a meal ticket and kick it
Chill, catch a plane to Spain or maybe Brazil
on the real can you feel me?

You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone

I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long

Just to figure out the reason why

I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door

ii She Gives Me Love
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford Dowling)
She gives me love
When love had gone away
When the pressure came so fast
She give me love
Long distance runaround
And in between the pressure
I was summoned

How did we dance on the south side of the sky
We saw the flags flying on the moon
And through the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you

She give me love
When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
the first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you

iii Who Was The First
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford)
Who was the first to show
The moon at night
Is never so far away
We are the first to define the
Languages of love

We are the first to discover
This day in our time

Re-writes itself eac",Quartet,1999

For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality

Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown 
It's the mischievous, lyrical genius on the loose 
and I pack the deuce deuce of some act right juice 
I'm in my own, space and time 
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind

Bottoms up, nigga give it all ya got

from this infectious enemy, they on the loose 
And unstoppable, Daz 
My motherfuckin nigga from back in the past 
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
with no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
with intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
Is this my boundary from county to county? 
Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
But uhh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin crew 
Now whatchu want to do? (Hmm, whatchu want to do? Yeah) 
Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin 
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin 
I gets to bustin (blaow blaow) you gets to duckin (blaow blaow) 
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin in the cut 
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em 
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents 
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one

Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick 
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
out of mind, somethin I wouldn't do without a nine 
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
Mashin all through the streets rollin wit some heat 
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
I'm on point and alert 
with skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
See me in black and beware 
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
Rage is knockin lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
with my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
faddle, dibble, dabble 
Gotta Rock like Fraggle

Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin

There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop
Have prestigious women 
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the fliest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind, 
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz

[Verse One]
Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys
It's 19-9-tre so let me just play
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre
But this time I'ma hit yo' ass with a touch
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin'
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearin' on the record
It's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-why, the D-O-double-G
I'm fly as a falcon, soarin' through the sky
And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie
I'm crazy, you can't phase me
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see
Every single day, chillin' with the D-O-double-G's
P-O-you-N-D that's my clique, my crew
Ya fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up

Ya want to get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill

Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic I'm hittin' hard as steel nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
How many hoes in your motherfuckin' group
Want to take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and really don't give a shit
About nothin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin' Dukes
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket loc
Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug

Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth

Met a girl
That I love

I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound

To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt

With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe

Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

Now I was about eight when I caught my first case 
My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace 
Now I didn't do a thing I was just standing by 
Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die 
Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home 
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught 
While walkin' to the cornerstore a big mistake was made 
My big homey I was walkin' with decided he needed to get paid 
So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store 
He said ""Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more"" 
Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke 
What I'm sayin' I ain't playin', it was funny til that nigga got smoked 
Can you guess who that could've been quite easily? 
But it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see 

[Chorus]
One more day, one more 
One more day 
One more day, one more 
One more day 

One more day, I'm hangin' around so I can see 
Little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy 
Everyday I'm sellin' big dope, it's all that I know 
I ain't workin' and I got a baby so don't axe me what for 
One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me 
I gotta another story about the penitentiary 
One more day, see while I was servin' cavi I forgot to think 
Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see 
Now remember I'm sellin' big dope but I'm packin' my thangs 
And every corner police watchin', I ain't crazy so I'm leavin' the game (I'm 
Leavin' the game) 
But I guess I waited too late 'cause they just caught me 
Now I'm locked up, every mornin' I am prayin' for my son's safety 
One more day, I'd like to thank you for watchin' over my D-O-double G's 
And would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially 
I guess I'll just continue liftin' from day to day 
And if I live to see tomorrow, thank you for one more day

Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the eats side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the two one to Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin' me I'm glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers and said, ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They gonna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I could fly let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me the Warren to the G

Just like I thought they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell I said, ""Ooh I like your style""

She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the East Side Motel

I'm tweaking onto a whole new era
G-Funk step to this I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level
The rhythm is the base and the base is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody G-Funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

	Well, America provided the atmosphere

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Gettin tired of mothafuckas sayin' ""Warren I told ya""
(You don't hear what I hear)
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggaz, ain't shit changin
Got my mama wonderin if I'm gang-bangin
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rollin with my niggaz
Off to the VIP, you see, Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that?
The nigga that's jackin, or the fool gettin' jacked (Yeah)

(Chorus)
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

Another sunny day, another bright blue sky -
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growin up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwin' up
And I knew it, There really ain't nothin' to it
Thinkin' every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back - (How Far?) Back in time
Draggin to these hookas tryin to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock (huh)
It was all so clear
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, then eighty-nine's the year
You say ""everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick""
Way back then two-one-three was the click
Somethin' to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

(Chorus)
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

You make me want to holler, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's servin' time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him n Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept sayin, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said, ""Snoop, things done change, it's not the same
We need to get about the game
'cause we can get paid in a different way
Wit you kickin' dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are gettin hectic, I just can't take it
Should I A: Go back to slangin' dope?
Or should I B: Maintain and try to cope?
Or should I C: Just get crazy and wild?
But no I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is gettin so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut?
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up?
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up?
Niggaz talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

(Chorus then fade)
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear

Verse One: Dat Nigga Daz 
Working LA 
tryin to get paid tha right way 
but somehow the right way don't pay 
I'm comin home late every night 
gotta struggle an fight 
wit tha baseheads on tha late night hype 
tryin to creep in tha house 
through tha cut 
for what 
so I won't be seen by none of the homies 
but tha homie Nate Dogg spots me 
and say Yo what's happenin 
No you don't know me no more 
when ya pass me tha satin 
I said ah naw it ain't like that G 
I'm trying to go straight 
and have a J-O-be	 
you need to quit that faggot ass job 
that's what he said 
showed me his grip and took some satin to tha head 
Damn that nigga had at least two G's 
and he was clockin it wit so much ease 
I told him I was gone so I'm headin in tha house 
everybody knocked out 
so I'm locked out 
I go back to tha front 
where my homies is hangin at 
they offer me a cabby sack 
so I can start slangin dat 
they say you ain't a hustler 
I say don't doubt it 
Hold dat thought 
and I'll think about it 
because 
Chorus: Nate Dogg 
[I've been dreamin to long, to long, to long] 
I don't like to dream about gettin paid 
Verse Two: Dat Nigga Daz 
The thought's complete so let me take a seat 
since I was born and raised on tha streets 
I quit tha job I had 
caught myself a sack 
went from a double of fifty into a ceno stack 
within a week but my peak wouldn't reach 
I was gettin too known on tha north side of Long Beach 
Niggas got to trippin and I thought I heard it 
so I went to tha hood 
on Twentieth and Murder 
I came up quick with some homies dat I knew from way way back 
and bid my sack 
or maybe it's seven 
or was it eight hundred strong 
In other words Daz had it goin on 
I bought myself a bucket 
That's right a bucket bitch 
who you fuck in my car on my dick 
My lifeself switched a bit 
but my attitude didn't 
I told all my old bitches good riddance 
'cause when you got money hoes come automatically 
and no hoes don't do nothing but cause some static see 
I went from khakis to guess braids to a fade 
I'm not Special Ed but I had it made 
livin tha life of a baller care free 
havin bitches dyin to sleep wit me ya see 
But I went bankrupt from all the spending and gamblin 
business was gettin slow 
and I wasn't handlin 
mine tha way I was supposed to 
Now I'm broke and on a jack mission 
so don't get close to 
tha D-P-G gang cause we scandalous when we broke 
We get tha doggs in in us 
we get ta actin like some 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Nate Dogg, Kurrupt 
Last night I had a dream 
felt so good it had to be 
me and my homies were gettin paid 
man oh man we had it made 
some homies want to roll wit me 
some homies claim insanity 
well if you want to set trip I will 
if you don't want to drop be still 
Damn 
I can't believe this 
but you can best believe this 
today 
I'm on another mission to get paid 
serve what I can serve right [right] 
so my pockets will stack up 
nigga don't trip 
nigga back up [hold up] 
I gots to react off the first impulse I find 
but my mama thinks I should take my time 
and work for mines 
but how much work would it take 
and how much money would I make 
wait 
there's somethin I gotta think about 
but I ain't got that much time 
moms want a nigga out tha house 
I ain't gettin no younger 
I'm only gettin older 
I'm only 
thinking about what my mama told me 
Now I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta for life 
and the fact that I'm out to get paid twice 
I ain't nuttin nice 
down to slang or pull a heist 
jack or break mutha fuckas on the dice 
That's real 
Now what should I do 
Just chill when it's time to peel caps and adapt to kill 
I've concealed tha concealed 
so I've maintained for tha salary 
and my mentally is raw from tha door 
I go hard from tha door

But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you",All Bout U,1996

We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes

I can talk about scandalous bitches

Oh I know you can!

Hey Daz, nigga stop fucking around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like, this here

I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no loving from my closest homies
Would of paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a player, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggas, player let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, ""Never breathing again""
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbing ass, trick
Used to watch you money grabbing, who you bagging bitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches looking scandalous

Scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous,she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

How's it hanging? Cause baby from the back the shit is banging
I've been stressing in this ghetto game, trying to do my thing
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissing
This bitch'll have ya waking up with all your cash missing
I'm asking, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're looking at a bitch who specialize in telling lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister Precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're going, she's making me come
I've been trained as a boss player, so what you saying?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous

Scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous,she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

Dangerous and ambitious, while scheming on getting riches
I'm spitting at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is begging for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinking you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggas doing time in the cell
I went from hell, to living well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm floating free on the highway, formulating plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous

Nate Dogg,"It's 12.30 AM, Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup
[Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of ""I Saw Mama Kissing Santa""
Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shout
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Bitch! (Bitch!)
I come through with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch
The riviera ever skaty, my team ya's the shit
Fifteen's humping, dropped the top, she moaned
counting my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side
We high, blazing like crazy, we don't know why
feeling good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world
they want to play wit their minds like little girls
I twirled my fingers in the air
rubbed my fingers through my hair
Red bones to black bones
dark bows to red bows
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
but I play hos like plenty-leany cause I get greedy
It's all about game 'cause when the game
is hard to maintain for so long, man
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma
Tonight ""warning the award is"" from Mississippi, I know ya
hold the key to unlock the door
From long clothes she rolls with gold things we riding for sure
So tell me how much money can one player make? (make)
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

I was off in Vallejo
pulling hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
being from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay
entrepreneur with my nigga D-A
Rockin tours and we still young boys
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

[Nate Dogg]
That's right
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya want to go a couple rounds with me
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy

[Warren G & Snoop Dogg]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound
'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you
down to the very last compound
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi
then turn on some Snoopy and, heat up jacuzzi
and later on I might just turn on a movie
so you can re-groupie and redo me just for Snoopy

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowing ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

I believe I got to see
We been making music since we were kids
Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will

I take it in stride I'm thinking negro league
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly

If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared 'cause I know I will
I think I can guarantee
You don't want to be standing next to me
Before my final curtain call
My mistakes they really won't be long
If we bump this in the streets
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go

Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jacking forever
I busting taking now bowing down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as the niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressing no guessing your profession
When the murder take place set yourself a tech 9

Your mother prayed for us both night and day 
I guess this is what she feared 
The picture in my room keeps your image sharply in my head 
All in my head 
I just can't let go of the memories I had; will this madness ever end?

Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be free or be in jail 
Incarceration at this time to me is better than heaven or hell 
I often wonder if you'd still be here if you had worn your vest.

If we don't change this mess... change it or we gone y'all

Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bulshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke

Runnin' kinda' late I gotta' catch my plane 
Feelin' kinda' funny from the weed and things
Kinda' glad I woke up so I can't complain
I really need a break from this paper chase
But my girl ain't gonna' wait for the diamond ring 
My son ain't got to wait for no proper clothes
So I'm gone take a trip and do a couple of shows
So many different things be runnin' through my head
It's mandatory that I keep my family fed
On come the stompin' boots and I'm out there again
Seems like this crazy pace is never gonna' end.

[Chorus]

I'm on a mission man, I'm fired up 
They let me taste it man 
And now I'm hooked 
Ain't nobody standin' on the wall
I bust the way I bust because the feel it y'all
People got opinions all about me y'all 
Got a lot of girls so they call me dogg
Constantly around me is friends and foes
Say the wrong thing bet I bust your nose
I gotta' give give it up to niggaroes
Even thought at times we fuck the same hoes
All the other niggas I'ma let you know 
Ain't no player hatin' go for what you know 
And if you see a girl that I'd like to lay 
Feel free to send her my way

[Chorus]

If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like. 
If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like.

And we can do it all night 
I bet I hit it just right

Nate Dogg,"[Chorus]
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

Constantly we mash

If this were my world (if this were my world) my world
If this were my world (if this were my world) my world

If this were my world you know what I'd do
Take a million dollars out the bank, would you
Give a half a million to the chronic man
Yes I would do it, cause I can
If this were my world you know who I'd screw
All the motherfuckers that be screwin' you
Not that I'm trying to get elected man
I would set trip because I can
If this were my world the holidays would be
One for famous black folk and one for me
Just in case you don't know who I be
Make a holiday for the g-funk king
If this were my world things would go my way
Every single day I'd have one more day
And if ever anybody got in my way
All I can say is first we pray - first we pray

If this were my world you could bet I'd clown
Have a mini mansion in every town
Fan mail comin in from all around
Asking me where did I get that gangsta sound
If this were my world it would only be me
Standin' on the top of the industry
Bouncin' like a baller over tight-ass beats
Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me
If this were my world everyday there'd be
Another young brother claimin' d.p.g.
Raised from the gutter taught to make money
Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see
If this were my world I'd take my gangsta name
Set it at the top right next to fortune and fame
Finally I got myself up out of them chains
If they lock you up don't let 'em capture your brain

[Chorus]

If this were my world, you now what I'd do
Buy me a spaceship and a condo on the moon
If this were my world, I'd have a low low crew
We'd go roll your hood and do what gangstas do

They tell me that temptation, ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, I tried to hide my feelings, d-o-g's
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)

I've traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing I really want you to do

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)

Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real g's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be macking
I can't lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, ok
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone

A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone ""what's happenin'?""
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking silver satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney motherfucker that they call kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some gin in his cup

Now I found myself blowin' out smoke 
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of the hoes

Yeah nigga
2Pac in this motherfucker

All my homies drinkin' liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch don't wanna die, then, don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends, damn!
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me?
How long, will they mourn my brother (Half them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me?

How long, will they mourn my brother (yo nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on, yo Syke)

How long will they mourn me?
Every motherfuckin' day homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me?

I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
How long will they mourn me?
How long, will they mourn, my brother (It's still on nigga)

Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad
I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin' watchin' my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace, how long will they mourn me?

We know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome
You only live once on this earth a nigga had it bad
Since the day, of my motherfuckin' birth (uh)
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will ya mourn me?

[Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Snoop (Daz): 
Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times]

shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P,

The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking

Trying to set me up at the park

Act a fool

And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game

I got a little boy to see through
And him without me 
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle 
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this

So um, leave that back door open 
so a nigga can come in there real slow.

You got a job, I got a life, you got a man, I got a wife
Baby girl, baby boy, that's the way of the world
It ain't got back, can't get back
You say it won't get back, shit I hope it don't get back
I'm creeping with you, sleeping with you
It's getting bad on a nigga, now I'm beeping you too
And meet me at the hot spot and work that skirt
You know the blue one, the new one, girl you know the truth hurt
Heart beating while I'm cheating, trying to catch a nut
Bad little bitch got a nigga caught up
I'm sliding in the rag top Chevrolet
Got a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A.
I'm trying to find your granny's house, is your auntie house
Well um, you know we sorta kinda burn it out
You know I turn it out whenever I'm in the mix

G'd up, boot up, to hit it and show
I give it to you real baby, can't (shake em up dogg)
Jump in the Burg, let's swirve on the low key
Windows tinted cause everybody know me
You told on Mause, you told on Snoop
And now you wanna tell on me, well woopty woop
Put me up on game, your homie
It was too much fun, hm, remember what you told me

No baby I ain't with the bullshit
I been fuckin you for two weeks and I ain't seen no cashflow increase
You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Yay kiss and a rub back and now I'm up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that hoe squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that hoe
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself
The nigga you was with man he rich as hell
Even though this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell

I parlay with my friends

Rather be buried, then see us party

Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies

Nate Dogg,"Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body",Big Pimpin',2000

Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone

Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell

Lieutenants, bosses, block monsters, kingpins
Funkin', beefin', killin' they best friends
And to prevent bloodshed we used to try to reason
But right now it's a drought and ain't nobody eatin'

So therefo' there the problem right there
Ain't no jobs provided so I'ma blame the Mayor
Sinister mob throughout the town
Y'all grew up on this shit, y'all love the sound

y'all threw up on the shit, all on the tar
Got you twisted with the shit, dang near wreck yo' momma's car
Dirty needles, welfare checks
Poverty, despair, housin' projects

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

Smeb with me and Nate Dogg
M.D. 20/20 see that them breathin' alcohol
Drinking too many to the head with me
Eightball, let your anger out, throw it up against the wall

I dropped a see-note, didn't miss it
A little skank from the other side, picked it up and kiss it like
Good luck, you deserve it and you makin' it
Even though my boyfriend, them be hatin' it

I'm a top hat, them cats is mouses
I sport ice, cost mo' than niggaz houses
I'm nothing close to bein' fake
I tried to tell them tricks a long time ago
To get in this rap game, but it's too late

I'm on my way to my, where? Studio session
Switchin' ears, tryin' to get a better reception
Changin' gears, super size
Poppin' wheelies in my brand new ride

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

Glow in the dark night vision, solar ray tinted glass
Power heated side through mirrors, brought back airbags
Off the new with the stump
My Cadillac DTS Deville, 32 valve ain't no punk

Get up outta here some ol' Jacklin and square
Hollered adjitudes and ate the gravel
I said, ?I ain't no mark ass any ol' rapper
Potnah I was built for battlin'

And about all that ol' jaw jackin'
You doin' potnah, I ain't playin'
You get your head put on flat,
Think it's a game, I got choppers

Done fucked with jelly jaws
Screwed a few bitches in my car
A temper problem, I can't hide
Issues, violence, problems deep inside?

Although them niggaz is tight
As tight as me they never will be
So what? Some niggaz is famous man
Some niggaz is out for they G's

Some niggaz is lovin' hookers man
Some niggaz send hoes to they knees
Some niggaz will rescue a bitch
Some skanless niggaz'll let the ho bleed

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

Nate Dogg,"Yeah, one for the treble
Two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and played my game
My own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thing
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and their whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When ya'll was askin' permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
'Cause in a minute there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gays is too short to see it
But when their face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent
Or dirty like the 7-1 precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evening
You keep on scheming, making me some more reasons
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than ya'll cause I'm smarter than ya'll
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering ya'll
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than ya'll
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens salute (they know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages and wackness, foul rats is blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug,
But go two ways without Skytell pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A.
More beef then deli's
Thus what I vent is just, what you lust to vent is irrel'
Halleluja, Pharoahe marching through ya
Maintain the same frame of mind school ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'ma quit the rip ya reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dose is just leaving you mentally unfocused here
Emcee's just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on ""catch a beat down""
Don't be hesitant sound cracks to sediment
It's evident we're medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's definite when I'm in it
All window's is tinted, how you seeing me when I'm in it
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's slows blows shows like afros
We hate ya'll though
That's why Nate Dogg goes

Oh no

Rrrah, uhh, bitch!
It's radio radio station, cat Xzibit huh?
K-W-Balls, Daniel Thompson hold like this

I'm takin caller number one, that is..
Rrrah uhh, bitch - you took too long
Caller number two like this..

{*BZZT*} Bounce up out of the house close to midnight
Full rack up in the back {*BZZ BZZ*} shit is tight
Full charge and I'm out for somethin
Mass production, Battlecat bang percussion
End of discussion, hittin some corners, rearrange thangs
and brang change, we expand California
Listen - I lost more than I can ever gain back
from this road to riches, makin my heart turn black
So I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back
Plus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat
Get your, shit together nigga Big Snoop Dogg told me
'Do music and leave that other shit alone homey'
We came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch
y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with us, and plus
it ain't nothin like standin on your own two
So run them streets, but never let 'em run you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Time is steady wastin, steady wastin
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin
I'll bust 'til I'm deceased, yeah, wooo-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh

Tune in, witness the rise of a icon
The python wrap around 'til your breath gone
The upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on
and want to squeeze 'til my life is gone?
Back to the wall and trust nobody
Sippin Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti
Somebody gotta recognize this
Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist
Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists
Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists
You just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this
Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List
Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse
the niggaz that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?
Metaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah)
It's been a long time, where the gangstas at?

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Damn it feels good to be back in the saddle
On top of the game, crackin the frame, the heat of the battle
Been a long time comin but we waited
Xzibit went from bein hated, to makin the whole world say it
Give a fuck if the radio play it
Niggaz fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it
It ain't about who you are when you're makin your stack
It's the look that's on your face when you givin it back
So picture that

Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend aint knowin
That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like ""what's up trick"" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I,  got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw

Whoa, not these niggas again

Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me

Nice sack of chronic with some gin in a cup 

Back up I stack up the weed 

Tha Pound and the Row is my only friends

To the fullest feeling I'm feelin you never could feel 

While your mind is comin where your body is chill

Not flaggin, not saggin, but havin a ball 

Yo, saw y'all motherfuckers want to see like doggs

It's like one to the two, two to the three 

K to the you-are-you-P-T 

In fact, I steps with a tech in the back 

In the hood, ain't got no love, so I packs a strap 



And I once knew a nigga named Dr. Dre 

He was a baller from the motherfucking CPT(a baller from the CPT) 

He hooked up with the niggas from the LBC 

And now they fuckin up the whole rap industry

Remember, I'm murderin niggas as a hobby 

Bodies get battered for fuckin with the best dogg dump

Who you tryin to provoke(nigga) step up, get smoked nigga 

Get the strap in the back I'm rollin and a bumpin 

Niggas talk shit I won't write and start dumpin 

Uh, who play the role like the G's 

Punk ass middle fuckin mark niggas, please 

Murder in the first degree 

I step with a tech, burst and flee 

You'll find none worst than me 

See, motherfuckers murdered and mangled, strangled 

Our bitches like a bangled 

Take ya from a whole different angle 

Bitches, I'm never sympin, You'll see me pimpin 

I step the clip in, bust a cap 

Watch them fall flat on they back 

Like this and like that from an automatic strap 

So for tryin the techno

Oh, so I'm headed out the door 



Now as I roll with Kurupt and my cousin Eastwood 

On a mission up to no good 

We don't love you bitch 

After we finish diggin 

Tha Pound's about that dollar and takin no shit 

>From the busta ass niggas, Bell it out shit

One time can't trzzzace, now why you punk twice 



Now, you've been sleeping on the desk for a long time 

Waitin for the nigga to come bust a dogg rhyme 

So motherfuckers throw your hands in the air 

And get your proper groove on like you don't care 



See I don't love them hoes

Keep my mind on my money, that's just how my money flows 

And so

Would the police still gap em', pass em'

And keep my foot out his motherfucking asshole

Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told

Love what your body does to me
On me, asking me, off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
Fuck then fall asleep, locking for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, now

[Chorus 1]
Baby if we got together again
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You're never gonna let me go baby

Promise I will be by your side
I'll be everything you need to get by
What I broke you know we finally mend
Baby if we got together again

[Nate]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait
And if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby, what would you do?

What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)
Baby if we got together again (why me?)

[Ja Rule]
Why would you want to go through the pain?
The loving another name
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame
We can't even get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit, the flesh is weak
But the game is strong
We go my way, your way baby, we moving on
It's true, goin' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

[Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]
I never thought (baby there's nothing to lose)
Thought I'd be (you know my soul's so cold)
Without you (and my love is pain)
By me (spit it one more time)
I never thought (my baby)
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
By me (no doubt, whoa)

That parade in blue and yelling 'cause
(Whats up? 'Cuz)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love

These days still the same
I can steal the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change

So fuck whoever in the fame, forever a man
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude

Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disaprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

I can see us smashing up the shore past laws that's lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust, TV screen, DVD, e-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin', I'm on the next tail

Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Mya Landske
Bulletproof, emotint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, Afghani sense
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage

Like wintergreenmint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor, staple center chick
Next to Denzel and Nicholsen, Phil Jackson whistlin'

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars with our nephews

Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing and ain't worried about a damn thing

But man, that's the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, that's how Hollywood pays

Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla
(Holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo?

I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude hoe
Oh, you know how that shit go
Or give when cats get fed off the four or fifths

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun

I want to do some nasty thangs, want to make her scream my name

Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime

Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, what's goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth

So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right

I heard that true
Make things go up an' down
I heard that's true

I been through the full court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine, the first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet
Down solid mashin' on top of concrete

Before all the ways of war
House an' car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
An' we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986

It's all about lics, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts, worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy, just worn all night

Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest hoes
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin' an' layin' some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
An' I'm walkin' on this earth like I don't give a fuck

An' now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
An' corrupt my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
An' back the fuck up with that buck free style

Nigga, what freestyle, nigga?
Walkin' on a razor blade
Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid, sunny California, baby

I got subs in my trunk an' it's bound to bump

Anythin' a hooker do, it won't amaze me

Another type of brother I don't want with me

And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay

And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft

Where go the blaze at?
That's right, yeah
Ride with me, yeah
Walk a block with me
On the heist with me
Represent with me
Yo, ride with me
Walk a block with me
On the heist, with my heist with me
Represent, yo

When I wake up in the morning, when I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler, at all times I be chasing my bread
Since this one's for my people, I'ma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly, daddy say aim for the head
I think we all to cool to lose it, I say we all stay leveled instead
I say still we tame the hookers, I know we still eluding them feds
We make this one for the Negroes, and for the Caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

[Chorus]
When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out my bed
I will always be a hustler
I will always chase my bread
Since this one's for my people
I'ma make sure you hear what I said
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head

Yo, I wake up late but still got currency
Dreams, snooze button no I'm trying to sleep
I got bill and the ends ain't trying to meet
So I'm pressed for cash and I'm out of my league
Ya' see, times ain't the greatest and I ain't Ali
So my hours are nine to five and my job's the street
I'm in a low position trying to hope these mission
Crenshaw when exposition feeling holiday wishin'
And the block West stat and the spot we sure have
Rallies on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right

[Chorus]

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine
I leave 'em comatose falling asleep

Mr X to tha Z
Yeah, Warren
LA indo, gangster and mack mo
Bullets at your window, dangerous

Ruthless, hostile, unforgiven, who gave you permission
To try to stop me from livin', huh? Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack, it's two thousand and two

My backpack raps got my backpack
Strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pravda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck

Shakin' and dancin'
Y'all takin' pills, we takin' penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit' it

When I say that I'm wit' it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon' get me acquitted
G's is walkin' out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin', the faggot had it comin' to him

Warren G

What y'all thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin' that Sherman shit
I learnt this from the best that got y'all sprung
The, the doctor Andre Young

Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Goin' hard on the yard till my dogs bail me
They tells me I can't proceed wit' it
I came back and got Warren G wit' it

West coast, still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no, don't pretend, oh no
I woulda came but I was dead broke, no mo
I'm rollin' on some real, oh no

'Bout to get it, but niggas trip though, let's go
I'm the realest and they all know real dope
You need a filter or you will choke, indo
That's all a nigga will smoke, oh no

Now, niggas better get between their door, door
I'm shakin' all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it

Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin' like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin', Shiest never stoppin'
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now

I'm feelin' funny in the tummy
And a nigga ain't been eatin' for weeks, I'm sick
I ain't trying to get no better but rather
Infect the world leavin' Vicks in a old sweater

Knoc's landin', tell me if it ain't me, who got the best planin'?
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin'?
Who gots your undivided attention?
Who makes your panties wet, girl?

Hold up, pause, which nigga on TV
That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin'
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin' my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock

Through my peripheral vision, I watch subconsciously
Waitin' to introduce you to tragedy see it's Knoc's landin'

Get it Crip while the gettin is good

I don't need that, I don't believe that
E'rybody gon' get hurt, if I do dirt
I flirt with the idea of quittin' the game
Nah!!  I'ma evolve continue to change
It take brains, balls and backbones to get it on
and keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own
So I spit about it, whatever I feel about it

Win time after time 'til there ain't none left
Hardhat, punch the clock, back to work
I'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt
everybody and anybody who come to my party
like they ready to get roudy and touch somebody
Who's that nigga y'all came to see? ""X!""
Often imitated, but cannot be, ""X!""
What's next, collect respect like paychecks
Straight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex

It ain't shit changed.. we gon' bang like this
And I'm drinkin this fifth, we still don't take no shit

I got a ""Sixth Sense,"" that tells me you ain't worth six cents
I'm sick with my sixth sense
Whattup Doc?  I'm gettin down to business
Crooked ass the cops to the Rampart district
Loose yourself in the music, move it or lose it
Abuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the
next man, it's the X Man rollin
Stand firm, solid as the ground I'm holdin
Make mine Golden, permanent State issue
Stacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu
Long range missile, if we got issues
I'ma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you
I'ma keep swingin 'til the medics come get you

To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now

You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit
I struggle for survival
And now you trying to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
All the pain, all the agony
All the horror, all the tragedy
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life, c'mon

I could of snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you

Nate Dogg,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up

'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

To see the places we lived, long conversations
We talked of old friends and all the things that we did
Summer nights, drunken fights
Mistakes we made...did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life I swear the happiest day of my life

You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it,
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

'Cause you know I know you
Yeah, I know you

Last time I saw you, you was brewed up, booed up
Ready for a new fuck, last time you saw me
I was P I to the motherfucking M P, what
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch
Livin' in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb
And I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga' rocks, bail a nigga' out but
She tried to plot on a nigga'
Vacant lot, one shot, bitch died, go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Fuck's wrong with this nigga' man?
He used to bring through the hood
Treat the bitch to fuckin' good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch
Faded off the lick, she x-rayed the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on suck shit
Meanwhile in the hood, she drivin' around good
This bitch thinks she in Hollywood
Meantime she settin' the nigga' up
Tellin' us, what his stuff
She's ready to get him stuck, what

Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady
(That's what I know)
Sex on her mind, all the time
And you think that that's your baby
(You don't know)

You a good guy that's livin' a lie
But she dove and played your safety

If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me?

We had to ride on a nigga'
Watch him for the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was
Run up on him, forty-five in the ribs, what
This nigga' screamed like a bitch
Showed us what his shit hit her
Hell of a lick but the bitch
Who told us 'bout the bricks
Exposed us to the nigga'
He knew that we'd come
But meanwhile in his hood
His niggaz is suitin' up
And Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man, 'Livin' It Up'
Then a van with no hubs
Suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga', the fuck up
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched
It's like a rush, the bitch who blushed
And smoked blunts wit us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up wit the wrong slut
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggaz got my back, in fact they caught
On her Ave, flossin' in another nigga' cab

Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady
(That's what I know)

And you think that that's your baby

This funk is for them rowdy niggas liable to shank ya
A cock back blast, wit no questions asked
So just, hold tight, don't let the liquor run your whole night
Don't let a sucker into courage fuck up your whole life
I play the cut and analyze the view
Push up my glass just to acknowledge the chosen few
Cause I don't fuck wit many
Especially the tough ones off a glass of Henny
Especially the ones always frontin' that don't have a penny
I run wit niggas that demand respect
And I'm a boss bitch, most y'all can't handle that
All you can do is watch your glide
It take a special type 'a nigga 
'Bout something that can stop a stride
Cause I can't respect a nigga that's soft
And I bet y'all never seen it comin'

I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some pretty ass eyes

I need me a bitch so I can floss that hoe and make my ex mad
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie
I need me a bitch so when I do some dirt she be my alibi
I need me a bitch, like I need a 6-4
I need me a bitch that'll shine my rims up and open my door
I need me a bitch, who is all of that
I need me a bitch 'cause I'm a fly ass mothafuckin' nigga who was born to mac
I need me a bitch, like neva before
I need me a bitch and I couldn't care less if the bitch is yours
I need me a bitch

I gotta fuck wit cheeks, got a house up on the beach
Everyweek she call me just to beat up the peach
'Til she reach a climax, scratches on my back
Hit it from the back, baby told me she like that
Infact, you the first one to make it feel right
I knew she wasn't lyin', knew the cat was real tight
And afta tonight, you gone remember me
Armed Robbery, put my love up there where your liver be (Haha)
I told her never speak on me (Damn)
'Less ya want your burnt out friends ta creep wit' me, go ta sleep wit me
I hit her frequently, take them women off the chain
Can duck game, eva see the bitches run the train (Uh-uh)
It ain't the same (Uh-uh), afta I knock it out the frame
You wonder why just now ya start gettin' brain
I knock 'em out, pull chickens wit'out a doubt, fo' clout
Ask Nate Dizzal what I'm all about

I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I need me a bitch, who ain't hard ta please
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some sored up knees
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared ta flirt
I need me a bitch in the middle of the grocery store she'll lift up her skirt
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch I love when she wallin' out 'cause she still look fly (Fly)
I need me a bitch, and a Coup Deville
I need me a bitch a car with a big back seat so I can make her squeal

[Nate Dogg]
They tell me that temptation, oh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, i tried to hide my feelings, d-o-gs
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to, but I don't even know what it is
You've got me singing in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
Ill ask you one time only, baby, wont you be there when its hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
Ive traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think Id make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna then what you gonna do
I guess Ill call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing Id really like for you to do

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
A'm mobbing through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just trying to handle mine
Spitting game at the homies about the good ol days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
Its true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real gs gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But whats the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in Id probably be macking
I cant lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of player hood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is tripping she got a block on the phone

And we don't kick it but bust it and khaki jeans strains
I'm done movin' I'm clearin' the crowd
It's the who bangin' bandanna cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

[Mack 10]
Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you plain homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunner's
It's real with us partna, dealers and drug runners
And Mack need a** in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than the South Central L.A. summer, let's go

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
What the hell is Ice Cube talkin' about
That's how you get these here parked in you mouth
Westside ride trick, the same old spit
I don't conversate with chicks I ain't goin' hit
I don't holla at these pros that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (uh)
You kinda but I'm with so my Andre got to be bomb rate

[W.C.]
Have you seen us, naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est n****
Countless calls and countless charges
Street n****s makin blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas sip notic by the liters
With a flock of pros on us cause the chronic is
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bagin' for the whole G Nation n****

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the be	 in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't bow like me
Cause I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin' for the hood causin havic and ruckus
You fools actin' label kissin' up like suckas
And your trick solder down when you pee lil' bustas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
Look check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation goin' down over here
So ya'll might as well bow down
And join this Westside thang man
Cause once you get with this
Partna you as G as can be
Believe that homeboy
It's like that
Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit

[Nate Dogg + (Ice Cube)]
This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

Nate Dogg,"There's not much you could do or say to phase me 
People think I'm a little bit crazy 
I get it from all angles, even occasionaly
Doc Drezy'll have to step in every once in a while to save me 
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things 
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think 
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me 
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me 
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy 
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times 
'Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem 
like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing 
And I could give a fuck what category you place me 
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone 
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me 
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me 
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me 
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me 
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me 
It only made me what I am today, see 
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
You ain't gonna make or break me 
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G 
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening 
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me 
You had all this time to think about it 
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me 
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day 
That we finally meet in the same place to see 

No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many MC's I end up 
Oh, it's never enough 

No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many MC's I end up  
Oh oh, it's never enough 

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it 
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics 
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split 
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it 
My spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit 
Graze it, your peace talk, save it 
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated 
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers 
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse 
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy? 
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it 
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic 
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it 
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate 
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it 
When it's hot, it's hot 
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it 

No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many MC's I end up

Nate Dogg,"Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And, it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas, or over trust them
yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't escape the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waiting on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

Hey yo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from ""Blow"", let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fucking with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over

Nate Dogg,"Hahahaha, man, you crazy

See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby

In Iraq it's innocent kids dying from missiles

(Alright there ah buddy license and registration
Uh officer is there a problem man what's going on?
(Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
What's that?
(An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
You know how fast you were going?)
Nah not at all man
(you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
Keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel 
Yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers)

[Fabolous]
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
Or the 22's underneath me
That's keeping them sirens flashing on my ass
Should I get to pumping the brakes or mashing on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked, but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashing wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life, I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's following me
Asking for my ID who's car I'm driving
Po Po's bothering me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't want to set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fucking with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Every time they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face asking for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they asking
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passing
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doing shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye, no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes want to stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's want to frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfucking po po'

I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips, to stick up in the are's
Detectors in the dash, to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hitting superman's chest, nigga

Nate Dogg,"Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
Get my hustle on

[Ludacris]
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growing up and seeing life at it's worst
Then trying to iron out my wrinkles, putting family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinking my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be staying afloat
And I admit to being caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battling with myself and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta things that ain't none of my biz
And just cause something looks don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
Is from the ground up a hundred miles and running
Dodging and ducking everybody trying to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothing still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Trying to get in where I fit, streets giving me hell
But yet I give it right, back, so how you like, that
Continue doing wrong 'til I was on the right, track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a push
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good

Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Living life on the cutting edge, taking a stab at it
And learning from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admitting when I'm wrong, trying hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people getting stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds trying to pass the sky
Never blinking for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They want to catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringing so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm making changes turning glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yourself and it's so simple to grow
Come on

Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'

You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it, 
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Chorus]

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet

Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up

Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish

Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's

Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Park the GT Bentley and pull out the Phantom Rolls,

So my stash box enclosed with Fo'Fo's and calicos,

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on
N A T E and me
The Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""

I think we all to cool to lose it, I say we all stay leveled instead
I say still we tame the hookers, I know we still eluding them feds

But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be

Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me

Ah, I wear the same khakis for about four days
And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang
PCR, Dogghouse when I bang, and I'm out, nigga

[Chorus]

[Yukmouth]
What? Nigga, ery'thang, ery'thang..
Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Are you real motherfuckers, for real motherfucker?
Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch
I'm somethin you don't wanna fuck wit
I'm the nigga wit the pistol, launchin six from the clip
I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga
Nate, Yuk, Kokane, Kurupt we back nigga
Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit
What up pretty mama, a.k. pretty bitch
This Kurupt, I know you fucks to get rich
I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K
Kurupt, the analytical, phenonomal, the most anticipated
Highly hated, top graded
Ig'nant than a motherfucker, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]



",So Ignorant,2005
Nate Dogg,"G:
Regulators
We regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street,
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, 
Earn your keep!
Regulators! mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren g was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the eastside of the lbc
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren g.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with two one three

So I hooks a left on the 21 and lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate dogg and warren g had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on
N a t e and me
The warren to the g

Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the g-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the eastside motel

I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-funk
Step to this
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the g-funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
Two one three will regulate",Regulate [*][Multimedia Track],2006
