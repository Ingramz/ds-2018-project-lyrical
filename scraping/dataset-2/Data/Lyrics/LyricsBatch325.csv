Graham Bickley,"Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for
Its prey!

You have come here
In pursuit of
Your deepest urge,
In pursuit of 
That wish,
Which till now
Has been silent,
Silent...

I have brought you,
That our passions
May fuse and merge - 
In your mind
You've already
Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -
Now you are here with me:
No second thoughts,
You've decided,
Decided...

Past the point
Of no return -
No backward glances:
The games we've played
Till now are at
An end...
Past all thought
Of ""if"" or ""when"" -
No use resisting:
Abandon thought
And let the dream
Descend...

What raging fire
Shall flood the soul?
Which rich desire
Unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
Lies before
Us...?

Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold - 
What warm,
Unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return...

CHRISTINE
You have brought me
To that moment
Where words run dry,
To that moment
Where speech
Disappears
Into silence,
Silence...

I have come here,
Hardly knowing
The reason why...
In my mind,
I've already
Imagined our
Bodies entwining,
Defenceless and silent -
And now I am
Here with you:
No second thoughts,

I've decided,
Decided...

Past the point 
Of no return - 
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...?

BOTH
Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
The bridge
Is crossed, so stand
And watch it burn...
We've passed the point
Of no return...

PHANTOM
Say you'll share with
Me one
Love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me
From my solitude...

Say you want me
With you,
Here beside you...
Anywhere you go
Let me go too - 
Christine,
That's all I ask of...

Done this...?

You! Why did you let this happen?

Are.

But can I trust you?

GIRY

The level of your eyes!

But why...?

Why? The Punjab lasso, monsieur. First
Buquet. Now Piangi.

Like this, monsieur. I'll come with you.

No, Meg! No, you stay here!

Shall be too late",The Point of No Return,2002
Graham Bickley,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye [From Sunset Boulevard],2002
Graham Bickley,"Whistle down the wind
Let your voices carry
Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The tears and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you 
My precious friend

So try and stand the time
Then your ways abandon
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch

And try to build a bonfire
Every signal that you send
Until the very end out there
So whistle down the wind
For I have always been right there

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The tears and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon
You my precious friend

Try and stand the time
Then your ways abandon
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch

And try to build a bonfire
Every signal that you send
Until the very end out there
So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there",Whistle Down the Wind [From Whistle Down the Wind],2002
Graham Bickley,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart
As now they do, then

Younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Am I with you",Younger Than Springtime [From South Pacific],2004
Graham Bickley,"When I was a kid, I played on this street
I always loved illusion
I thought make-believe was truer than life
But now it's all confusion

Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for?

If you were smart, you would keep on walking
Out of my life as fast as you can
I'm not the one you should pin your hopes on
You're falling for the wrong kind of man

This is crazy, you know we should call it a day
Sound advice, great advice
Let's throw it away

I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I haven't got a prayer
If I'm a fool, well
I'm too much in love to care

I knew where I was, I'd given up hope
Made friends with disillusion
No one in my life, but I look at you
And now it's all confusion

Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for?

I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see, way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face

I should hate you
There I was, the world in my hand
Can one kiss, kiss away
Everything I planned?

I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I'm floating in mid-air
I know it's wrong, but
I'm too much in love to care

I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face
This is crazy, you know we should call it a day

Sound advice
Great advice
Let's throw it away

I can't control all the things I'm feeling
We're floating in mid-air
If we are fools, well
We're too much in love to care
If we are fools, well
We're too much in love to care",Too Much in Love to Care [From Sunset Boulevard],2004

Don't let go, Don't let go.
Come on, baby, it's time to rock,
Don't let go, Don't let go.

Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

Hound dog barkin' up side the hill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Love is draggin' him thru the mill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
If it wasn't for havin' you,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'd be barkin' and howlin' too.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

One day, baby, you'll quit me yet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'll be cryin' and soakin' wet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
One thing, baby, I'll never stand,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Your lips kissin' some other man.

Just hold me tight, Don't let go!",Don't Let Go,1999
Graham Bonnet,"Oh
Come to me baby, I got something to say
I've been changing your direction every step of the way
I bring you motion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire

Graham Bonnet,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,1977
Graham Bonnet,"Ten little Indians standing around
I bet there are many but how would I know
As she was only one woman
Only one woman

And I've got a picture

Who sees my lonely face, who sees my shame
Nobody in my place, can tell me her name

'Cause she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

Ten little Indians, now there are none
I bet there are many, but her love still goes on

Graham Bonnet,"Darlin' darlin' 
If I could have you to call my very own 
I work my fingers to the bone, I am alone 
To you I'd always come home 

'Cause there's something about you, baby 
That makes me keep loving you 
There's something about you, baby 
Makes me love you just a little bit more 
Truly does, just a little bit more

Graham Bonnet,"He's just a kid and loves to ride
Taking the freeway, driving blind
Just like a loaded gun, he pushes down the hammer
Hard to fire

In the embrace of his gasoline lover
Her sleek body wraps all around
Turns on the radio, lights up his cigarette
Takes the lights up, dims them down
A silent Geisha, the perfect seducer
Knows someone is waiting too long

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh please say you'll be there

He's just a kid who loves to drive
To get out of sight out of his mind
He pushed the hammer down
And shot just like a bullet from a gun

Drunk on the fix of the powerful kick
As he shoots up from zero to speed
Has one more drink of the cold liquid courage
To keep on the level he needs
Soothed by the sound of the wheels on the ground
But he won't hear the tires when they scream

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh will you be home tonight

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh will you be home tonight",Will You Be Home Tonight,1995
Graham Bonnet,"Lets take a plane and go somewhere exotic
To play with a non-descript song
We'll shoot all the crotch shots for 12 year old hopefuls
To make you a real man my son

Some cheap kid from Birmingham
Blessed with an accent
That pours like the darkest brown ale
Just one more puppet, piss elegant marionette
He's just a fast buck for sale

Don't you know that God blessed video
We know that God blessed video

Break out the cameras that re-shape my face
And get someone to carve up my hair
If you can't beat them, you might as well join 'em
And be glad to say you were there",God Blessed Video,2017
Graham Bonnet,"It was newborn and ten feet tall,
But they called it little boy,
And C7, H5, O6, N3 they called him
T-N-T.

The fireball would dim the sun,
Promising death in its cruelest form.

Hiroshima Mon Amour
As we beg to be forgiven do you spit,
In our face and curse us all.

The fireball that shamed the sun,
Burning the shadows on the ground,
As the rain falls to dry the land,
Leaving desert for the thirsty man.

They all said it would end the war,
And we thanked Christ for the bomb,
And the priests and witches all agreed,
They should die to keep them free.

The fireball that shamed the sun,
Burning the shadows on the ground,
As the rain falls to dry the land,
Leaving the desert for the thirsty man.

Graham Bonnet,"Just one more of those 82 nights
We were all cowboys ready to ride
Fire the gun, turn your eyes to the sea
Through that night, riding your trigger with me.

Your local station gives out the news
""The sky is burning, in Malibu""

As the beach turns an ominous green
Bathed in light from the shape in the sky
We all tanned, in a new kind of sun
Something's wrong and we're getting ready to run

Your local station knows what to say
It's just a fuel burn so its o.k.

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart 

 Something's gone, I can't explain 
The heat is missing from the plain 
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
when you do what you do without love, without love 

 I'm gonna paint a picture of you 
The only colour I need is blue 
You're out of love, baby you know it's true 
Tell me why and I'll try to understand 

 Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
When you do what you do without love 

 It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up 
When you do what you do without love, without love 
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love",Do What You Do,1991
Graham Brown,"Baby, your heart is in serious danger,

F-n-f, up (dumb it down)

I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'mma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'mma veer so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness, the windshield is menstrual/minstrel
The whole grill is roadkill, so trill and so sincere
Yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills, when a bloke in a trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost, so a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in a lear
She's fine and she's flying, I feel I'm flying by em
'Cause my mind's on cloud nine and in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the underground king
Who's also klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I sphinx like leon
Or lying/lion in the desert
I'm flying on pegasus, you're flying on the pheasant

Spit, hot fiya like dylan on chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn

The voices rang so true
The knowledge that was lacking
Cut innocence in two

Reveals a colder time
A harder kind of living
In disillusion

Now I am grown
I'm just too uptight

Careless, heartless, soulless,
No dignity

Was I so uptight

But it costs a lot you'll learn
Take five it heals in time

And I'm still not sure, I want to change mine

Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one

In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth

In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,

I pray all ten fade away

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

In hopes of comin' true

A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy 
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him.

Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldiers life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belguim and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them

Tonight the war is over

Graham Gouldman,"He was born in a very bad part of town
Where the sun never shone
And the people went round with their heads hung low
There was no work to do nowhere to go
And so he was born to lose

Well he got up one morning and he switched on his TV
There was a whole lot of people
One big happy family
And he knew that's the place he had to be
So he got himself up
He brushed himself down
He read some books and he oiled his brain
He started to work and he started to train
And he knew he'd never be the same again
No more were you born to lose

Hey boy what you gonna do
When there ain't no future here for you
You gotta pick yourself up and pull yourself out
'Cause you know you were born to lose

Now he takes his place as one of the family
All together different colours and lookin' so fine
In the same place and at the same time
'Cause he pulled himself up
And got himself out
He read some books and he oiled his brain
He started to work and he started to train
And he knew he'd never be the same again
No more you were born to lose

Hey boy what you gonna do
When there ain't no future here for you
You gotta pick yourself up and pull yourself out
'Cause you know you were born to lose

Hey boy etc.

Work and work and work and work
Work and work and work and work
You gotta work, You gotta work (repeat)

Friends'l try to put you down
Go for it - go for it
When you want to go to town
Go for it - go for it
But if you want to sing this song
Go for it - go for it
You gotta work out all night long

You gotta go for it against the opposition
Go for it if you want to win the race
Go for it it's really your decision
Go for it you've gotta set the pace

Now you can choose the lazy way
Go for it - go for it
You can boogie all night and sleep all day
Go for it - go for it
But the best in life don't come free
Go for it - go for it
So let work be your philosophy

You gotta go for it against the opposition
Go for it if you want to win the race
Go for it it's really your decision
Go for it you've gotta set the pace

For inspiration we all need a mama and a papa
'Cause to find a reason not to work is easier than harder

Go for it against the opposition
Go for it if you want to win the race
Go for it it's really your decision
Go for it you've gotta set the pace and work

Blue guitar,
Fortune of my ways
Making of my days.

Counting up the ways
Happiness is lazy.

If you can't put the words to the tune,

Travellers in a storm,
Finding love is warm.

And the secrets we're defending
Have become our only bond

We've gone as far as we can go

The women in the meadows making hay 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play 
For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow 
And the women in the uplands digging praties 

Speak a language that the strangers do not know 
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way 
They scorned us just for being what we are 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams

Graham Lyle,"Inside, outside, up and around
Love set me up and love let me down again
Feel like a weatherman
One day sun, next day rain

For the rest of my life
I wanna live with you
For the rest of my life

When I gave my loving to you
It meant little to me

When life doesn't seem real
And you're folating about on your own
Your life seems uncertain
So you draw the curtain
Pretending there's nobody home

Don't theorize
Look in your eyes
They can't tell lies
Though you may disguise what you see
The mirror is free

We once had a savior
But by our behavior
The one that was worth it is gone

And runners are walking

He'll give you a key

So built a computer
And programmed ourselves not to see

Are they telling lies
The ones that they learn on T.V.

You must face yourself and say
I remember better days
Don't you cry `cause she is gone
She is only moving on
Chasing mirrors through a haze
Now that you know it's nowhere
What's to stop you coming home
All you got to do is go there
Then you'll really realize what's going down
You went to a strange land searching for a truth
You felt was wrong
That's when the heartaches started
Though you're where you want to be
You're not where you belong

And in my bed late at night, I miss you

By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me

Military Madness was killing my country
Solitary Sadness comes over me
After the school was over and I moved
To the other side

I found a different country but I never
Lost my pride
Military Madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild

So much sadness, between you and me

So I sing a simple song
Never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad
At the same time

I am a simple man
And I play a simple tune
Wish that I could see you once again
Across the room
Like the first time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
Hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone

The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
Make me proud to be your man
Only you can make me strong
Like the last time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
I hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
I can't make it alone",Simple Man,1971
Graham Nash,"By Graham Nash

When you were asleep
I was kissing your forehead
You gave a frown
So I kissed you again
You started waking
And put your arms round my waist
Just making sure I was there
Then you drifted away
Then you drifted away
And when I awoke
I found out I'd been dreaming
Some of my bed clothes were still on the floor
I looked around
Realized you were leaving me
I saw the back of your dress
As you slipped through the door
As you slipped through the door
And when I return
I will kiss your eyes open
Take off my clothes
And I'll lie by your side
Then I will wait
Till The sandman is done with you
And as you sleepily rise
You'll find I'll be there
You'll find I'll be there
There, there

When we give a jewel to a starving fool
And if we can't be cruel
Then let us take the tool
And change the rule, change the rule

Don't you see there's only one
Then we'll all begin to see the skin we're in
It's just the same

And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live
And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live
Stand your ground I think you've got
The guts it takes to win
But you must learn to turn the keys

So near or you'll wear the coat of questions `til the

You're supposed to be my friend

And if you carry on the way you did today
All the music in my veins will turn to stone
All the faking of your friendship
Doesn't make it anyway
Does it get you off to act so all alone
It'll chill you to the bone

So my advice to you is not to take advice

Or thinkin' that I loved you
More than you loved me

The game of gettin' more
The ego game of power

when I need the sun's heat
I need the heat, oh both way

Why is it always bittersweet

Graham Nash,"When I was a young man I found an old dream
Was as battered and worn a one as you have ever seen
But I made it some new wings and I painted a nose
And I wished so hard up in the air I rose, singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me

And I once loved a girl
She was younger than me
Her parents kept her locked up in their life
And she was crying at night
She was wishing she could be free

Course mostly I remember her laughing
Standing there watching us play
For a while there, the music would take her away
And she'd be singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world

And then there was my mother
She was lying in white sheets there and she was waiting to die
She said if you'd just reach underneath this bed
And untie these weights
I could surely fly

She's still smiling but she's tired
She'd like to hear that last bell ring
You know if she still could she would
Stand up, and she could sing, singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me",Carry Me,1975
Graham Nash,"Saw a sing on the highway
I was driving along, way home
On a hilltop is where I belong
I took a look at the hole
Where my head used to be
And I'll sing you a song
That descended on me

[Chorus]
The way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
Yes the way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
So I went to the country
To look up a friend
Cause I heard that the house
And the barn had a blend
I took a look at the hole
Where the bird used to be
And I'll sing him a song
Because he sang one for me

[Chorus]

And the names of the cowboys
Will all blow away
Like the dust off the desert
On a hot windy day

In so many ways
That I'm scared of the heartache and scenes
With the cowboy of dreams",Cowboy of Dreams,1975
Graham Nash,"My love is gentle thing
She moves with a whispering
She waits for my mind to slow
And then I'm hers to know

The water will make us one
The sleep of peace will come
The end of trouble has begun

Have you seen her love eyes?
Watching me, her love eyes ooh",Gentle Thing,1975
Graham Nash,"First rain of winter
First fall from grace
It's my first hallow echo
In the halls of praise

How could Samson
I thought he was blind as a bat
How could he have torn down
The temples like that

And how could little Caesar
How could he know whereof he spoke
When all of his wheels are turning him into a joke

[Chorus]
'Cause the blind are leading the blind
And am I amazed at how they stumble
Homeward through the haze
Got the soul of a rag picker
Got the mind of a slug

Under my rug
All of my fine
My fine fair weather friends, yeah

Will have no more time
To make their amends

I'm telling you all I've got to be on my way.

I used to keep on trying from day to day
To keep from dying and fading away.
It seems like a strange thing for me to say
I'm so tired of looking the other way
Love work out

You gotta make a love work out
There's no use hiding behind the clouds
You gotta make a love work out
I dare to scream it right out loud.

I'm telling you all you've got to be on your way

Graham Nash,"There's one more thing I would like to say
About what you do
There's one more thing
There might be one more way to do what you do.
You don't have anything

Can there be anything
Left for you to prove?
You have already made your move
Don't you even know who you are
Star?

And I woke up this morning
To the sound of a woman-a woman crying
Crying for a roomful, a roomful of dreams,
Dreams dying.

You don't have to tell the truth
Just as long as you can stand there and ignore the pain
You've got a ticket to ride on this train
By the way, you're gonna ride it alone
Alone.

It's a low down payment on this pillar
Pillar of salt
It's only had one owner, and he up and died
He died of guilt.

And you can drive it out of here
All you do is find a gear
That will blow it apart,
That's if you can even get it to start.
If the damn thing just had a heart
If it had a heart-some kinda heart.",Low Down Payment,1975
Graham Nash,"The horns in the fog could be heard if not seen,
Helping to guide the blind in a dream.
And down by the seashore, a banquet she gave
She was feeding and needing a soul she could save.

[Chorus]
Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink
Beneath the sunshine and the icicles
In the things that you think.

There's a hole in my destiny
And I'm out on the brink
Mama lion, mama lion
She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks
She's taking her time from her grandfather clocks.
And over the border, and down on the land
She's living in the future
And it lies in her hand

[Chorus]",Mama Lion,1975
Graham Nash,"The clown sat speechless, looking in his mirror
Unable to remember how to paint his face
Staring at the image, slowly getting clearer
Wondering if his fear or his heart would win the race

When it dawns on you
What it takes from you
Living under clouds of pain
There's a storm in you

You don't know what to do
Just when you think you're going insane
You lie naked in the rain again
Fluttering pages of faces

No two alike
Choice is your soul's moment
For its light to strike",Naked in the Rain,1975
Graham Nash,"Take the money and run
Like a thief across a neighbor's yard
Take the money and run
Like a ghost out in the night.
Take the money and run

To take the money and run
Because you were out of sight.
You cannot tell me any more lies
You cannot pull the wool over my eyes
Take the money and run

Take the money and run
'cause the summer sun is sinking down
Take the money and run
Cause the four winds may not blow
Take the money and run
Cause the verdict has been handed down
Take the money and run
Because there's no place left to go.
You cannot give me any more time.
You've already taken too much of mine

Graham Nash,"There's a story I'd like you to listen to.
About a lady and a Broken Bird
Broken by the hammer
You took it so hard
You hardly said a word
Sending them back over the lines
Whistling down the wire
From pole to pole
Bending them over the times
Trying to burn the diamonds from the holy coal
Telling this story slowly together
Reading in the dark
The bird that you saw dying
We saw flying.",Broken Bird,1976
Graham Nash,"I feel like a child
Feel as if I might have grown up wild
And I feel like a fool

Should but they don't
Could but they won't
And I don't see
No I don't see
Just don't understand
I must be such a foolish man
And I would laugh. If I could laugh
But it's so damn close to the bone
Would make you feel alone
And time just flies
Yes it does
Seems like fortunes moment
Passes
Blind to delight
And free from the weight of masses
But I keep expecting, things that don't happen
Should but they don't
Could but they won't
And I don't see

You finally found a girl that makes you shine
And all you ever wanted was for her to be
By your side

I hope you take the time to understand me now
If I said some things you might not like to hear
But it's only me and how I feel about you
You are my friend

Watching over all the years I've known you now
You've been looking through the glass at shooting stars
And all you ever wanted was for them to see
Who they are, it's not far

With my face in your pool
Trying my best to keep it cool

On Sailboat Bay
Mutiny
So far away

And the cannibals are waiting on the edge
To eat the meat that they can smell
And the monkeys standing in line
Can do the two step very well
On the gang plank one at a time
A story for the waves to tell-about

[Chorus]

With the ice man cooling the wind
The coastline can't be very far
With the shore man rowing behind
We'll find our way beneath the stars
But the captain sat there and grinned
And he set the sail for Shangrila

With my guitar in hand
I'm at the microphone stand
I think the reason should be very clear

Something happens to you
And the same thing happens to me
So if I sing about the places you've been to
You can see them once again through me
But it's only me

So if you catch me handing you a line
Please forgive me ah but let me be

Can you see by your lonely light of day
Is this road really the only way
Can this road be taken, taken at all

At the smile in your eyes

I see a smile on your face.",Time After Time,1976

This can't be the place

Expressions on the face of the Savior
Made me say
I can't stay.

Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here!

For anyone to heed the call.
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all.

And now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died it was a birthday
And I noticed it was mine.

And I went spinning back in time.
And I am high upon the altar

Could be, so goodbye sad eyes

Rendez vous with a Paraguayan agent.
He had the film, I had the vault-key.
I checked the stills, that's when he caught me.

A sudden blow from behind.
A perfumed note saying,
Better luck next time.

We met again at a Turkish bath in Turkey.
On the trail of a smacked-out Iraqi.
He had the name of a dame from the K.G.B.
Who knew that you were doing some work for me.
You scrubbed his back, I bugged the tub.
He spilled the beans and you pulled the plug.

Please don't be sad. If it was a straight life you had,
None of us would've known you all the years.

You take everybody's loneliness with you.
What do you lose each time you face down a room?

Of strangers and lovers that took you.

But I know you don't mind
If I laugh at the cripples
And I cry for the clowns
And I welcome the madness

And I have no opinions
So I feel no remorse

And there's fire in his nostrils
And blood in his eyes
And he's looking at you, kid
As he races on by
So watch out for his hooves
They're going to kill you for sure

That no man can cure
And his breath it will burn you

Right out of the door
And the men who control you
Keep yelling for more, more, more, more
You pay all your taxes

Way before they've been born

Some call me a thief
But the way that I look at things
I can't get no relief

Spoke out of fear

Now why are you here?
I said everything's shaking
Including myself
I keep all my feelings
High up on a shelf
And I can't seem to reach them

And I'm gasping for air

Some people just fall
Some people rise above it
Or so I've been told
So I started to leave
I was searching for more
They caught a hold of my sleeve
But I slipped through the door
I ran back to the office
With my back to the wall
When I came to my senses
I had no one to call
So I called up the doctor
He told me to lie
He said Get out of this nightmare
Or you surely will die
So I forced myself to wake up
And opened my eyes
But the man in the mirror
Was there in disguise
He was playing his part
Living in a trance
Sentenced to be a witness
'Cause he had no defense

And you're starting to sweat
And you finally realize
That it ain't over yet

But it's what you deserve
The operation is over
Listen to me please
I'm begging forgiveness
Down on my knees
Coming back to consciousness
I was out of my head
And the dream is over
I'm back in my bed

And I'll always be there

That we'd go on and on and on and all along
We'd thought we'd do another show and write another song
But I guess we've lost another one, let it slip away

Breaking all the silver threads that hold you to your dreams
One day they'll fall and you'll fly away

After all the trouble and heartache, we all go out alone
No body else can live your life for you, you're in it on your own
And you just lost another one, we let it slip away, yes, we did

Breaking all the silver threads that hold you to your dreams
One day they'll fall and you'll fly away

I watched them all sailing to the distance like a setting sun
They'd only just begun and we just lost another one

For you
I can feel it in my heart

That there's nothin' in the world
I won't do for you

When you live for love and lose
And your heart is gone
That's no time for you to choose
Not to carry on, no

And your soul is black and blue
But there's nothin' in the world

But right now she don't know you
And I can see your heart's on fire

How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun,
Who's never missed her mark on anyone,
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne.

Casino doors swing open, rich men raise their eyes they say 'Who is this beauty'
As elegant as ice, and later there's an accident, another charges d'affaires
Is lying in a pool of blood no witness anywhere.

And they say she was a hundred miles away.
The hotel porter saw her climb the stairs.
And the maid with trembling hands knows what to say.
When the judge says, 'Are you sure?' 'I'm sure,' she swears.

Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.
How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun,
Who's never missed her mark on anyone,

At the presidential palace a thousand people saw
His excellency leave his car and never make the door.
The blood flow through his fingers as he clutches at the stain
And staggers like a drunken man lies twisted in the rain.

And they say she grew up well provided for.
Her mother used to keep her boys for sure.
And her father's close attentions led to talk.
She learned to stab her food with a silver fork.

Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.

And they say she didn't do it for the money.
And they say she didn't do it for a man.
They say she did it for the pleasure.
The pleasure of the moment.

How do you stop this woman?
When everyone is moving through a trance.
Like prisoners of some slow courtly dance.

And when I sing my song
Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry
Cuts you deep and tears you apart
And will you let love try?
No, you say you're not that strong
And you don't need another broken heart
No, you don't need another broken heart

Broken heart
Do you want another love affair to start?
You don't need
You don't need another
Another broken heart

Time after time
Take a moment and decide just where you want to be
Draw the line
Seize the day and find the future that you want to see
It must be hard
To leave a life you've loved and wanted with your heart and soul
So find a love
To help you deal with all the torment taking such a toll

And when I sing my song
Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry
Cuts you deep and tears you apart
And will you let love try?
No, you say you're not that strong
And you don't need another broken heart
You don't need another broken heart
No, you don't need another broken heart

Graham Nash,"Look inside, and you will find you
Take your time, cause time will take you
From your sky, the sun is falling
But Mother Earth will soon be calling you
Back home

Dust to dust, ashes to ashes
At the speed of light, time slowly passes
And at the end, I guess nothing matters
You lived your life before the wind
Scattered you back home

As the curtain is falling
And you sing your last song
May the circle be unbroken
As the band plays on and on

Take a load off
Lay your burden down

As the curtain is falling
And you sing your last song
May the circle be unbroken
As the band plays on

Take a load off
Take a load off
Lay your burden down

And no one knows what will be waiting
So take a breath and take another
And your soul will fly across the border
Taking you back home",Back Home,2016

I can see the sad traces
Of yesterday's empires

The cracks in the city
Will trap us and trip us
Making us fall to the ground that we love
And through the cracks in the city
I can hear voices calling
Taking us all from below to above
To above

So I will follow this path
That my life lays before me
That yesterday's hero
Never dared to dream
About the stories and tales
All the long hidden memories
That sound like the echoes
Of a tale told between

Between the cracks in the city
Will trap us and trip us
Making us fall to the ground that we love
And through the cracks in the city
I can hear voices calling
Taking us all from below to above
To above

The search for oblivion
Starts out in the daylight
Listening to people
All trying to be first
But dreaming in darkness
Will offer no solace
When all the king's horses
Are dying of thirst

That will trap us and trip us

To lose myself at last

And the day that breaks before me
May never be surpassed
And the question haunting me
Is my future just my past?

Keep us alive

Intro: em / d/ a/ d (3 times)

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't give to her
G d a g
She wants so many things you don't have much
She wants so many things you can't deliver to her
She wants so many things all at once

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like a brick wall that'll keep her from crumbling
And a camouflage jacket to hide from herself in
And a system of worship like a powerful magnet
That'll draw in the heathens pick them up in a dragnet
And pull them underwater till they all go stagnant

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things beamed in on a satellite
Served up on a silver tray a wasp and parasite

G d a d
She wants so many things where you gonna find them all
G d a g
She wants so many things get up and run
She wants so many things you're at her beck and call
You're the puppet she pulls the strings just for fun

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like a blue ocean that's devoid of fishes
Cause they're all on her table prepared into dishes
Like an army of lieutenants all standing to attention
And a book about you where you don't get a mention
With her hand on a Bible she's right in your face
She's a living example of god's bad taste
And with him for an ally she can't be a heretic
But her heart's from a laboratory spun from a synthetic

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things brought without question
The gardens of babylon hanging and festooned
A ship in the desert your soul on a plate
She can't wait any longer don't make her wait

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't negotiate
G d a g
She wants so many things you feel the crunch
She wants so many things don't make her reiterate
She wants so many things all at once


Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
A collection of clowns who were dragged up in public school
Who dream up the rhythms that she dances in the disco to
They all surround her and yes her to death
With their hands on their mouths to hide their bad breath
And she lives in a fortress at the back of a project
And she'll let you in soon but not now and not yet
And she likes to see you immersed in greed
Confusing what you want with what you need

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things split up into atoms
She owns the crown jewels but you can't get at 'em

Chorus 2 repeat then instrumental verse with doo dooo doos

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't keep up with her
G d a g
She wants so many things at the same time
She wants so many things you can't keep it up her
She wants so many things you'll never find

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like three million shoes and a closet full of whips
And two dozen hats and then everyone fits
And the kind of acceptance that needs a lobotomy
That'll help you accept every single contradictory
Statement that hits you like a force nine gale
And makes you go pale every time that you fail
To bring home the bacon and bring in the goods
Get the musk from the deer and the shell from the turtle
And the gold from the fools and the shells from the sea
She says load them in a caravan bring them to me

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things brought to her feet
Cover every inch of the world in concrete
You better do it it's only your fate
She can't wait any longer don't make her wait

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't give to her

She wants so many things you can't deliver to her

",She Wants So Many Things,1991

Dropping behind her the child's things that she'll no longer need
Scattering like seeds they are discarded then
Nothing can give them a life again
They're comfort only when she bleeds

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating at her door
Even with it locked, they come back stronger than before

And when she takes a walk into the early morning
Somewhere inside you, an early warning bell begins to ring
And in the darkest night she takes a telescope
Looks through the wrong end and loses hope
Pointing at the nearest thing

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating down our door
Shaping our lives, we never know what for

And when she takes her place in the furniture
The crystal vase and the rocking chair
The chintz and China cups
Then it's all reduced to a bill of sale
She disappears with the merchandise
You understand that well

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating at her door
Even with it locked, they come back stronger than before

For your colourful evocation

Was that same vibration
The one that shimmers 
Around success

Painted by Picasso's assistants
Perfect people travel in Volvos
Into the sunsets into the distance
You're just a passenger she's not a ticket
A foreign stamp you've got to lick it 
Put it in the mail box
Put it in the fail box

In a hotel room without running water
And all the clocks are running one hour late
And on the wall are paintings of couples intertwined
Locked in embraces as if fighting for their lives
And the warm night air breathes through the open window
And husbands cling to their wives

On the corner of the street

Who talk into their mobile phones

But you don't know where it's gone
And you cannot find a name on

Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a fine word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger

Grahamophones,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1996

Grainger,"I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm sleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing (Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm sleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Grains of Time,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,
Gram Parsons,"Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes

My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew

Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone
Ooh, but I remember everything she said

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes",Brass Buttons,1974
Gram Parsons,"I can't dance
I never could
I guess my feet don't match
I'd get out there on the floor but
I'm afraid of hurtin' my back
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby
I'll come out and dance with you

But I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Some of us can, some of us can't
Some of us wih that they could dance
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby
I'll come out and dance with you

I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Some of us can, some of us can't
Some of us wish that they could dance
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby

Gram Parsons,"In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long as it would till the end

In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed

Another young man safely, strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy, his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed

The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father, and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed",In My Hour of Darkness,1974
Gram Parsons,"Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh but I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you",Return of the Grievous Angel,1974
