Renee Spearman,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the ever lasting arms

If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky 
I think about it every night and day
spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes the silence could seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first it's got to start inside of me

If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Cuz I believe in me, yea,yea,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

If I can see it

Then I can do it

If I just believe it

There's nothing to it, oh

[Chorus]

I believe I can fly(I can fly)
I believe I can fly(I can fly)
I believe I can fly(I can fly)
I can do anything yea, yea, yea. yea 
I can fly
I can do anything,  yea, yea, yea

Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)
Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)
Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)
I can do anything
I can fly",I Believe I Can Fly,2001
Renee Spearman,"I've come through many hard trials
Through temptations on every hand
Though Satan's tried to stop me
And to place my feet on sinking sand
Through the pain and all of my sorrows
Through the tears and all my fears
The Lord was there to keep me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

Not because I've been so faithful
Not because I've always obeyed
No it's not because I trusted Him
To be with me all of the way 
But it's because He loves me so dearly
He was there to answer my calls
He was there always to protect me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

I've come through many hard trials
Through temptations on every hand
Though Satan's tried to stop me
And to place my feet on sinking sand
But Jesus loves me dearly
He was there to answer my calls
He was there always to protect me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

No He's never left me
And He's never let me fall
Oh yes He will protect you 
For He's kept me in the midst of it all
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

Yes He's kept me
Yes Jesus kept me

Renee Spearman,"Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you
 
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my world seems cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
 
My hopes and dreams 
Are fading fast
I'm all burned out
And I don't think my strengths gonna last
So I'm crying out
Crying out to you

Who is able to pull me through

And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my world seems cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
 
So show me how
To do things your way
Don't let me make the same mistakes 
Over and over again
Your will be done 
And I'll be the one
To make sure the it's carried out
And in me, I don't want any doubt
That's why
 
I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life is a little bit cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
 
All I need to do 
Is hear a single word from you
I open up my heart
Just one word could make
A difference in what I do Lord
I open my heart to you

You're the lover of my soul
Captain of my sea
I need a word from you
That's why I open up my heart",Open My Heart,2001
Renee Spearman,"There is a name that is so precious,
a name so wonderful to me.
This name is worthy of all praises.
Because of him, I am made free.
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.
The one who gave, his life for me.
Because of love, so unconditional,
I will have life, eternally.

This name speaks peace, unto my storm clouds,
This name speaks calm, unto me fears.
And when I feel, that no one loves me.
His loving presence is so near.
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.
The one who gave, his life for me.
Because of love, so unconditional,
I will have life, eternally.

Praise that name!
Praise that name!
Praise that name!
Praise that name!

Someday I'll leave, this earthly dwelling,
To find a place, my soul will soar.
And finally see, the face of Jesus.
And praise his name, forevermore!
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him!
The one who gave, his life for me!
Because of love, so unconditional,
I will have life, eternally.
Excellent is that name!
Glorious is that name!
Wonderful is that name!
Oh praise that name!",That Name,2001
Renee Spearman,"Tears streaming down, her heart is broken
Because her life is hurting, so am I
He wears a frown, his dreams are choking
And because he stands alone, his dreams will die
So, humbly I come to you and say
As I sound aloud the warfare of today
Hear me, I pray

CHORUS
What about the children
To ignore is so easy
So many innocent children would choose the wrong way
So what about the children
Remember when we were children
And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show
us
Where would we be today

Sir, where is your son
Where lies his refuge
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run
Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter
And if you will just reminisce your days of young
You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes
See His love overcomes

CHORUS (2 times)

Where would we be today
Where would we be today
Where would we be today

Renee Stakey,"You say that you really love me
I'm always on your mind
And you say I should be your lover
And we should spend some time
But I'm not persuaded that quickly

Renee Tannenbaum,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above
Every day words 
Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be

Got no mansion, got no yacht,
Still I'm happy with what I've got;
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.

Got no silver, got no gold,
What I've got can't be bought or sold;
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.
(I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.)

Sunshine gives me a lovely day.
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.

Got no checkbooks, got no banks,
Still I'd like to express my thanks;
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.

Working my butt off fourteen

Once it said in the paper:
'gangland's Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito with cute blonde chorine'
That was me.
I clipped it and I saved it.
why'know, all my life i wanted to was have my own act
But no. No, no, no
Always no
One big world full of 'no'
Then? Amos came along
Safe, sweet Amos
Who never says 'no'
Lookit.
I've never done this before
But this is such a special night
And you are such a great audience!
And..And i just.. really feel like i can talk to you, why'know?
So, Forget what you've read in the papers!
And forget what you've heard on the radio!
because, because... I'm gonna tell you the truth
-not that the truth really matters-
But, I'm gonna tell ya anyways..
In the bed department?
Amos was... ZERO
i mean, when he made love to me, it was, like, he was fixing a carbouretter or sommink
'i love ya honey, i love ya'
Anywaays... I started fooling around
Then i started screwing around
-which is fooling around without dinner-
Then, I met Fred Casely
Wo said he could get me into Vaudeville
but, That didn't really work out as i planned
and I guess it didn't work out too great for fred either
So, I gave up on the Vaudeville idea
Because you figure after all those years
Opportunity's just passed you by

De la historia del reggaeton! 
Los benjamins! 
Nosotros somos el dream team

Socio, ando con la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de playe'? 
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como jack the ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas

Un gigante aquí, tanto así

El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""agua! ""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir

Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo

Renn,"There's more than one way
To take a man's breath away
A beautiful song
Or the right kind of pain
It's a dying art
Finding a brand new start
To still chase the sun
Building shelter from the rain
Hey, don't listen to what the experts say
you know the path of least resistance turns out crooked anyway
The wind still blows
The bare winter tree still blows
But the silence adds a stillness to the height
The world still turns
Dancing for an eye that burns
But you stand there, bones chilling in its light
Hey, you will never see a dead man cry
but you could swim inside the sorrows of a little girl's eyes
Your heart can stop
Moments where a pin can drop
And you pause, staring off into the sky
Hey, don't listen to what the experts say
you know the path of least resistance turns out crooked anyway
Hey, you will never see a dead man cry
but you could swim inside the sorrows of a little girl's eyes
Hey, you know the road ahead gets dark and deep

Renn,"I'm a lover starting wars
A priest lying with whores
My finger's on a trigger aimed at those I'm dying for
I went chasing for the sun
Lived my whole life on the run
Dodging shadows of the truth
And the lead from my own gun
We're all drowning, we're all drowning
We're all drowning but we're right beneath the bridges
Headed nowhere, headed nowhere,
Headed nowhere but we end up in the ditches
Drowning under bridges
I wear a crown to hide my shame
See I might judge but I'm to blame
Like a horse still marching on whose knight is dead behind the reins
Learned to walk and then to crawl
Cause I can't stand to fall
Now I'm a ghost who found a man, and I'm afraid at what I saw
We're all drowning, we're all drowning
We're all drowning but we're right beneath the bridges
Headed nowhere, headed nowhere,
Headed nowhere but we end up in the ditches
Drowning under bridges
Reach inside... Where the answer lies
Find the strength inside your bones
We still can find the water line
Free our heads and climb these stones

I'm a martyr scared to death
Because a lie is all I've bled
They built a statue in my honor, now it falls down on my head",Drowning,2015
Renn,"Every man needs a hammer

Or a mountain to climb

A damsel to rescue in the nick of time

I know, now, the answer was buried all along

All I have is heartache and a song
See, I once loved a woman
And she shined bright like the sun
I never knew how truly I could love someone
Then one day she figured
It was time to move along
All I have is heartache and a song

And my song, it goes on just like the ocean

It might calm some days, but it never really dies

All I tried to say remains unspoken

And the melody keeps waiting for the tides
We were stuck inside the summer
The heat it beat down strong
This sweat upon my brow I've known my whole life long
You'd think after all my toils,
I'd still hold her in my arms
But all I have is heartache and a song
And my song, it goes on just like the ocean
It might calm some days, but it never really dies
All I tried to say remains unspoken
And the melody keeps waiting for the tides

Well I climbed that weary mountain
I tried to build a home.
I tried to save her heart and hold it to my own
I thought I found the answers
but she went and proved me wrong
Now all I have is heartache and a song

And my song, it goes on just like the ocean

It might calm some days, but it never really dies

He ain't got the sense to hide

Before you walked down that road, headed where, only God knows to

I'll never forget you

The blood of martyrs the spit of thieves
She'll take you out on a crimson sea
Then she'll drag you down
That Jezebel
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhhhh
Listen, son....

There'll come a day when your body aches with lust

Your sweat'll drip down bleeding and your steel-eye turn to rust

You better hit your knees and pray boy, yeah you're only made of dust

the same as me... Don't fall into her schemes

I fell in love with Jezebel

She stole my teeth and my hair as well

She sang like heaven and smoked like hell

Then she dragged me down",Jezebel,2015
Renn,"They say that I'm the King of California

They tip their hats and wave, but hey

Don't say I didn't warn ya

With the other hand they'll clinch their fist

and when you turn your back, they'll stab and twist

It's the life that we must live when we find fortune
There's a pocket-watch in the jacket on my shoulders
I feel its weight; time goes by and I keep on getting older
I reach for gold to place my bet
Brush past a half-toked cigarette
It's a lonely life inside my head
But still I'm hanging on, and I keep

Waiting, waiting all along for you to

Cave in, admit that you were wrong for all you

Gave me-- Oh, for all my pride, you were the fall of me

You owe me an apology
I've done some things I ain't too proud to say
There's a God above who'll come to judge but what's His hurry anyway?
See we've all got scars to prove our tests
You either walk away or you get left
I remember every word you said and still I'm hanging on
I just keep
Waiting, waiting all along for you to cave in,
Admit that you were wrong for all you Gave me
Oh for all my pride, you were the fall of me
You owe me an apology


I've walked a hundred miles in a day
I climbed the mount to stake my flag, and I
watched it fly away
You see, heaven has no time for this...
Man's crooked games or politic
It's a lover's war or a taker's gift
and it all gets washed away and still I'm
Waiting, waiting all along for you to
Cave in, admit that you were wrong for all you gave me
Fuck my pride, you were the fall of me
You owe me an apology
You owe me an apology",King of California,2015
Renn,"Love is a tear that takes years to form
Then you blink and it falls through the cracks
Of the pieces of your heart as you watch it fall apart
'Cause you know you'll never get it back
Still the pages they turn, yeah and the lesson gets learned
And we pick ourselves up on the way
Turns out the darkness in your soul was just a big black hole
It was nothing, but you gave it a name.
Hey, it's still a beautiful world
Bounce to the rhythm of your sunshine curls
Keep on grinnin' it all works out in the end.
Hey, It's still a beautiful day
Grass is greener on the other side of rain
Weather man's calling for a reason to get going again
Fear is a thief that you wrestle in your sleep
Then you stretch and you blink and he's gone
Well, he's a voice inside your head and he won't quit 'til you're dead
but he's just there to steal your dreams all along
Hey, it's still a beautiful world
Bounce to the rhythm of your sunshine curls
Keep on grinnin' it all works out in the end.
Hey, It's still a beautiful day
Grass is greener on the other side of rain
Weather man's calling for a reason to get going again
Pain is a bitch man, she scratches and kicks
'Til you scream like the fourth of July

Why are we hiding anymore?
Cause I don't want to come back tomorrow
I don't want to come back today
No, I don't want to go back to our old mistakes
When there's a war right on your doorstep
It makes no sense to turn and run
But if we were honest
This came upon us long ago
It's our rooms, well it's in our shoes
Cause I don't want to come back tomorrow
I don't want to come back today
No, I don't want to go back to our old mistakes
Would you think about me
Like I'd think about you?
Would you still go it alone
Or would you find someone new

Renn,"Truth is I tried to touch your heart, but you were wounded
So you took it back
Blinded, blinded by things some man other than I did
Somewhere in the past
Well the truth of it my friend, is I was with you til the end
In the thick and through the thin, I would stick by you
There's nothing left to say, cuz words would just get in the way
Well I hope that still someday you'll be
Reminded, of every time your closest friends decided
To leave you behind
And taken right back to the place you were forsaken
Don't relive the lie
Cause the truth of it my friend is I'd be with you through the end
In the thick and through the thin I would stick by you
There's nothing left to say, cuz words would just get in the way

And pieces we thought would fall apart become the reasons
We still can win",Truth Is,2015

And I don't know where I'm going til I get there
Sail the ocean leave this shore, find my death and be reborn
Time's ticking, life is short, but hey I'll get there
Off in the wild blue; sick of
Staring at the sky, Checking stars lookin' for signs
What I must do; I know I'm
running out of time, mark my words: I'm gonna find my way to you

Feel the burning I my skin
A fire raging deep within
Quicker than your count to ten, I'm gonna get there
Send these bridges up in flames
Watch smoke and ash just float away
See I got this trail to blaze yeah I will get there
Off in the wild blue
Sick of staring at the sky
Checking stars lookin for signs
What I must do
I know I'm running out of time
But mark my words... I'm gonna find my way to you

I'm searching through the
Corners of my soul; I’m spinning wild, out of control
It's the only way I know until I find
I'm catching traces, counting paces on my climb
Close eyes and cut the rope
Nothing to lose nothing to show
But I know it's time to go, I gotta get there
Leaving friend and foe behind
Things that never once were mine
Kick the ladder that I climbed yeah, I will get there, oh I will get there",Wild Blue,2015

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

The streets is so cold, it's hard to hold a smile
I'm in the hood and I’ve been pushing blow for awhile
And things ain’t looking up, niggaz is in denial
And I ain’t seen no better days beyond all the trials
I walked the church isles and prayed for God's hand
To lead me through the jungle cuz imma lost man
Still no response, damn been through a lot fam
And all I’m searching for is peace up on the blocks and
All I see is murder Dope fiends and Johnny law
And niggaz struggling, please believe it man I've seen it all
If you a ghetto product and you've got it hard
This one’s for you cuz it ain’t easy being who you are

The streets are not protected under America’s constitution
Got cops and criminals and they both can't seem to stop the shooting
So we hit the 40 and the blunt like now we got solutions
Bullet holes I stop signs, crack sells I got mine
But can we stop crime so our mothers stop crying?
D-Eazy yeah I got us, we both them ghetto products
I love the ghetto so don't ever let the ghetto stop us
Don't let me get some paper cuz I can do some good
If I get rich then I gotta give back and I’m gunna give to the hood
To all my ghetto people, keep your chin proud and high

It's hard to stay sober when you know you're living greasy
The hood ain’t all that shit you niggaz see on the TV
Believe me homie none of y’all out there wanna be me
This life we lead ain’t easy ask Reno Beazy
I make a little money but everyday it's spent
And with the price of gas it's hard for me to pay the rent
Livin’ that check to check ain’t never been easy
Fuck a nine to five cuz I grind cuz minimum wedge will never allow me to find a
Way out of this struggle and suffering
So my mother and sisters stop worrying that I’m hitting the streets and hustling
Customers keep on coming in dozens and have to pay
But that's the ghetto and it keeps you trapped until you pass away

Renoly Santiago,"I been sleeping on the roof of my building
It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living
Well they won't last for all of us
But they'll last for a long summer night
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies

Bernadette

Baby, baby, baby
Be my special one
I seen you move in from across the street
I like the way you walk
I love the way you run

No more baby talk
Papi, this ain't mayaguez

On my motorcycle boots

Wastin your time here man, they don?t know what I do
Watcha lookin at, little ghetto weed
Sucio, I feel like killin you

Banana colored light skinned spics 
You feel your peel so fine
I'm Hernandez, the umbrella man
Your future's locked in mine
The chaplains, and the golden guineas
The red wings and the crowns
The mighty mau maus, those shines from Brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down, down
The savage skulls, the Fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

I think we got something to talk about
You're a coolie from the turf
That's cool, but you don't get no respect around here unless you belong to a bopping gang...
I mean, you either belong or you get hurt
Or you can buy some protection from me.

Cause if someones got to die
To pay for the shit they've done
I believe in an eye for an eye
Now what you believe in Salvador Agron, Mr.Agron,
Senor Agron.

You know it takes a strong man to survive
It ain't no accident that you?re still alive

We stand for the neighborhood
He still lives with his mother 
But he sneaks down 
A coolie in the shadow of the playground
You want to fight for your people
Don't you sal

Well, yeah if I got to

Umbrella man

Come here I want to show you something
This is the cave of the vampires 
Count Dracula's castle
The very sight could turn a white man grey
Made in the shade use my umbrella

So you want to be a vampire man that's cool

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

Just how it goes, goes without saying

REO Speedwagon,"A gray ghost night on an Eastern flight
Sixteen thousand miles away
I lay awake when the morning breaks
But what can I do to get you
Back in my heart again

The towns top gun, safe at number one
No man's will can change my life
Safe and certain, but now I'm hurtin'
So what can I do to get you

Back in my heart again
Blowin' through my life
Life a cold winters wind
Now in my mind, I know, I didn't win
I want you back in my heart again

Baby, baby, what can I say
I was wrong so I ran away
A million miles wont make me smile
I want you, want you, want you

REO Speedwagon,"Every now and then when the lights are low
Every now and then when the wind does blow
Every now and then, I think of you 

Every now and then when a girl walks by
And holds her head like you held yours high
Every now and then, I think of you 

And once in awhile when the sun sets right
And the full moon glides like a diamond in the night
Every now and then, I think of you 

And I remember you and I
In a soft golden light
Nothing like here and tonight
I won't hear about anyone's life but our own
And all that I have is hope
Baby you never know 

Every now and then when a friend says, hi
And asks about us I just want to die

I do my best to do things right
Never meant to ever hurt nobody

Ever since I met that girl
There's no one else in the whole wide world
Said she'd stay and be with me forever
Mysteries have long been told
About the girl with the heart of gold
And you know I think that I have found her 



Because every time she looks my way
I lose control, what can I say

And if your mama asks you where you've been
You've been in some good trouble all night

And I'll barely know half the places I've been

I pulled into an all-night cafe
What's my pleasure? Well ma'am the fact is, I don't know 

Sat down next to a Rajun Cajun
A black haired beauty from New Orleans
Did my duty can I buy you a drink dear
She said please

(So) we rolled right along,
And the night got long
So I said how would you like it to be? 

Then she sang her song
Said ""If I come along
You must find a place in your heart for me

I was lost on a road to nowhere
And asked if she was goin' my way
She was late for a date with no one
(So) please don't leave 

She'd just left a love that was dying
And had no plans of goin back
I caught her eyes as she was crying
Let's make tracks

My love is a rock

Mixed messages shoot through a wire 
Tender turmoil in your voice
Change is spreading through you like a fire
Bridges are burning, you made your choice
And as you're searching for peace in your world
You may find yourself spinning around, and around, and around
While the pain you've endured
Only serves to make you surer
Of the strength you have found, and then

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
Some things are here and then gone before you know
Some things disappear without a chance to grow
But my love will not
My love is a rock

You may not be looking for love, but love may find you
You may choose to close your eyes and run
You may leave love far behind you
In your eyes I can see the future
In your heart I can always trust
In your mind I will live on forever
In your arms I will turn to dust
These are feelings like I have never known
The song of my very soul
I can no longer silently sing it
I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing

Replicants,"And so the story goes
They wore the clothes
They said the things
To make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie
Like they hope it was
And the Goodmen of Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of shorn
And how they bought their positions
With saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep
To our latent fuss
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh
And we were gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream
And still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old
And dust would flow
through our veins and Low it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh
And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers
Now the dress is hung
The ticket pawned
The Factor Max
That proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edges of my pillow
And my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead
He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and
Caricature
Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky

In the Blessed and the Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh
And we were Gone

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy

I want you to really get into this one
I mean show that real beautiful emotional smile, out
And get that body all the way like entwined with that good
Thing, alright, strike a love that's so deep
Come on, out, oh, snap you
Clap your hands, huh. 'cause I like to move thee
Alright
This one is for the cover of Life magazine
So we gonna get all the way tough on this one, right, out
Snap you again, strike a love that's so deep
That was a good stop, that stop was the bomb
In the pocket, in the pocket, out, you, strike a love that's
So deep

I've lost track of my body count
The amount is enormous
Dropped in sector four
Non-conformist intimidates
Eliminating all heads of state
The punishment is banishment
Tarnishing and vanishing
I'm runnin' shit
Titanic panicking
Manic depressant
Addicted to adolescence
At the end of the crescent
Dragon's eyes glow fluorescent
Second-guess and rest in peace
Get laced in radioactive waste that's released
Feast fit for a king
Then bring two servants
Words swervin' and curvin'
You'll get what you deservin'
It's urgent
Mad Child slice precise like a surgeon
Emergency exit's where you're headin'
Ha, forget it

[Prevail]
As MC's slowly slip into sleep
Without bailin' with their hands up
Their homeboys act like Casey and Finnegan
Now this tends to send trends of frenzy
In to forensics
And then medics get hit
Lips spread like books of Dianetics
I'm a credit to my field of study
I, I kneel to nobody
You'll be as lucky as Lucy-Ann
If you get a word in edgewise
When it comes to being word wise 
I've got an edge
And a worldwide urge 
To rock on more wax than Verve
I'm in a class of my own 
And still throw the great curve
The great curves of a poet 
Is to run short on ideas
Works twice like two-way mirrors
My advice might slice like shears

The penalty is execution
Suffer consequences 
Intense as a prison riot
Barbed wire fences
Tenses, your Excellency senses
Assassins in the entrance
Disguised as my apprentice
Nonequivalent sibilance in every sentence
Send a message up by horse 
Back to the castle, through the forests
Over the hill with no hassle
Scrolls scripted in gold
Ancient enlightenment
Wizardry and wisdom
Expressive excitement
Handsome and lonesome
The brand new heaviest
Lunacy in unison
Magnificent specimen

[Prevail]
The pinpointed path 
Through the pit and the pendulum
Hypnotic gases still whirl
On the last curl of the wind mast
And narrows in 
With Apollo and Ottomans
To cause pestilence
And rid the prominence
Of so called dominance
He and I the most decadent
With a promise of providence
I'm adamant about your iris 
Seeing the style I use
When it's evident
I compile a charge 
Like an alkaline pile
The concubines of pantomimes
More war chants and streamlined design
In the line, ligaments
With imagined figments
The tragic and epidemic rise
Of zero point five micro-pigment
Can you dig it?

It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

To take a stand, to make a vow
I won't let go, you're not alone
Now and forever we'll sing together

I will never let it go, yeah I will never be the same

Gonna make it with another and another and again
There's no hope, no future, no more of these ties to you

My breakfast laid out on my bed
Some kind of memory without you, girl
She lives and spins inside my head

There's nothing keeping me alone
I spend a long time with my body, girl
I look for meaning on my own

I never meant to hurt you, yeah
No, I never meant to blame
Did you have a reason, darling
Or was it just the shame?

I know you been so mad at me
But I swear I'm gonna fix it, gonna make it be the same
'Cause there's one hope, one thing I know is true
I would drop all of my lovers just to kick it off with you, yeah

Look at those crazy boys over there
Tall ones short ones messing around,
Circle ring, ring, triangle, square

No ones going to mess with me
Not the people next to me
Sucking my emotion, you just don't care

Show you that I want to be

Knees bend and I am afraid
This is the way I go

Back and forth
You turn around and south becomes north
This is the way I know:

Stare into it don't look away
We wanna bend and move them everyway
And if the pills don't do it throw them away
We want to melt into it everyday

I see the stars are sitting next to me

Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke aboat the average loss commission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet, and now a riot will form
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm
I swing, on you fake, radio personalities
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements 
The earth use, and built it to a complex
Network, of communications, you're up against a hopeless, situation
I screen every vehicle, through enemy observation
Swarmin' unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the force significantly, change the error
Check my wind pattern, it's headin' west
Success is freedom, failure could mean death
Humans sweat, aim shovels
Dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent, damage caused by the double-
You, know who, cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you

Worldwide, practically marred in marble

Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin for the Feds
Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they say
Skip town for a mutten goofy dred
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me
Sign all documents, usin forgery, 'cause just a near thought of me
Like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth 
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell
Embracing her was like embracing a 3rd world

RES,"[Chorus]
One of these days the gig is up
Shouldn't we take the time now
To show our love

Yeah, I got the blues again
My mistake
Tell me did you see the end coming
Now I'm searching for a sign
But looking back there're only good times
Now I'm on the road again
My soul aches
It's clear that match won't work for me
And now though things don't seem so hot
I know I gave him all the love I got

Bye-bye roses
I got me a hand that's bitter sweet
But I don't care
I've known the garden

Bye-bye roses
I got me a hand that's bitter sweet
But no regrets
I've known the garden

[Chorus]

She was always my best friend
Never late and coffee ice cream made her smile
Now she's left and gone away
And I'm here by myself another day
And though I'll miss her to no end
My heart breaks
Tell me did she see the end coming
At least I know it was sunny
All the time that she spent with me

Bye-bye roses
I got me a hand that's bitter sweet
But I don't care
I've known the Garden

Bye-bye roses
I got me a hand that's bitter sweet
But no regrets

RES,"Although you're an Ice King
Everything that you gave to me
Comes from the destitute and the torn
I can't live this life no more
Just another wasted on
Like a fallen star in Babylon
You said I was your princess baby
I told you certain things you can't possess
So let me go let me go
'Cause I

[Chorus]
I've given until I break
The ground beneath us quakes
How can we grow when we've only begun
Forsaken beneath the sun
Although I've seen your wickedness
I still love your effervescence
And I know that loving you don't make no sense
But I guess that's why I like it
Just another priceless pawn
All our dreams are now forgone
You said I was your princess baby
I told you certain things you can't possess

Seems you get your kicks from at some other store
Still come around when lucks down
And you're all alone I'm sure
Well I ain't gone be there
I ain't gone be your love no more

[Chorus: x2]
If there ain't nothing that we can do
It's cool
I'd rather be alone and onto something new

Tell you what let's push all excuses aside
Don't worry about my feelings
What you got something to hide
I gave you all that I am
You kissed me so soft then lied
I know you're off sides baby
I see those tables don't tilt right

[Chorus: x2]

And then you wonder why
I need sometime to myself
You're the reason why
I want to be by myeself
And then you wonder why
I want to be alone
You're the reason why

No doubts left standing
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again

All patterns rearrange

Nobody feeling you, you're screaming in an empty room (Holla!)
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest
Don't get me started

Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's also simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground

Yo, I built up my defenses
When I'm left to my devices, time gets suspended
More than DMX's driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is?
Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything amount to crisis
I make the sacrifices
My history is black as ice is
I don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred
It takes my words, tries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet
With sticky herb
American History X, your teeth'll hit the curb
It's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay
I still flip the bird, like Jeezy
Strip it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music is on then I'm right at home, zoning",Back Again,2010

I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real

You know, who's gonna say that the borders are secure? 
We've got the House and the Senate debating this issue
And it's, it's really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants
""Immigrant"" has somehow become a bad word 
So the debate rages on and we continue

And just like that it's over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom
Not yet

I got one job, two job, three when I need them
I got five roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them
And we all came America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom
But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup
Man, I was brave, sailing on graves
Don't think I didn't notice those tombstones disguised as waves
I'm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives
Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies
All you got to do is see the world with new eyes

Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat
Cool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain't ours
Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower
Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill
Blood of my ancestors had that all built
It's the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill
Thin red lines on the flag you hoist when you kill
But still we just say ""look how far I come""

Send you to lands of ice dirt and sand
A map of the world in the lines of your hand
And you'll find what you planned isn't quite what you get
You will cry in the rubble with children you've met
To remind you to struggle and strive through the trouble with life
Is that life isn't done with you yet
And yet, you would make music make something new from the rhythms and the views
It afford beyond the images of the news if you can produce 
Then your dreams are lucid, when you spit

Cuando los números no importen

Y los aviones choquen contra los trenes y exploten
Y los animales se coman entre ellos
Y las religiones se arranquen los cuellos
Cuando las banderas se prendan en fuego

Esta raza siempre es brava
Aunque sople el temporal
Pa' aprender a defendernos
Nunca fuimos a la escuela
Aunque el toro tenga cuernos
Nuestro hogar tiene vuela

A latigazo limpio desde el descubrimiento
No pudieron, seguimos con el mismo acento
Nuestro aguante a sido digno
Somos los versos que no cantan en nuestro himno
Hay que soltar los barcos del muelle
Esta carreta ya se mueve sin bueye
Al colono los bajaremos del trono
Pa' que nuestra bandera cante en un solo tono

Residente,"Paso un agujero en el centro de la tierra
Profundo para llegar al otro la'o del mundo
Convertimos todos lo que se han callado
En la única leyenda que nunca se ha contado
En el pasado fuimos pájaros con cuatro alas
Dragones, serpientes, tigres de bengala
La mitología quería que fuéramos perfectos
Hasta que la realidad nos convirtió en insectos
En pequeños saltamontes que nadie recordaría
Los hijos no reconocidos de la filosofía
Pero con nuestras patas creamos nuevas melodías
Y saltamos por encima de todas la dinastías
Venimos de lo simple, de lo que no se sueña
Somos la grandeza de las cosas pequeñas
Y nos reproducimos en miles de formas
Cada vez que nos besamos nuestro cuerpo se transforma y

Lo que importa ya no importa
Lo que es grande ahora es pequeño
Aquí la realidad es más poderosa que los sueños
A la fantasia del mundo la volvimos loca
Sin tuviéramos que botar fuego por la boca
Así que baja del cielo y aterriza en en cualquier lote
Una sombrilla de papel de aceite hará que flotes
Mientras que una montaña de viento nos moja con aroma de te verde que soplan la ojas
El agua del pacífico penetra por la orilla
De un rio que corre con la piel amarilla
Los capullos de oruga se desenredan
Y tejen con su hilo universos de seda
Cuando nos tocamos el terreno se humedece
Dentro de tu vientre el arroz que se cultiva crece
Durante el día todo el bosque suena
Y los grillos cantan porque la cosecha es buena",Una Leyenda China,2017
Residente,"Todos te estaban esperando
El viento cantaba bailando
Las olas se levantaron de su silla
Y los caracoles te esperaban en la orilla
También te esperaban en la arena desde los animalitos más chiquitos hasta las ballenas
Las estrellas se veían a plena luz del día
Porque te esperaban para hacerte compañía
Y naciste, rápido y despacio
Respirando como un astronauta en el espacio
Hablabas otro idioma
Que venias de un planeta sin personas
Y despertaste hasta las plantas
Cuando la selva rugió desde tu garganta
Y aunque no entendieras todo lo que sentiste
Sin tener que abrir los ojos nos descubriste

Bolsita de leche
Masita de pan
Pipita de harina
Cachetes de flan
Deditos de algodón en las manitas y en los pies
Agua santa que huele a bebé
Te ries y el mundo se siente importante
Y todos los duendes se vuelven gigantes
Contigo los días son fiesta
Y haces que la música suene sin orquesta
Te gusta que el viento te sople en la cara
Comer con las manos sin usar cuchara
Tocar las flores que salen en abril
Y hablar con los trenes del ferrocarril
En tu propio eje y sin camiseta
Te gusta dar vueltas como los planetas
Convertirte en carro y también en cohete
Jugar todo el tiempo aunque no hayan juguetes
Andar por el pasto sin las zapatillas
Eres amigo de las cosas sencillas
Por eso me abrazas y me descongelas
Y me haces sentir como un globo que vuela
Ahora ya se porque escribo
Aunque nunca sepa el día ni la hora en la que vivo
Cuando hablas mi despiste te atiende
Viniste a enseñarme como es que se aprende

Nunca es tarde para nada
La mañana está esperando
Si te perdiste el tren puedes llegar caminando
Las oportunidades ahí están
Pero son como las olas
Llegan y se van
Y aunque seamos de colores diferentes
Todos comemos con la boca
Y masticamos con los dientes
Hay que ser buena gente y agradecido
Y proteger el árbol pa' que no se caiga el nido
Y ojalá que nada te duela
Pero si te duele que te sirva de escuela
Ojalá que te enamores muchas veces
Porque con un beso lo malo desaparece
No tienes que llorar
Va a parar de llover
Yo salí a trabajar, pero voy a volver
Y te voy a construir un castillo de bambú
Lo que nunca tuve yo quiero que lo tengas tú",Milo,2017

Residente,"Mi escuela tiene alma y tablas
Va con sudaderas viejas, con las Nikes sucias y la barba larga
No necesita efectos para adornar lo que habla
Rapea lo que vea, os tirotea en dos palabras
Yo empecé rapeando simple, con un sample y temple
El hobby de un adolescente dura para siempre
Un pro desde los 15, y no se rinde, endiente
Que pone en venta sus canciones pero no se vende
Crónico insolente que usa balas de saliva
Mi escuela nunca fue tendencia pero sigue viva
Tenemos iniciativa, perspectiva
Si algo no nos motiva
Subimos el dedo del medio arriba
Hablo de mi equipo, esos tipos que quitan el hipo
Mitos que lanzan cada escrito al infinito
Otros actuando crazy y yo cerrando el pico
Más cerca de Kase que de Jay-Z, no sé si me explico
Tengo a mi clan siguiendo un plan para ganarse el pan
Tengo a mis fans buscando paz, en mí la encontrarán
Tanto charlatán sin más afán que el famoseo
Troceo al holgazán como un croissant cuando lo veo, es fácil
Su música infantil e inútil, la mía es táctil
No habrá bandera blanca en este mástil
Sé que el rapper de actitud nazi y hostil es frágil
Mezclo mi mente con TNT, sale algo así tan ágil
Y como delfines sus fines no me definen
No tines si no lo vives, no opines, no subestimes este nombre
Nach rima sublime, es algo enorme, dime
A cuánto torpe fulminé junto a su melodine
Dejo que rimen, veo que se hinchan y se pinchan
Son muchas Dianas para mi flecha
Piensan en su hucha y no en la lucha
Van sin antorcha, sin mecha
Les echan pronto, porque pronto se han pasa'o de fecha
Soy hombre de palabra, no me hables de números
Sus canciones secas, mis fraseos húmedos
Sinceros, sin peros, sin treguas
Sin pelos la lengua que os lame
Mi mierda es tan seria como un derrame
Ven que les electrocuto y disfruto
No hay sustituto si escupo
Ocho minutos de absoluto rap bruto
No me inmuto si no sueno en radios
Yo sueno en barrios
Mis hombres le echan huevos
Mis hembras le echan ovarios
Pero hay terminas que imitan
Me irrita, buscan visitas y guita
Gritan y gritan, se excitan 
Luego sin más se marchitan, mi música es dinamita
Los decapita, les quita su ego
Luego es normal que dimitan
Llego, les hiero, soy puro veneno
Cuando me acelero me cuelo en su juego, los hundo
Soy como el hielo, congelo sus celos
Sufren el dinero, los tumbo
Los encadeno, es lanzo mi trueno
Sin freno, sueno y retumbo, así de rotundo
Quiero solo verdaderos guerreros salvando a mi mundo

Yo, yo, yo no tengo escuela
Sin que soplara, el viento aprendí a navegar barcos de vela
Mi rima encima de una cumbia como quiera impacta
No sigo ningúna escuela porque soy autodidacta
Nunca seguí las reglas con pistas de rap genéricas
Como un cajón peruano, escribí Latinoamérica
Mi rap no sigue órdenes de ningún sargento
Hijo de puta, yo creé mi propio movimiento
Que narra y sin garras te desgarra
No crecí escuchando a 2Pac, crecí con Violeta Parra
Y cuando deletreo los educo sin pizarra
Con solo dos barras las rockeo sin guitarra
No creo en dioses del rap, mucho menos en reyes
Yo soy la fucking gravedad desafiando las leyes
Yo soy el orden pero cuando se desarregla
Todas mis líneas son curvas, siempre rompo las reglas
Acostado bajo la sombra de una palma, relajado
Compitiendo contra mí mismo porque no tengo a nadie al lado
Me gusta abusar de los raperos fresa
Les dejo la ""R"" en las nalgas impresa
Antes de bajarme esa cerveza
Fácilmente los torturo
Solo les quito el Instagram y vuelven a ser inseguros
Tu moda no creo que dure
Las quinceañeras que te siguen hoy
Ya no te seguirán cuando maduren
Mucha selfie y poco contenido
Se tardan más en el vestuario que haciendo pruebas de sonido
Sus conciertos son todos iguales
Pocas rimas, poca banda, muchos fuegos artificiales
No se me escapan cuando escribo
Son fáciles de identificar porque se visten con colores llamativos
A estos raperitos nunca les he visto la cara
Siempre les veo de espalda
Cuando los pongo en 4 y les subo la falda
Y me los follo por los dos hoyos
Sin apoyo los arroyo, al estilo criollo
Los convierto en caldo de pollo
La policía me busca por acoso sexual
Y por perverso porque como Kase.O: soy un violador del verso
Y la goleo, porque con las dos piernas pateo
En el freestyleo desde el tiro libre la dunkeo
Y sin rodeo, cuando me cabreo, con mi palabreo
Pongo a hablar en árabe hasta los hebreos
A veces le meto tan rápido que el alfabeto no lo veo
A los del maleanteo los abofeteo
Como novela de abuela sin empleo
Mi lengua se tira acrobacias nunca antes vistas
Es malabarista, todo un artista
Y como Michael Jackson hace el Moonwalking por la pista
No hay quién resista al Residente
Cuando los baja caliente, los pongo de rodillas literalmente
Como a los creyentes en el medio oriente
Arrodíllate y reza, soy un talibán, rimando corto cabeza
Con mi destreza les quito el corazón con la boca y lo pongo en la mesa
Encima de pan de hamburguesa
Con mayonesa y sala japonesa
Y un poco de jugo de fresa
Me los desayuno, mi lengua nunca se tropieza
Cuando se expresa, los atraviesa con naturaleza
Mi sopa de letras empieza, abran la represa que llegó la pieza
Que falta en el rompecabezas

Just pray you don't become a victim of the game

Hard cold reassurance, blue steel in your coat

I knew it when we made love 
And I couldn't quit calling her name 
And I've been hit by another fast movin' train

Why the fear wouldn't let me tell her

I waited till she fell asleep

But in those quiet times
He whispers, ""You are mine and I love you,""

Sometimes we know we're wrong
And we feel so far from home,
But if you'll listen,
You'll hear his gentle voice saying, ""You belong.""

The cares of life they sting,
But when we see the king,
Oh, they'll melt away just like the snows in Spring,
No more tears, no more crying,

""Behold, I come quickly,
And every eye shall see,
Oh, well, every tongue will swear to me,
I am the saviour and I love you.""",The Return,1992
Ret. Staff Sgt. Shilo Harris,"[Chorus]
So what's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I don't know, I don't know
All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage
Grand arsony cause I'm still in the show
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

Let me tell you about this bitch ass half cock pussy ass niggas
It's never gonna pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
Because what you lack in a fight
That we all fight similar self aided mutilation
Never lost angel Los Angeles congratulations
From admiration to aggravation to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all
Praying for my downfall got the fuck from around y'all
Know when niggas bringing me down even include myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
Memento tried in stealth
Explain Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fail for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these fifteen minutes to hours
But still ask

[Chorus]

Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits
Caught up into politics
Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology surveillance's a bitch
And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone
The few will see freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for em attacking the land lords
'Cause the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die may it not be in vain more
Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly
Got my future in front of me focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch

[Chorus]

When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was alot of my motivation because I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights
Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on into your destiny and set the stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets
This for the set this for the ones that never waken up
Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck
They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth
It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute
That's why they shoot have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots

[Chorus]

The best help that you can do is help yourself
You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it because you know you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in the road
Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself",Meaning of Life,2012

Made a lot of money, live a life of glory
Did what he done but he end up sorry

Made a lot of records and he tricked the funds
Took it to the top and he stayed number one

Made 'Piper Peter' and he kicked much rhyme
Had a two-seater and he rode past signs
Smoked a lot of Cheeba and he drank much wine

Got a revelation and he came back clean
Got a second chance to fulfill his dream
Now Joey is a Reverend and he live redeemed

My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby, are you really real?

Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man

But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1997
Rev. Billy Graham,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,2000

Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;

Rev. Billy Graham,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure. 
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die. 
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

Rev. Billy Graham,"I dreamed I went to heaven
You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

One by one they came,
As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave",Thank You,2001

Because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because i know he holds the future
And life is worth the living

Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",
Rev. Dave Boruff,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door

"Rev. David Ausby, Sr.","Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 

See you survived the worst but my life is glorious 
Betta know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious 
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now you can call me Morpheus 
As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious 
You know that I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now 
Superceded everyone of my middle struggles and 
Failure never ever has been an option 
A paper long like we was on the trap and we bout ta take the hood shoppin' 
Get it! 

Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the project to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) *yeah 
On the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
On the road *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 

When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line 
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind 
And it finally came time to do it or let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride 
Sing it! 

Together we made it (you see we did itit did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!)

On the road (ride with me) 
On the road (you come and get it) 
On the road 

Look in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm building 
Things that I could leave for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get the hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To counting money like Dre and Jimmy or Russell Ross 
But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it 
Sing it

Rev. Douglas B. Long Long,"This shirt is old and faded
All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.

You can shave my head, clean as my hand
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

You read about Samson, all from his works,
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.
The bees made honey in the lion's head.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.

The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Reveille,"The phoenix, no longer a myth
So strike a match and watch it burn
Our destination's rigor mortise
'Cause nobody listens and nobody learns

And your world rejects my kind
And those words have lost their touch
And this place has lost its mind
So now I wanna burn it up

Humility, is based on trust
But ignorance and arrogance rule the grounds
So ashes to ashes and dust to dust
And now I wanna burn this whole place down

Leashed, cuffed, locked and hooked
Blow it down, tear it down, burn it down
Blackmail come take it to a whole new level
Motherfucker, I can't wait till I can watch you drown

And you place our trust in you
Reassure us that we're not to blame
But the tables turn and we're the first to burn
Now I could never look at you the same

So take your word and shove it
Come take your deal and shove it
Just take the lie and shove it
I know what you really are

The school in which we learn
Is the fire in which we'll burn
The school in which we learn
Is the fire in which we will burn

After the pain, careless and cold
We carry the life you'll never know

You cherished everything (that'll help us now)

Something like an emptiness inside.
And there were times it almost sent me...
Like the time I almost thought you died.

There are things I've never seen,
I hope I'll soon recover.
All the pain and joy in life,
I'd like to try another.
And when I try and you'll decide,
I'll ask the gods if I've got time.
Like the boy who's lost and found,
I love a man who stands his ground.

It was just a long forgotten feeling.
Something like and emptiness inside.
And there were times it almost sent me...
Like the time I almost thought you died.

There are things that I have seen.
I've looked above to live my dreams.
A sudden lack of energy,
When all the angels came for me.

When I try and you'll decide,
I'd look to god the reasons why.
What they do when I go [home],
Is laugh at life -- admit you're wrong.

It showed me the one thing that made me so bad

I fade in the light and then pray for the night

Reverend Bizarre,"YouÂ´re a man with thousand faces,
Every day another mask.
You creep within dark places,
Implementing a dreadful task.
You act like a man of mission,
But to whom do you believe?
DonÂ´t you talk to me about Jesus,
Cause every word is blasphemy.

Absorbed in your own mind,
This is how you wish to be.
Thinking youÂ´re a one of a kind,
An apostle of all misery.
You speak in mystic language,
Utterly with no meaning.
Those who follow you,
I guess they must be dreaming.

Let them crawl at your feet.
YouÂ´re a king, at your Throne of Greed.

Just turn your back
To the One Who Wept.
DonÂ´t even think
The promises unkept

I hope youÂ´ll burn in Hell,
Because youÂ´re an evil man.
Your heart belongs to the Devil.

Reverend Bizarre,"It came like a black cloud rolling through the sky
Without warning I had to learn the truth.
As the book was closed we all knew it was his turn to die
And I was to be cruelly evicted from my youth

That first day of summer I unveiled the secrets of Doom
And I walked with legion of Demons by my side.
My whole world fell into the void at his funeral room,
Caressed by summerÂ's gentle breeze I cried

Oh Lord, I canÂ't conceive
Why was he torn from me?

Death is all that I see when I observe the world we have built
And Death is the majesty we all have to face.
But you my God are the one and your word is fulfilled
As we sleep under peaceful shade of your grace

Until that I just weep
Waiting for eternal sleep.
How can I carry on,
Stand up and see the sun?

Reverend Bizarre,"I have heard the war is coming. I am ready and willing to fight
For one last time I need your lovin'. Won't you warm my lonely night?
Many good men before me have gone to serve their lands, sacrificing their lives
Years have passed, remembrance lives on, all the tears of

Mothers and wives

Maybe one candle there will burn, in memorium of a soldier so brave
If it's the war we are heading towards, all the more I need your love",One Last Time,2007

Reverend Run & The Christmas All-Stars,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man
Word up

When them guns goes off, bitches hit the floor
When them guns goes off, and them sirens roar

Dead at you, he throwin' the hot lead at you
Swang affiliate, X.O. sip, a gold getter
With the rest to gather, my cold killer
It's ""Me Against the World"" like 2Pac
And like Biggie, I'm ""Ready to Die"" for what you got
Got a crew with killas behind me, I'm grimey
I'm one of the big body, blowin' cushions where you can find me
For figures, we bust triggers, who could fuck with us?
Dub, E-40, Christ Bearer, plus RZA
Stick you with the Blade, we gots to get paid
And for the moolah, we intertwine like French braids
And I can't fight the feeling like one way
When it comes down to this gangsta shit and gun play
For the loot, we compute it, quick to shoot it
So hit the switch, punk blew it, and bang the music

After all, all, all, all, all....)

Or then forty four slugs gonna hit you, ho
I don't care what it takes, I pull out a gear
Fuck the snakes, and Kurtis Blow with The Breaks off
Artie Murphy and the Petty Coat Junction
Get two thirty off the head with cold dumplings
Niggaz jump when the AK bark
Crystal grip pump, make the gun niggaz spark
You dig? Niggaz ready for war
Been carryin' the world for so long, it ain't heavy no more
And even when the sirens roar, I taught the violence gore to start firing more
And when we run out of bullets, and you still want static?
I grab the three eighty and pull out the automatic
We better get the money, for shootin' Mossbergs and Beretta's
Niggaz ain't shit funny, when it comes to a brawl
Suckin' Northstar, trippin' in
Guns go off, why'all know why'all strippin'

I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

Speaking to you 

We try to say with confidence 
That were picking up oblivion 
Inside of you

All around you there's a feeling you lost 
That everything beautiful 
Is not what it was 
Whenever you were on top 

Of all you left up there 
It's getting me down 
To the place that I land
That hits me so hard
With a cruel understanding
That It might be the end

Everyone talks again

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll bury myself into the corner 
I can't even tell if I won't see anymore [2x]",Places for Breathing,2003
Revis,"How heavy the sky was outside of my windows 
And from the inside I watched it go by 
With all that I've got to reach back to remember 
The things I fought, so hard with each thought 
Then your voice returns until every word burns the walls 
I tried to keep you outside, you're part of me now 
But you're not around 

Why you're under my skin 
You found a way to get in 
Why you're under my skin 
And now the thoughts I resist 
I reuse 

Strange how it hits me when all of the moments I used to know travel so close 
Through my invitation, I'm reluctant to feel it pierce through my skin 
And with every inch it brings back the hurt 
As thoughts recur inside my head of all that we said 
To leave it behind but now you're inside 

Why you're under my skin 
You found a way to get in 
Why you're under my skin 
And now the thoughts I resist 
I reuse 

You're a part of me now but you're not around",Re Use,2003
Revis,"It's all over 
It's all over now 
The seal is broken 
Creatures spoken now 
I hope you go up to heaven right now 
It's all over 
It's all over now 

Can I be changed? 
Or am I the same 
It's all over 
It's all over now 
No room for hiding 
We're children fighting now 
And hope you go up to heaven right now 
It's all over 
It's all over now 

Can I be the same? 
The rain is falling 
The rain is falling now 
Today we're leaving 
Our souls are calling now 
The stars on his right holding seven right now 
The rain is falling 
The rain is falling now 

Can I be changed? 
Or am I the same 
It's all over 
It's all over now 
No room for hiding 
We're children fighting now 
And hope you go up to heaven right now 
It's all over 
It's all over now",Seven,2003
