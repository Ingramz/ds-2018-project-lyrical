Chris Isaak,"Tu passes tes doigts sur mes lèvres
Ma taille tient dans une de tes mains
Je ne suis pas si fluette
Mais contre toi, je ne peux rien

Emmène-moi encore, tire-moi vers toi
Vers ton corps
Tu sèmes mes terreurs
Je pense à toi ou à nous,
Je n’pense à rien, rien du tout

Si j’avais su que notre amour serait si fort,
Je n’y aurais pas cru mais c’est fou comme je t’adore

I’m coming my love, walk ahead / J’arrive amour, je te suis
Just let me stay behind you for a minute / Laisse-moi rester un peu derrière toi
Your lovely figure, your shadow, your tread / Ton pas, ton allure, ton ombre si jolie
I love crunching you without you knowing it / J’adore te croquer sans que tu me voies

Emmène-moi encore, tire-moi vers toi
Vers ton corps
I’m feeling so strong / Je me sens si bien
I’m feeling fine, yes I do / Je me sens femme dans ton cou
It gives me powers touching you / Soudain j’ai la force d’un loup

Je n’y aurais pas cru mais c’est fou comme je t’adore
Si j’avais su que notre amour serait si fort….

Chris Isaak,"Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too

For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea

Chris Isaak,"On the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot
Dan dropped in around five o'clock
Took off his coat, said ""The night is short""
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quarter

He hollered, ""Rave on, children I'm with ya,
Rave on cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn, the cops is gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Well, Dan got happy and he started raving
He jerked out a razor but he wasn't shaving
And all the cats knew to jump and hop
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn, the cops is gone
Let's all get Dixie fried, fried, fried, yeah""

The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
They all ran in to see what it was about
And I heard him holler as they led him away
He turned his head and this is what he had to say

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn, the cops is gone
Let's all get Dixie fried, fried, fried?

Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
And he let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
Through the black crossed bars he tossed a note to his dear
""It ain't my fault, sugar, I'm in here""

For hollering, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn, the cops ain't gone
And I've been Dixie fried""",Dixie Fried,2011
Chris Isaak,"You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

I learned to love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me honey
This world is fine, you're mine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Kiss me baby, feels good
Hold me baby, I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm surely nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Oh kiss me baby, feels good
Hold me baby
I wanna love you like a lover should

Chris Isaak,"I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?

Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?

Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away

Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
And I'm asking you, darling
How's the world treating you?

Chris Isaak,"I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind.
I thought I'd never miss her,
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time.

The day we said goodbye
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met.
Oh darling something sure is wrong,
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely.
I forgot to remember to forget.

Oh darling the day you said goodbye

Chris Isaak,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line",I Walk the Line,2011
Chris Isaak,"It's now or never,
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling,
Be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late,
It's now or never
My love won't wait.
When I first saw you

With your smile so tender
My heart was captured,
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime

Waiting for the right time
Now that your near
The time is here at last.
It's now or never,

Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling,
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late,

It's now or never
My love won't wait.
Just like a willow,
We would cry an ocean

If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me,
Let your arms invite me

For who knows when
We'll meet again this way
It's now or never,
Come hold me tight

Kiss me my darling,
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late,

When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness

Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you

Chris Isaak,"Her hair is gold and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be, but she's not you

She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
Everything a man could want, but she's not you

And when we're dancing, sometimes it feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whispering your name

She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart, 'cause she's not you
Yeah it's just breaking my heart, 'cause she's not you

And when we're dancing, it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whispering your name

Chris Isaak,"Well I called you for the last time, I won't hang around no more
I don't even remember the number on your door
I don't need you any longer, I don't want your devil's charm
Go and cry your heart out, In your other lover's arm

So long, I'm gone, you won't forget me
I hope you recall all of our fun
So long, be sweet and remember
When you want me back, think of what you've done
You've lost the guy who loved you, don't say I didn't try
This time I'm gone forever, I've said my last goodbye

So long, I'm gone, you won't forget me

Chris Isaak,"I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Trying to get to you.

Ever since I read your letter
When you said you loved me too
I've been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
Running all the way,
Trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
Still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was darkest night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.",Trying to Get to You,2011

Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy baby
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy
You don't want that guy

You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel babe
You wanna roll with me
You wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me

I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good baby
Tell me you depend on me
I need to hear it

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself

How does it feel to know that I love you baby?
I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Baby you're the perfect shape
Baby you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way
I want it that way
I want it

Tell me you don't want me to stop (Don't stop)
Tell me it would break your heart
That you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me
You wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me

I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good baby

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

I'm lost without you

It's in the air
The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare
Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there
With every hit I take, you move that waist and I wanna die
A girl like you, adore
The way you drop that thing could start another war
And my hands are gettin' eager to explore
Cherry lips are singin' ""Purple Rain"" and I feel alive

(I just wanna)

I take the wheel and grab the clutch
Your body should be mine to touch
I fit the rhythm your body's givin'

She got the smoothest ride
Like velvet all inside
Her sex just changed my life
She rides like a dream
And damn that velvet looks good on me

I feel the heat
Every drop of you is rainin' down on me
You're perfection's foggin' up my window seat
I got your body switchin' all positions through the night

Chris Jamison,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancing with another man

'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
And it's hard to believe that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road

And when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
You know I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her

On a park bench down on fourth street I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand
Oh then a few short years later God put into my world
A six pound eight ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day, let me tell ya now I've been a brand new man

Because when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing, yeah that I feel

Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar 

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo si me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (Let go, come on)

Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos 

Sé que te pasas negando, todo lo que tú y yo hacíamos 
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos 
Ahora me paso pensando, cómo tú puedes vivir así 
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre sábanas tú te entregaba a mí

Solo yo, he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero 
No quiero interrupciones

Llámate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil

Diciendo mil cosas 
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá 
Por mi vida famosa 
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa 
Tú sabes que yo soy real 
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer 
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver 
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby 
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti 

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal 
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar 
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar 
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar 

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo 
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo

Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir

Chris Jericho,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007

You know I won't stop blowing kisses at everyone

Love heal me 
Oh how she comes when we collide 
Not now you'll say this is the game we play 
And our love comes when we collide 
It drives us apart, this attraction 
It wont be our fault 
Stand with your feet on the stairway but you never walk 
When will you move 
Leave here for good 
Can't break the strings that you never could 
It's all that you want 
Its all that you need 
Love pull me 
Love heal me
Our love comes when we collide 
Not now you say 
This is the game we play 
Our love comes when we collide
Can you feel it 
Can you heal it

Chris Knight,"I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I walked down to the road, filled a beer can full of 22 holes
Then I said goodbye, yeah I said goodbye

I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? At my mothers' house 
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route

There ain't much of nothin' left, this place where I became myself
Ghosts and memories, I'd walk on by but they'd follow me
I'd seen plenty on down the road. Asked him if he'd seen my brother
He just said no, well I guess I'd better go

Chris Knight,"I wasn't stranded in the desert
I wasn't drifting out to sea
I was in no kind of danger
That would be the death of me
But when you took me in your arms
Like an angel from above
I was saved, saved by love

I wasn't strung out in some alley
With a habit I couldn't kick
Wasn't lost in dark depression

The van broke down in a foot of snow.

The batteries gone and the phone won't charge.

I ain't had no sleep, ain't washed my clothes
But everybody says it's a damn good show.
The pay's enough and the crowds are good,
But sometimes I'd rather be chopping wood 
Or rolling rocks up a hill,
But it's the only way I know to pay the bills.

And the songs I sing can't get through and my mind fills up with you 
And I drift off in a dream, about you and me.

When I wake up to a wild ass crowd, the guitar amp is way too loud.
Well the drummer's been cheating on his wife 
And the bass man is too drunk to drive
That's the way it goes
I'm just doing my best to get back home

And the songs I sing can't get through and my mind fills up with you 
And I drift off in a dream, about you and me

It's morning, time to wake now
Your body and mine entwined will have to break now
I want your flesh, your warmth to stay beside me

And I'll give you mine, be truthful and revealing

And it's true that I love
It's love not given lightly
But I knew this was love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

When we're alone I cannot always face you
Maybe my mood won't let these arms embrace you
That doesn't mean my love's somehow diminished
Give me the time to show our love's unfinished

And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly
But I knew this was love
And it's you that I love 
And it's more than what it might be

I need your body, your mind and your emotions
Shed me your tears till I drown in your oceans

And it's true that I love

And it's you that I love

Chris Komer,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013

But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty

When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.

to give of yourself
Ask the lonely and the dying

If your drowning in the doubt
as the candle goes out
Faces at the window
and a whispering that won't go
Focus on the dawn
and the promise of morning
Look ahead of winter
Let the breath of summer into you

They're always waiting for morning
Always waiting for light to come around
Always waiting for morning
and the light to come shining in",Only One,2008

And when my chance comes I'll give it a whirl

Spurrin' a wild with my head flung back
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack

Well here I am I'm a layin' in bed

I'm a-layin' here dyin' and a hurtin' real bad
Now I wish I'd listened to my old dad
When he said son you'd better stop foolin' around
You're gonna get your guts stomped into the ground
You'll come flyin' from the chute with your tail up high

Chris LeDoux,"I was sittin' the a bar-room one rainy afternoon
Tellin' stories about rodeo and listening to a tune
The rodeo starts tomorrow in this one horse town
So Bill took our names and put our entries down

I went to the office the next day to see
What bareback horse I had and pay me fees
I looked on the list, but my name wasn't found
I thought Bill might have forgot to put me down

I looked on the board and I happened to find
My name was on another list - I was in the bull ridin'
My knees began to knock, and my face began to sweat
And I heaved and gagged on the rodeo office steps

Well, I may be a fool, but a coward I'm not
So I borrowed a bull rope with a bell in the knot
I walked in the arena with them other bull ridin' fools
And walked down to the chutes and found my bull

Then I put my rope in the middle of his back
I had some cowboy pull out the slack
And then I wrapped the tail around my hand and back and said
""Boy's, open the gate just a little bitty crack.""

Well the bull hit the gate with his head
And I could see over his hump that his eyes were red
He bailed out of there with a big snort and beller
And something inside of me told me I was yeller

Well the dust and hairs and flies come off his hump
It whisp to my nose as he made another jump
And the stink of it all was more than I could stand
So I jerked my wrap and opened my hand

Well he jumped in the air and made one more turn
As the rope slid through my hand it sure did burn
He flang me down in a great big heap and
Right in the middle of me he did leap

With his feet on my belly standin' in place
That dirty old bull blew snot in my face
So them damned old bulls you can run 'em in a chute
And put your ropes on them big galloots
But the closest you're gonna find me to their stinkin' hair
Is to help some other fool get flung in the air

Boy the next time I see Bill I'm gonna break his dang neck
Enter me in the bull ridin'
Shoot I think I'll enter him in the Barrel Racing

His bull was standing in the chute his girl was in the stands
Wating to hear the name of her brave young man

He climed down on the back of that big ol' Bramer bull
One of the veteran cowboys came and gave his rope a pull
Someone said are you ready boy he said I guess I am
The bull jumped out and turned back and flung him to the sand

The hometown girl had watched it all and wasn't to impressed
She started looking around for a real man from the west
She looked around the arena and standin' by the fence
Was a tallean cowboy with a big black hat and tight fittin Levi pants

It was Jim a fine young cowboy he rode Broncs and Bramer bulls
He rodeo them quite consistently so his pockets were always full
Somehow he happened to glance up in the stands
And he saw that pretty blond haired girl as she was watching him

Meanwhile the hometown cowboy was back behind the chute
Dabbing blood off his nose and dumpin' sand from his boots
He got himself together wiped some manure off his shirt
He knew his girl would sloothe him cause he was darn sure hurt

He saw his blood haired girlfriend as he rounded the main grandstand
And his poor heart sank as he saw her leaving with another man
So boys if you don't rodeo leave well enough alone
And don't take your girl to the pitching cause you may not take her home

Chris LeDoux,"I suppose, there's a better way to make a livin'
To make money so I could live in luxury
But the life behind a desk in a building
Would be like a prison sentence to me
My manners are not refined or even polished
And my speech it may be crude to most you see
I guess that I was just born a dreamer
But in my life I relish pride and being free
My clothes are high heeled boots and a big hat
And the buckle on my belt I wear with pride
You might even find a snuff can in the pocket of these old wore out faded
Blue Levi's
Well I'm a cowboy
On the rodeo circuit
And when it's time to ride Well I bear down and try
But when I play I go to some ol' crowded bar room
And get drunk & wild along with the other guys
Well I know it can't go on like this forever
And I maybe a fool just runnin' wild through life
But it's my life and I'll live it to the fullest
And I can look back and say that it was right
And some day when my rovin' days are finally all over
Well I can picture a little home down beside a stream
And with a son and his mother sittin' by me and with love I'll help him to
Strive to reach his dream.

Chris LeDoux,"Them bareback horses are the only thing
They make your back hurt they make your bell ring
They're hard on tailbones and they make your neck sore
But when it's all over you're craving some more

Well you drive down the road in a broke down car
You stop in some town you wonder where in the hell you are
You get yourself a road map and head out once again
With only enough for fees so you'd damn sure better win
You finally make the pitchin' with your entry fees all paid
You get on another snatcher and he flings you away
So you head to town broken hearted lookin' for a chance
To get a little drunk and find some girl and dance
Well you meet a little girl at the bar all alone
You whoop some words on her to get her to take you home
But she's got a big boyfriend who just came from the can
And he says move on there buddy cause he's her lovin' man
So you climb back in your car after your little bitty fight
You're drunk and broken hearted
And it's twelve o'clock at night
And you ain't got a dime in your old blue jeans
But by God you got a half a tank of gas
And a can of pork and beans

You write a hot check to pay your fees once again
You got yourself a good one so you ought to win
The horse is standin' in the chute then he bucks around
The whistle blows then you're standin' on the ground
The judges total their markings and they tally up the score
And you're beatin' everybody by at least ten points or more
So you climb back in your car with a pocket full of cash
A good feelin' in your heart and a tank full of gas
But boys the day finally comes when you get old and grey
You gotta hang your spurs up and put your riggin' away
You look back now with a wantin' eye

Chris LeDoux,"Well she rolls her own cigarettes with the work of just on hand
She acts mean and she cusses I know she wish she were a man
She got her teeth knocked out by a bucking horse
And when I told her that It made her look tough
She just grinned and said I like it that way
And then she loaded up her lip with snuff
She's my snoose queen she's my Copenhagen angel
She's my Beech Nut bunny she's my Red Fox brush hog

She can ride a bareback horse and she can really hook into a bull
She never misses her saddle bronc out and she rides it like a spurrin' fool
She team ropes with the best of them ties a calf in 9.3
She'll dogs steers just for fun and make a fool out of you and me
She's my snoose queen...

Oh well a buckle polisher she's dang sure not
She wins her own in all the tough spots
Chasing cowboys just ain't her style. It's winnin' the prize money that makes her smile
She's got a plug in both her cheeks she's got Copenhagen in her lip
She's got a roll-your-own stuck between her teeth and I've never even seen her spit
She's my snoose queen...

Chris LeDoux,"A rodeo's just a rodeo after riding several years
From ol' Cheyenne to Houston they never cause too much fear
But let me tell you about one that will chill your very soul
It happens in December when it's snowin' and it's cold
In Oklahoma City there's a building of concrete
It's where the toughest stock and men will gather and compete
The points have all been tallied and the stock has all been brought
We've got just two more hours cause it starts at eight o'clock
It's the Finals the NFR the Series of the sport
Hey rookie can you take ten head have you got the heart
You think you're a tough cowboy we'll find out in the end
When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen

The coliseum's quiet except for the sounds
Of cowboys getting ready and the workmen of the grounds
The cowboys ask each other, what each other's got
""Did you draw ol' Necklace or pluck old Double-Ought
The tension now is mounting as the crowd starts pouring in
A shiver goes all through me like from a cold cold wind
I hear the horses comin' runnin' down the alleyway
They're snortin' and a blowin' as men shut the sliding gates
It's the Finals the NFR...

We had too much time a while ago but not enough time now
The Anthem is now over the grand entry's going out
I sit there on my bronc I'm ready and I wait
I hear a chute gate open so I look out through the gate
A horse comes boiling out and blows up at the roof
And then there comes another kicking like a curly wolf
I hear the chute boss holler through the yelling of the crowd
He says there's one ahead of you so you'd better get screwed down
It's the Finals the NFR...

I nod my head, I'm in a daze the horse goes boiling out
I run my spurrs into his neck and then I drag 'em out
My mind is in a blur my eyes are seeing red
The flank catch slams into my back, his rump bangs on my head
From somewhere in the background I can hear a buzzer sound
My hand's jerked from the riggin and I crash into the ground
I stumble to my feet as I stagger to the wall
I wonder to myself is it really worth it all
It's the Finals the NFR...




",National Finals Rodeo,1973
Chris LeDoux,"Old Red was one of the orneriest yet
I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed

From Idaho a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain
And Billy had never been thrown

The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""

Old Red was wicked down there in the chute
He was kickin' and stompin' about
Billy dropped into the saddle with ease
And said, ""Turn him loose let us out""

Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Tryin' to get rid of the man of his back
But the man went wherever he'd go

Billy was rakin' old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doin' right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in

Old Red was bucking straight for the fence
Suddenly stopped in and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him

There was a hush in the crowd
For they knew this would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest
When they fell and under old Red Billy died

Old Red lay still no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell

Out in the west is the place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode",Old Red,1973
Chris LeDoux,"It was dark and I was driving down a lonely Texas road
The night was hot and sleep pulled at my eyes
I was thinking bout the wild times and the women that I'd had
The deceitful things I'd done and those lies

When standin' in the shadows at the side of the road
Stood the figure of a withered old man
He wore a black bandana a ropin' stetson hat
With a two inch scarlet hat band

He held his wrinkled hand up as a sign to shut 'er down
So I pulled over and stopped at his side
He opened up the door slid in and sat down
And said my ain't it hot tonight

I studied this old man and it seemed mighty strange
For him to be out here all alone
And then he started talking and he told me many things
Of times that both of us had known

He told me of the wild life and the women that he'd known
How none of them had ever meant a thing
He told me of a black night much the same as this
Of the strange and awesome things he'd seen
A man beside the road had raised his hand
And flagged him down so he stopped and let him in
That stranger told him stories that I am hearing now
Bout the wild times and all the sin

And the car got cold and clammy and this old man looked at me
He said boy I've come here for you
Your days of wicked sinnin' have come to an end
As a mortal on this earth you are through

Then his eyes got red and firey as he took his stetson off
To reveal his evil horns shiney and black
My God the fear came o'er and my senses were all lost
I fought with him until we finally crashed

Next day they found the car at the bottom of the draw
The young cowboy was found beside the wreck
The car had been consumed by fire
But the cowboy had no marks
Except the smokin' pitchfork brand upon his neck",The Passenger,1973
Chris LeDoux,"At seven this morning I got on the phone
And said to hold my Bronc as long as you can 
My car broke down in Billings and they just got it back together
I'll be photo finishing in to old Cheyenne

We'll here I am in Sheridan and its 9 o'clock in the morning 
And times a going fast
I just pulled her over had some coffee 
And a doughnut and I bought the car a brand 
New tank of gas

Well I don't know if I'm gonna make it, its nine-fifteen 
I'll be lucky if I ever get there
By god what it that I hear, is it a siren, 
Sure enough he got me on his radar
He pulled up behind me and turned on those flashing lights a sign that I knew 

Meant pull it over
So I stomped on my brakes and as I skidded to a halt, 
I wiped out three 
Reflector posts along the shoulder
He got out of his car and was a walking real slow 
So I jumped out and met him 

Half-way
He jerked out his gun and said mister are you crazy, 
I ain't never seen nobody 
Drive that way
I told him take it easy and he could put up that cannon 
The way he was shaking 

It just might go off
He put up the gun as I explained my situation 
He listened to my story then he coughed
He wrote me out a ticket, that seemed to take forever. 
I took it and as I 

Headed for my car
That cop he hollered after me and said hey cowboy 
You better slow down cause 
You can't outrun this radar!
As I rolled on down the road I was a cursing 
About the ticket that I had just acquired

I wondered if I ought to pay it our just throw it out the window, but I might 
Just set the damn thing afire
So I gunned it once again and was a traveling down the highway with the gas 
Pedal a mashed to the floor

When I came around a curve and right there in the highway there was more damn 
Sheep than I ever seen before 
I'm going to fast to ever stop, so I just close my eyes as the car rolls on 
Through the herd

When I opened up my eyes again there's a sheep on the fender and that and that 
Herds saying some mighty awful words 
The sweats a dripping off my hands as I barrel through old Wheatland I'm a 
Nervous wreck and I must be a sight 

The flies inside this old car are buzzing all around me 
Guess my 24-hour deodorant quit last night 
60 50 40 30 20 miles more the rodeo starts in another 18 minutes 
I pull in through the main gate and I hear the anthem playing, 

I can't believe it thank God I finally made it 
There's only one more obstacle a standing in my way. 
Its a nitwit with a weekend badge 
He standing by the gate and as I slide her to a halt, 

He yells where in the hell you going so dog gone fast 
I tell him that I'm entered and I ain't got time to talk 
My horse is in the chute and I'm late 
He says I need to get a pass from the secretary my eyes get red my heart fills 

Up with hate. 
I yell you dirty so and so you better let me through he asked if I'd repeat 
That once again 
So I whacked him in the mouth and a left him lying there on his back a kicking 

In the sand 
I got there just in time to see my Bronc come running out his head and tail was 
A held way up high 
I swear he looked right straight at me and grinned and gave horse laugh and me 
I just stood there and cried I turned around feeling helpless and fairly 

Dumbfounded I looked and what did I see 3 highway patrolmen 
And a gate man with a fat lip 
And  they were all a looking right at me 
Sitting in the cell now I've done a lot of thinking 
About that wild run I made a month ago 

I'm sorry that I'm in this rotten situation

If I could do it again I wouldn't have drove so slow",Photo Finish,1973
Chris LeDoux,"Since I saw that rodeo in 1965
I had to try to be the greatest bareback rider alive
I went and did some practicing on pa's old ropin' mare
And I thought I'd take that bronc I'd drawed
And really part it's hair
When they opened up the gate he did a double flip

Half way through the second one is when I lost my grip
I hooked my spurs into the dees and hung with all my might
I held my breath he chinned the moon
And sucked back to the right
My boots came off and went asailin' right up in the stands
My belt it broke and shattered my watch I lost my wedding band
I scattered all my cigarettes my shirt ripped down the back.
I sure was gettin' dizzy and I thought my neck would crack
I rode him several jumps with both hands high up in the air
He jumped into an old light pole we parted company there
I landed in some muddy slop he stomped right through my side,
I knew he busted all my ribs and made me wanna die

Nothin' ever busted me like that old pony ride
I couldn't seem to catch my breath I couldn't seem to hide
I hobbled back barefooted just a searchin' for my pride

And I just couldn't believe my achin' ears

So tough the devils pitch fork couldn't penetrate his hide
To beat him was the dream of every cowboy in the land
But try they might as sure is right they'll wind up in the sand

A brag came up from Texas by the name of Too Oaks Tall
Was out to get old Badger cause old Too Oaks rode 'em all
He said he'd tie a granny knot in Badger's twisting tail
So thousands came to stake his claim or to see how bad he'd fail

A mighty crowd had gathered with old Badger in the cute
The stirrups felt the boating weight of Too Oaks heavy boots
Then the cute swang open and the crowd began to roar
Cause shirt tail feet upon the seat like waves upon a shore

They circled that area Badger pawing out his hate
But Tall stuck in the saddle like his tail was made of paste
Badger then exploded as his hooves beat on the air
But Tall did stay like children's play in grandmas rockin' chair

The outlaw's eyes were blazin' and old Talls face was turnin' red
They take off to the right but wind up goin' left instead
They busted through the fence and crashed the stillness of the night
They filled the air with dust and hair and vanished out of sight

Some say they died of thirst and time turned them into stone
Others say they withered and buzzards picked their bones
But somewhere on that prairie is a scene we all ain't saw

I was hangin' round town just a spendin' my time out of a job and not earnin' a dime
When a stranger steps up and he says
I suppose you're a bronc rider by the looks of your clothes
I says guess your right there's none I can't tame
If its ridin' wild ponies that my middle name
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
He says he's a cayuse that's never been rode
The guy that gets on him is bound to get throwed
Throwed of that strawberry roan

Out in the horse corral standin' alone is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
Spavined old legs and small pigeon toes pair of pig eyes and a long Roman nose
Little pin ears and they're split at the tip a big forty four brand was on his left hip
So I puts on my spurs and I coils up my twine
Says to that stranger that ten spot is mine
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
I'll break him to saddle or break him my own
I'll ride him until he lies down with a grown
Bring on your strawberry roan

Then I puts on my blinds and it sure is a fight
Next comes the saddle I screws her down tight
Steps up aboard him and rises the blind get out the way boys he's gonna unwind
Shore is a broad walker he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings for to be on the fly
He's the worse buckin' bronco I've seen on the range
Turn on a nickle and give you some change
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan

There's nary a buster from Texas to Nome
Can ride that strawberry roan

Chris LeDoux,"He walked out in the arena all dressed up to the brim
Said he just came down from a place called Highland Rim
And he said he came to ride the horse the one they called the Brute
But he didn't look like a cowboy in the continental suit

We snickered at the way he dressed but he never said a word
Walked on by the rest of us as if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born than the one they called the Brute

The horse that he was lookin' for was in chute number eight
Walked up very slowly put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a purebred when he pulled a sack o' Deuce
From the inside pocket of his continental suit

He rolled himself a quirly and he lit it standin' there
Blew himself a smoke ring and he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy as he opened up the gate
Standin' just inside was fifteen hundred pounds of hate

The buckskin tried to run him down but the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms around the horse's neck
And he pulled himself upon the back of the horse they called the Brute
Sat like he was born there in his continental suit

The Brute's hind end was in the air his front end on the ground
Kickin' and a squealin' tryin' to shake the stranger down
But the stranger wouldn't give an inch he came to ride the Brute
He came to ride that buckskin in a continental suit

I turned around to look at Jim but he was watchin' me
Said I don't believe the crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw the one they call the Brute
Ridden by a cowboy in a continental suit

The Brute came to a standstill ashamed that he'd been rode
By some city cowboy in some continental clothes
The stranger took his money and we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from and we haven't seen him since

To the rich man, poor man, and everybody else but the cowboys in the RCA
Well I get on the phone and call the airlines

Cause I've entered bout thirteen rodeos out across the great big nation
Got the car tuned up

And if I ain't overdrawn by the end of the week
At the bank I'm a lucky man

I'm gonna to hang up my hat
Put up my riggin' sack
And for a month I'm gonna stay right there

Well I've been on the road about three days now
And I haven't had a minutes rest
There's dark circles all around my bloodshot eyes
And my face is now a whiskered mess
Boy I'd sure like a bath and a home cooked meal
But for now I must be satisfied
With this double super-duper half cooked burger
And a side of grease soaked french fries
Well the week's nearly over and I wonder to myself will I ever make it home alive
When a bronc fell on me up in Calgary
When he slipped tryin' to make his high dive
And the plane and the pilot that we rented looked like surplus from World War I
And I thought any times about suicide
But I haven't found myself a gun

Say he you ornery cowboy skunks you better hunt your holes
For I've come up from hells Rim Rock to gather in your souls
Says Sandy Bob old devil be damned we boys is kinda tight
And ya ain't gonna get no cowboy souls without one hell of a fight
So Snady Bob punched a hole in his rope and he swang her straight and true
And he lapped it onto the devils' horns and he taken his dallies too
Now Buster Jiggs was a reita man with his gut line coiled up neat
So he shakes her out and he built him a loop and he lassoed up the devil's hind feet
[ harmonica ]
Well they stretched him out and they tailed him down while the iron was gettin' hot
And they cropped and swallow forked both his ears and they branded him up a lot
They pruned him up whit a dehorning saw and they knotted his tail for a joke
And then rode off and left him there neck to a blackjack oak
So if your ever up high in the Sierra peaks and you hear one hell of a wail
You'll know it's that devil a bellerin' about them knots tied in his tail

You think of what your daddy said if your money should run low
Just call I'll send your busfare to come home
But you're just to proud to take it and home won't be the same
Now you've had a taste of rodeo
You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
To satisfy the hunger in your soul
You wouldn't turn back now even if you could you were born to follow rodeo

All your money's gone cept a twenty dollar bill
But that's your fees to enter old Cheyenne
And all that's in your favor is you and your try
And a deep knawing desperately to win
Ss you step out on the highway with your thumb up in the air
In your mind a promise has been made
If this way of life don't kill you or you don't starve to death
You swear you'll be the champion someday
You set out on the road...

With two eyes like fire brands that glow in the night

And he knows that I'm coming' for him and I just can't rest till I find
That raven black stallion that wears no man's brand with a wild restless spirit like mine
They call him Caballo Diablo half-horse half-devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw up a top the Sierra Madre

Two men before tried to take him they had their chance one by one
But each met his fate when those flashing' black hooves
Brought death 'neath the Mexican sun
Still I can't leave I must find him you fool of a horse can't you see
Well I may be half man but the other half's devil and you're just exactly like me

Even the breezes stopped moving hush now be still
Don't make a sound stay close to the ground cause he's waitin' just over that hill
Downwind behind him move quickly do it fast now he's starting to stir
Grab a handful of mane and up on to his back
And start raking him down with your spurs
But try as he will he can't shake me as over the precipice we go
To shed the life blood of a horse and a man on the rocky sierra below

On a Saturday night I'll have a drink or two
And hollow at the moon I'm country.

As high on living as a noon day sun, yea

You can tell I'm a hick by the way I dress
But that don't matter I'm as happy as can be
And proud as heck that I'm country.
Well there's nothing wrong with city if you like it that's fine
Drivin' them freeways wasting its time,
But I bet you folks in the back of your mind, kinda wish you was country don't

Come on boys keep singing them country songs who knows maybe we will just
Convert some of these city folks into country folks and they'll all move out to
The country and then the country won't be country anymore. hold on

I just gave you one side to the whole picture because
Country is heart and dust and snow where the winters get down to forty below
And the works is hard
And the pay sure low and it ain't all roses being country.
Hang in there folks don't do nothin' foolish now
You got yourself a nice high paying job air conditioned offices
Yea you got movie theaters right on down the street there
You got yourself a city park too, now that's country

Or no abdominal snowman coming down and tearing off your head or nothing like

If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die""

She visits my grave when the night winds wail

And you have stuck by me through all the hard times and the tears
And I know you can't hear me because you don't have any ears

Maybe tomorrow things will get better
If the devil lets loose of his soul
He'll be the All Around Cowboy again

Wipes the whiskers that cover his chin 
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeos

I'm strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
I looks that bull over and to my surprise
Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes

On top of his shoulders, he's got a big hump
I cinched up my rigging just back of that lump 
I lands in his middle and I lets out a scream
He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream

Well, he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
But I ain't no green horn, I'm still sittin' tight

He's a snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes

Well, he needed no help but I had my hands full

Then he goes to fence rowin' and weavin' behind
My head went poppin', I sorta went blind
He starts in high divin', I lets out a groan
We went up together but he come back alone

Up high I turns over and below I can see
He's a pawin' up dirt just a waitin' for me

Sayin' here lies a twister who thought he was good

I notices somethin' don't seem can be true

And all her clothes were gettin' way too small

She'd cook us up some breakfast then we'd sit down there on the grass

Singin' their wild melody

Tried to figure the how and the why

I'm just driftin' and dreamin' and watching the river roll by

And here comes that big ole prairie moon risin'
Shinin' down bright as can be
And up on the hill there's a coyote singin'

I'm inclined to agree but if you ask me you know I'd go through it again

Now what does it take to be a rodeo cowboy I guess I'm a expert at that
Takes a whole lot of guts and old lady luck but not too much under this hat
Well he thrives on the crowds yellin' real load for him to face dyin' again
But the good Lord takes care of children and fools
He's no kid so what's that make him
Now where is the glory...




",Where Is the Glory,1980
Chris LeDoux,"Well Lord I love this ranchin' with it's ropin' and brandin'
But I don't like that farmin' at all
It's goodby for the summer this haying's sure a bummer
And I'll be back to help you gather in the fall
Well I don't mind riding fences but them tractors are wrenches
I ain't never liked and I guess I never will
Just give me my horse and saddle or some woolies or some cattle
And turn me loose and let me ride out through the hills
Cause I'm just a cowboy a dirt and sweat cowboy
Livin' on beef steak and beans
I ain't to hard to please but Mister you better believe
I ain't never had no use for farm machines

Well there ain't much romancing in old fashioned branding
But Lorrie it suits me just fine
Oh the dust and the smoke's enough to make a feller choke
But have you ever had to ride one of them old combines
Now my grandpa was a farmer a Michigan black land farmer
And he worked with them machines the whole day through
But I bet if he did some roaming through the hills of old Wyoming
He'd probably feel about the same way that I do

I reckon it's just bad fate I was born a hundred years too kate
And they say boy if you want to survive you'd better change
But as long as sagebrush grows and that old Powder River flows
I'll be a cowboy till my dyin' day
I'm just a cowboy...
Well I think I just heard a discouraging word
About them rattleing banging smoking farm machines




",Dirt and Sweat Cowboy,1980
Chris LeDoux,"Braided rope saddle soap rosin for his riggin'
A young man dreams of growing up to ride
Buckin' broncs Brahma bulls is just some wishful thinkin'
Cause that cowboy well he's still too young to ride
Leather chaps a big white hat silver spurs that glisten
Growin' up takes such a long long time
And he could ride the rankest bronc if only they would listen
How that cowboy's dreams sound a lot like mine
Dream on cowboy your trophy buckles're waitin'
You got the world by the reins and you've got time on your side
Dream on cowboy there's not a thing in your way now
So don't wait 'til it's too late to saddle your dreams and ride
[ guitar ]
The time has past and looking back the rodeo has ended
The cowboys and the fans have all gone home
But broken hearts and broken bones and time will all be mended
But the mem'ries of this cowboy's life live on
Dream on cowboy...




",Dream on Cowboy,1980
Chris LeDoux,"I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
Lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days

I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well your best days are gone

Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, an' old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
",My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,1980
Chris LeDoux,"I used to want to be a cowboy
Spent my childhood dreamin' that
Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
And a big ten-gallon hat
Chasin' outlaws savin' ladies
Bustin' broncs at rodeos
Riding off into the sunset
Like they do in picture shows

I used to want to be a cowboy
I dreamed about it until the day
That a green-eyed Texas lady
Smiled and stole my heart away
Now I'm trackin' down a livin'
And as far as I can see
Right now I'm just as much a cowboy
As I'm ever gonna be

'Cause my round-ups at a truck stop
The trails a super slab
I wear boots up in the saddle
Of my eighteen wheelers cab
Riding hell bent for the bunkhouse
Just across the Georgia line
Where tonight I'll see my lady
And that little boy of mine

And he wants to be a cowboy
And you know somehow I kind of expected that
Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
I used to want to be a cowboy
And all my cowboy dreams are livin'
In that little buckaroo
Cowboys often end up daddies
You know I'm really glad they do

And he wants to be a cowboy
Just the way his daddy did
When he's on his broomstick pony
He's Hoppy, Roy and Sisco Kid

You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts
Is your best bet

And it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado, well, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you wild
And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
When the sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences and open the gate
It may be rainin' but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late

",Desperado,1982
Chris LeDoux,"Now the redheaded stranger, from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
Between his knees was a raging black stallion
Walkin' behind was a bay
Now the redheaded stranger had eyes like the thunder
His lips were sad and tight
Cause his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

[Chorus]
So don't boss him
Don't cross him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hidin' his pain
Don't fight him 
Don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

Now the yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her away
She drew back at fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But she didn't know that the dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life
Cause this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife

[Chorus]

Now the yellow-haired lady went down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
When he bought her some drinks, and he gave her some money
But she just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled the stallion
And he laughed when she grabbed for the bay
Well he shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

[Chorus]

Now the yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
Cause you can't hang a man for shootin' a woman
Who's tryin' to steal your horse
Now this is the tale of the redheaded stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay",Red Headed Stranger,1982

For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Listen to that Norther sigh, if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only seven miles to Mary Ann
It's only seven miles to Mary Ann

You can bet we're on her mind 'cause it's nearly supper time
And I'll bet there's hot biscuits in the pan
Lord, my hands feel like their froze, there's a numbness in my toes
But there's only five more miles to Mary Ann

That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's screams
We best be movin' faster if we can

Well, Dan, get up you ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
Well, I'm so weary but I'll help ya if I can
Well, all right Dan, perhaps it's best that we stop a while and rest
For it's still a hundred yards from to Ann
It's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann

Well, late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
Well, he'd a made it but he just couldn't leave old Dan

I spied a young cowboy just ridin' along
His hat was throwed back and his spurs were a jinglin'
And as he approached he was singin' this song

Yippy ti yi yo get along little doggies you know that Wyoming will be your new home

Chris LeDoux,"Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone
It was long late in the evening when he rode into our camp
On a little old brown pony he called Shaw
In his brogan shoes and coveralls a harder lookin' kid
You never in you life have seen before

His saddle was a Sother kack built many years ago
An OK spur on one foot idly hung
With his bed roll in a cotton sack was loosely tied behind
And a canteen from the saddle horn he'd slung
Said he had to leave his home because his paw had married twice
His new maw beat him every day or two
So he saddled up old Shaw one night and lit a shuck this way
Thought he'd try and paddle now his own canoe

Said he'd try to do the best he could if we'd only give him work
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow
So the boss he cut him out a mount and kinda put him on
And we knew he liked our little stray somehow
Well he taught him how to heard the horses and learned to know 'em all
And to get 'em in by daylight if he could
And to follow the chuck wagon and to always hitch the team
And to help the carsonaro rustle wood

We had driven to Red River and the weather it was fine
We were camped down on the south side of the bend
When a Norther started blowin' we called the extra guard
Cause it took all hands to hold the cattle in
Now little Joe the wrangler was called out like the rest
Barely had the kid got to the heard
When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they flew
With all of us a ridin' for the lead

Between the streaks of lightnin' we could see a horse ahead
It was little Joe the wrangler in the lead
He was riding old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head
And he's trying to check the leaders in their speed.
We finally got'em millin' and they sort of quieted down
The extra guard back to the camp did go
But one of them was missing and we all knew at a glance
Twas our little Texas strayboy wrangler Joe

We found him there at sun up where old Blue Rocket fell
In some washout twenty feet below
Beneath his horse smashed to a pulphis spur had rung the knell
For our little Texas stray bos wrangler Joe
Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp

To help me through the trials of this life
But there's one thing I can't do with out and Copenhagens what I'm talkin'
About and I love it nearly as much as I love my wife
Now when I first started chewin' I didn't know what I was doin'
But I liked the way it helped me to relax
And a big ol' chew tastes might good just the way I know Copenhagen should
But when its gone I'm a slobbering maniac
I'm a Copenhagen junkie there's a big ol' hairy monkey on my back
And it just won't let me be
Cause when I run out of chewin' I know I'm on the road to ruin
That Copenhagen's got a hold on me

I can go without a lot of things like sweet potatoes and butter beans
And you know if wouldn't really bother me at all
I can go without coffee for a couple of days but if you take my s'noose away
I'll be climbing like the spider up the wall
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...

Well I even tried to quit one time my knees got weak I sorta went blind
And my mellow disposition headed south
I started eating like a big fat hog got wild got mean like a rabid dog and
Start frothin' and foamin' at the mouth

Take along my fishing pole and leave my cares behind
And find myself a little piece of mind
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain live like a mountain man
Lay my body on the ground eat from a fryin' pan
I know it's not the answer but I'm gonna try to lose
These dog gone low down workin' cowboy blues

Well next year it might get better aw that's what they always say
But I've seen a string of next years come and Lord they're all the same

Chris LeDoux,"Headed for Wyoming, in 1882..a woman, a team, and a wagon.
Gonna make our dreams come true.
Settled in the foothills of the big horn mountain slope.
Life is sweet we lived on the meat, of the deer and the antelope.
We cut house logs on the mountain, with the team we hauled 'em down.
Peeled 'em and we stacked 'em up, for a house and bought some ground.
Traded for some cattle, and turned 'em out on the range.
The skies were blue and we never knew...how things were gonna change.
Ole powder river, you're muddy and wide, how many men have died...upon
Your shores.
When you brand a man a rustler, he's gotta take a side.
There's no middle ground in this Johnson country war.
Well, the neighbors stopped by yesterday, while I was outside choppin'
Some wood.
And they filled me in on the local news, ain't none of it sounded good,
Said, they'd been some cattle stealin', by some no count outlaw bands.
We'd all been branded rustler's by the big ranchers of this land.
Well it was us against the cattlemen, and the years just made it worse.
First the drought, then the tough winter, Johnson county had been dealt
A curse,
Then their came the story about the two dry golgia tax.
Ranger Jones and John Tisdale both been shot in the back
Oh, powder river, you're muddy and you're wide,
How many men have died upon your shores.
When you brand a man a rustler, he's gotta take a side.
There's no middle ground in this Johnson county war.
Then last night at supper time, riders stopped by chance.
They said cattleman and hired guns, just burned the Kaycee ranch,
Two men had died this mornin', shot down in the snow.
Now the vigilante army was marchin' for buffalo.
Well the county was in an uproar, an every man saddled up to ride.
Caught the cattlemen at the ta ranch, and surrounded all four sides.
We hailed the house with bullets and swore we'd make 'em pay.
But the cavalry came across the plains, and once again saved the day.
Well, they marched 'em off to Cheyenne, and no one went to jail.
The cattlemen we're all turned loose, and the hired guns hit the trail.
And I guess the only justice, wasn't much to say the least.
Last winter me and mine ate mighty fine on the cattle baron's beef.
Oh powder river, you're muddy and you're wide.

But he looked to them just like a bearded man, in a coat of grizzly

He laid his hand down and looked around, and said nobody touch that pot.

He walked out to the bar room and the trouble began,
An' his blood ran cold when he saw the rose, in the arms of the tall

Chris LeDoux,"The ole man stand by the lone chute, he sold his calves t'day.
He spits in the dust between his boots, as the semi pulls away.
The slick blue check in his grimy hands, shoves down in his coat.
It won't make the payment on the land, or pay the interest on the note.
Oh, it's hard, hard times
He's a young man with a loving wife, two children and a home.
Plans to build a better life, and put a mortgage on his own.
He lost his job when the boom went bust, still got bills to pay.
Now he's pickin' up cans in the roadside dust, she's at the feed-rack
Cafe.
Oh, it's hard, hard times
Now the ole grey banker sits behind his desk, beneath a worried frown.
Of the tangled mess of some good folks goin' down.
He's known some of 'em for thirty years, and some point the finger of blame.
An' no one sees his tears, except the one who shares his name.

Chris LeDoux,"Rolling down a long highway
Out through New Mexico
Drifting down to Santa Fe 
To ride a bull in a rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin'
Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's a feelin'
All he knows is he's got to ride

[Chorus]
He's addicted to danger
Rule out passion and pride
To pain and fear is no stranger
When his lust needs to be satisfied
Hooked on a eight-second ride

Getting up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
Got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate
He settles down inside
The tensions risin' but he can't wait 
'Till they turn that bull outside

Chris LeDoux,"I walked behind the chute, stapped my spurs to my boots
At that big Rodeo in Cheyenne.
Feelin' tired and sore for a ride the day before,
And a thousand other rides since I began.

As I climbed up the gate I heard that young cowboy sayin',
Well, that ole man ain't gonna ride, and I had to smile.
I said son it ain't age that makes me look this way,
It ain't the years boy...it's the miles.

It ain't the years that I've known that have taken their toll,
'Cause they've been few.
If you took all the mashin's, the draggin's and the crashin's,
You'd probably look the same way I do.

It's the million miles of road, and gettin' snatched around and throwed,
That finally put the cramp in my style.
It ain't the years boy...it's the miles.
Went on and made my ride, only scored a 65.

But you know what really made my day complete,
Was when I looked up just in time to see that young cowboy goin' flyin',
And land in a pile at my feet.
And as the first aid came to haul him away, I said son you'll be

Allright in a little while.
He's on his way to findin' out what it's all about.
It ain't the years boy...it's the miles.
It ain't the years that I've known that've taken their toll.

With country music blastin' on the radio.
Talkin' girls and broncs and gold beltbuckles.
Rollin' south to a california rodeo.

Just rollin' down that great american highway,
With the mornin' sky lit up like a flame.
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow.
Like children runnin' through the rain.

Well it's rodeo time in oakdale, california.
And we stumble with the trash out of the car.
And ole bill looks at me through whiskers and wild, red eyeballs,
And says, we look more like hobo's than big-time rodeo stars.

Well we ride our broncs and we all win a little money.
And there's witch over at the beer stand again.
But look, he's got his arm around a little california honey.

Chris LeDoux,"When he was five years old his mom took him down to the round corral
To watch his dad work the young horse they called Smokey man did that horse buck
But his old dad just sat up there and rode him like there was nothin' to it
Right then the boy gained a whole new respect for the man
And from that day on he knew that when he grew up he wanted to be a cowboy

Seventeen cowboys' dreams ain't on fixin' fences
Once he's seen 'em ride in old Cheyenne
Ranch routine and his old man's schemes
This ain't where his heart is but you know his daddy understands
Noonday comes father and son sit down and eat their dinner
Beneath that big Wyoming sky
His daddy knows he's gotta let him go the boy can't be a winner
If he don't spread his wings and fly
And in his mind he's riding bulls down in Las Vegas
Soon he'll be on a train that leads to Santa Fe
Sweet voice of freedom echoes down the ages calls another cowboy on his way

Fencin's done and the morning sun finds him packed and ready
Momma kissed his cheek and then she went inside
His old man well he shook his hand said son you ride 'em pretty
Didn't see the tears that his momma cried
And in his mind he's riding...

Chris LeDoux,"So you wanna be a cowboy and you wanna rodeo
Well I don't see nothin' to hold you back just pack your stuff and go
You'll travel many highways and boy you're gonna see it all
You'll have yourself some good times but you're gonna take some falls
Now lay off the hard liquor leave them pills alone
They'll only dull the senses and leave you weak and stoned
If you wanna be a winner son you better play it straight
Give it everything you got when they open up the gate
Well there ain't no easy goin on the rodeo trail
For every man that's made it a hundred men have failed
But if you're mighty lucky and you gotta lot of try
There's a big gold buckle waitin at the end of the line

Now if you got a woman son you better know her well
Cause it takes a special lady to follow you through hell
But if she'll stand beside you when you're down to your last dime
You've got yourself a treasure that few men ever find
Well there ain't no easy...

Chris LeDoux,"Well way out west where the wild wind blows the eagle flies and the sage brush grows
Traditions are holding on you'll be glad to hear
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
Like that young cowboy from old Montana got boots and spurs and a black bandana
He rides the wild prairie rounding up the steers
Just like his Daddy he's a son of The Pioneers
From Texas clear up the Idaho from the mountains to the plains
They got the blood of Crockett and Geronimo flowing through their veins
Now the wild old west is changing some but traditions persevere
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
[ piano - fiddle ]
There's a gal down in Texas with a great big hat
She likes roping and dancing and things like that
And if you need a hand at your branding she'll volunteer
She's a wild prairie flower and a daughter of the Pioneers
He's got braids and hat with an eagle feather
He rides with broncs there ain't none better
And his great grandaddy was a chief on the wild frontier
And he's a proud son of the original Pioneers
Well from Texas clear up the Idaho...

I lay my bed roll down at night out on the range
Cussin' dust and heat and fly's and cattle
All this romance can drive a poor cowboy insane
And that lonesome coyote's a howlin' on the prairie
And that big Wyoming moon is shinnin' down
Well it's Saturday night and you know its customary
For a wild and wooly cowboy to ride to town

Well I just got paid and my pockets are full of money
I can't stand no more I can't wait another day
I got to ride to town I gotta see my little green eyed honey
We're going to dance and romance and love the night away
And that lonesome coyote's...
I'm gettin' sick and tired of just sleepin' on the ground
Come on Buck let's go to town




",Wild and Wooly,1990
Chris LeDoux,"While driving down the last four miles of gravel road to home
All the old familiar landmarks seem like long lost friends
As he pulls in to the ranch he see's his mom hangin' out the wash
And dad is ridin' down the old yellow with old smokie
He never realized what a good cook his mom was
I guess he took a lot of things for granite
But for the past year he has been living on blogne burgers and beans
And he thinks he just might stay home for awhile
Well there's a dance in town tonight
And he figures he'll just go in and see some of his old friends
Well he runs into Bill and John and they ask
Where all he's been and about the bulls
Well then from behind him he hears someone call his name
He turns around to see a beautiful young lady
He doesn't recognise him at first but then it dawns on him
This is the same skinny little girl who use to tag along with him back in high school
My how the flowers grow well they danced and talked about things
And somewhere around midnight for the first time in his life
The cowboy realizes he is fallin' in love
And you know what I guess it was bound to happen




",Homecoming,1991
Chris LeDoux,"While I was out a ridin'
The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn
The moon was bright as a readin' light

Why do you ride for your money
and why do you rope for short pay
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And you're loosin' your share
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there

He said last night he runn in to Jenny
She's married and has a good life
And boy you sure missed the track
When you never come back
She's the perfect professional's wife

And she asked him
Why does he ride for his money
And tell me why does he rope for short pay
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And he's loosin' his share
Well he must've gone crazy out there

Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing

Well I read up the last of my letter
And tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and grinned

He said you know I wonder
Why do they ride for their money
Tell me why do they ride for short pay
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And they're loosin' their share
Son, they all must be crazy out there

Somethin' in me said boy move on

You'll be waitin' at the end and I know
And I'll say to hell with that pot of gold

But in my heart he knows there's just one desire
He's gonna take me to the end of the road

I headed down the road last summer; with a few good friends of mine
They all hit the money, Lord; I didn't make a dime.
The entry fees they took my dough; the travelin' took my time;
And I'm headed home; to my Sweet Wyoming Home

Hum a tune; Prairie lullaby; 
Hear the wind; And old coyotes cry
A song of home; Sweet Wyoming Home

But your money's ridin' on the bull; and he don't give a damn
Well there's shows in all the cities; cities turn your heart to clay
Takes all a man can muster; just to try and get away
The songs I'm used to hearin'; ain''t the kind the jukebox play
And I'm headed home; To my Sweet Wyoming Home

Well I've always loved the ridin'; there ain' t nothing quite the same
Another year might bring me luck; win in another game
There's a magpie on a fence rail; that's callin' out my name
And he calls me home, To my Sweet Wyoming Home

From the days at the Terrace Ballroom well me made it up to Symphony Hall
I played my songs and you sang along and man we really had a ball
And you brought your little children and I've seen 'em all grow tall

And I've heard every song on the Bill Mack show purd near fifty times
And a little green man on a motorcycle passed a little while ago

Lets drive up get out and get on another one and boy you better win

I've been tipped to a truck-stop waitress 
Taped where I was torn
And in the hand of a child I was laid on a plate 
In a church on Sunday morn

[Chorus]
They say I'm the root of all evil 
I bring lust, power and greed
But this Workin' Man's Dollar only buys the things 
A workin' man really needs

Well, they say I'm worth about fifty-cents 
In this modern inflated age
But don't tell that to the young man slavin' 
To make it on a minimum wage
Or that single workin' mother 
She's been scapin' to make ends meet
To make a house a home 
Keep food on the table 
And shoes on her baby's feet
Well, I know my days are numbered 
I'm gettin' threadbare and wearin' thin
And they'll replace me with another 
But I'd do it all again
'Cause I've seen this great big country
Passed from hand to callused hand
And I've got to say that I'm mighty proud 
That I belong to a workin' man

There's a star that you've been wishin' on.
Well is the grass really that much greener,
Than here where you belong?
I hope that you find what you're after,
And I hope all of your dreams come true,
Just remember I'll always be here,
When your yellow brick road turns blue.
You say that you're having trouble,
Tellin' me why you can't stay.
It's not that you don't really love me,
It's just the winds of change are blowin' your way.
I know there's a road that you must follow,
But my heart won't give up on you.
So remember I'll always be here,
When your yellow brick road turns blue.
Somewhere, far away, you think you'll find your dreams,
But sometimes that ole pot of gold,
Isn't always what it seems.
So if you ever find yourself lonely,
And things don't work out like you planned.
You'll know there's a place to come home to,
And that I will always understand.
I hope that you find what you're after.
I hope all of your dreams come true

When your yellow brick road turns blue.

The lightning's flashing across the mountain side
The thunder's rollin' down the canyons of his mind

He hungers for the freedom of an eagle as she flies

Puttin' in his hours workin' overtime

That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll

Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes

Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah
[ keyboards ]
Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control

Chris LeDoux,"Seven years old on a gold palomino I sat up tall with my face to the wind
I'd seen the rodeo cowboys in Reno so I dug in my boot heels and pulled on the reins
And Blaze he took off a running he threw me down off the side
Then my Uncle Jim picked me up once again said get back on that pony and ride
Get back on that pony and ride

So lift up your head boy I know how you're feeling
You say you won't ride with a chance you might lose
You fallen from love and your head is still reeling
Your heart and your pride have been shaken and bruised
And like Blaze she took off a running...

I'm not saying forget what you lost I suppose there's a purpose in pain
What we make of ourselves has a cost
And it's paid every time we take hold of the reins

So dust off your blue jeans get back in the saddle losing's a place to start over again
Gettin' back up there is half of the battle
And love like a pony should race with the wind
And like Blaze it takes off a running...

And I owe a lotta people in a lot of different ways for making me what I am
But the one thing that I'm most thankful for I guess it was a stroke of good luck
Is when the Lord looked down on this great big world and made those horses that buck

Well, I wonder what my life would be like today if not for them buckin' old broncs
I guess I'd be tied to desk and a phone or workin' at some old gas pumps
Well I know that I can't ride forever but I'll do it just as long as I can

As folks come from miles around
They'll be roarin' all night till the dawns early light
When the big rodeo comes to town

Well there ain't no top names of rodeo fame no Tibbs nor Larry Mahans
Just some local cowboys out to make 'em some noise
But they know everyone in the stands
They're clean and they're wild with tobacco stained smiles
And they don't care if they make a dime
If they win or they lose well they don't give a hoot
They're out just to have a good time

There's cowboys and ladies and old folks and babies
And young girls with stars in their eyes
Flashy bronc riders and whisker'ed old timers tellin' their stores and lies
There's cold beer and Brandy and pink cotton candy
When it's all over they'll all head on down
To the rodeo dance some midnight romance
When the big rodeo comes to town

The bands playing loud to that dance hall crowd
As boots stir the dust on the floor
At the bar they're playin' old Willie and Whalen
As beers disappear by the score
But hangovers I'll bet they'll soon forget

Chris LeDoux,"Well I used to laugh with an old friend till the busy world pulled him away
Every now and then I see him again but he's not the same man I knew yesterday
His smile just grows smaller and smaller and the worry lines fill up his face
But lately I'm thinking the next time I see him just what I'm gonna say
Slow down man in the mirror slow down
You're running too fast to see what life's all about
This world ain't a fire for you to put out
The best times are here and now slow down

Some days I look back on the hard times and they really don't seem all that bad
Well I've got to admit I like what I've got but God I sure loved what I had
But it's only on top of the mountain after burning your life at both ends
You look back to see where you want to be is exactly where you've always been

Chris LeDoux,"Well it's Saturday night,
Your all dressed up in blue.
I've been watchin' you a while,
Maybe you've been watchin' me too.
So somebody ran out,
Left somebody's heart a mess.
Well if you're lookin' for love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Some girls they want a handsome Dan,
Or some good lookin' Joe,
On their arm some girls want a sweet talkin' Romeo.
But round here baby,
I've learned you get what you can get,
So if your lookin' for love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Oh your road is dark, 
And there's a thin thin line,
But I want you to know,
I'd walk it for you anytime.
And all your other boyfriends,
They couldn't pass the test.

Honey I'm Tougher than the rest.

Chris LeDoux,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Chris LeDoux,"The Calico Moon was rising that night
Shining like gold on the water
Me and my brother we hijacked a row boat
Set out like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer

Oars dippin' diamonds
As we rowed across the lake
An owl sang to who knows who
Lost in the wonder, under the Calico Moon

The calico moon lay soft on your skin
It was a night that I'll always remember
Our hearts filled with fire, holding each other

Love flowed as wild as the river
We talked of how we were meant to be
And how sometimes dreams do come true
We were young lovers, under the Calico Moon

Now that old moon has rolled around
So many times since then
And here we are still gazing at the night
We're captured in the magic of its spell again
You and I

The Calico Moon wakes in the East
And hangs on an amber horizon
When I see its light dance in your eyes
It reminds me of how lucky I am

Where would I be if I didn't have you?
Lord only knows what I'd do
Thank God in heaven for you
And the Calico Moon

Now when I look at my own sons I see what my father went through
There's only so much you can do

You're proud when they walk scared when they run
That's how it always has been between fathers and sons
It's a bridge you can't cross it's a cross you can't bear
It's the words you can't say the things you can't change

No matter how much you care
So you do all you can then you gotta let go
You're just part of the flow of the river that runs between fathers and sons

Now your mother she'll try to protect you she'll hold you as long as she can
But the higher you climb the more you can see
And that's something I understand

One day you'll look at your own son there'll be so much that you want to say
But he'll have to find his own way

Watch the cattle
As they bend down
Back at the wagons

Right after supper
Spread the bed rolls
On the ground
Me an willie

We took the night guard
And the sage
Never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon

Was blazin silver
No chance tonight
For stampede
We rode off yonder

In the distance
Towards the mountains
There in the west
Then I see lightening

And I hear thunder 
My mind is weary I could use some rest
Then all at once
The wind shifts directions

The clouds roll in 
Behind the tumble weeds
These longhorn cattle 
Are gettin restless 

God help us all
If they stampede
Smell the rain 
And hear the thunder

The midnight sky
Turns balck as death
Lightening crashes
Smell the sulfur

It's rank and strong
As satan's breath
The cattle rise up
And go around

I steer my pony
On to take a lead
And across the heard
I can hear willie yellin

Hey stampede
Dust clouds ride
As the rain falls
They mix together

Turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns
Brush against me
And I can feel the demons

Racin through my blood 
And all at once
My pony stumbles
We hit the ground

And I rise
Up to my knees
And flash a light
I can see the cattle comin

Lord I know
I'm gonna die
In this stampede
Then I wait

And I look around
I'm in my bed roll
And I;m layin on the ground
Over there's a wagon

And there's the campfire
I was only dreamin
But what's that sound
Then I feel the earth

Tremble beneath me
As the midnight sky
Begins to bleed
And from the blackness

Say it with your heart, your soul, and believe it, and I'll say, Amen.""

Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need

He said, ""Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again.
I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet.
Well I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet.""

Just another man who's searchin' for a better way

Racing toward the Rio, running out of time
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline

Well the law-man wanted justice, the cowboy needs revenge
They tracked the outlaws' horses up to the water's edge
There across the Rio, a badge ain't worth a dime
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the border line

So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail
Destiny begins, heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time, on the borderline

In the safety of the Badlands, the outlaws stopped their run
The campfire rings (I think, maybe rages) 
With laughter of the evil things they've done
How they've taken all they wanted and they 
Killed the cowboy's wife, they knew no one would 
Follow them across the borderline

Now the lawman and the cowboy stepped out of the dark

Chris LeDoux,"His name was Twister he lived in the pasture
Right down from my daddy's farm
They say there's a cowboy who once tried to ride him
Now he's mending fences with only one arm

On my way home from school somehow he always knew
Just when I'd come walking by
And he'd stand at the gate like the keeper of fate
And we both knew that one day I'd just have to ride

Now one crack of dawn well I slipped my boots on
And walked out towards that just rising sun
My heart skipped a beat when I heard his four feet
Pounding down on the red dirt like it was a drum

He walked up against me as if to convince me
His heart was easily tamed
Then I came to staring up at the blue and the black
With a handful of mane

Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky, I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride

Well, the years have gone by since that morning I climbed
On that shadow that cut through the fields
My shoulder still hurts when the weather turns worse
Sometimes you find the strength in the wounds that don't heal

Between horses and heartaches, women and mistakes
I've been through more than I should
But I strapped a saddle across every battle
And held on as long as I could

Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky, I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride

Chris LeDoux,"Well a few years back me and ol' John worked the Calgary rodeo. 
We were hangin' around town with nothing to do, nowhere else to go. 
Cowboys are known for their fun loving ways, pranks, and practical jokes. And I'll never forget the night we impressed a bunch of them Calgary folks. Well just down the hall in the ole hotel where me and old John stayed. 
Were some school marms, they'd come up from Dallas to party for a couple of days. 
Now these old gals was fancy dressers; they had wigs and beads and all. 
So we put on the hair, took off our boots, and boogied on down the hall. Well, you could never tell we were cowboys; we were real lookin' hippies by heck. With long hair, bare feet, old t-shirts, and beads around our necks. And shoot we just had to show someone so we boogied on down to the lounge. There was cowboys, and gents in nice old suits and ladies in long evening gowns. Well we found us a table, pulled out a chair and lit up some Bull Durham smokes. The smoke filled the air, everyone there thought these hippies were smokin' dope. Now Leonard and Cravy and old Ronnie 
Rosland were sitting two tables away. So we did what we thought hippies would do when we noticed them lookin' our way. Well we waved our long hair, rolled back our eyes, and sucked in them home made smokes. Sayin' stuff like cool and ya, man wow. We put on one heck of a show. Now Ronnie and Lenard, they'd been there a while and they wasn't feelin' much pain. I reckon they figured they'd have some fun with these two hippie freaks that walked in. Well the bar got deathly quiet, as those cowboys come our way. And the city folks knew it wouldn't be long till the battle got under way. Well Ronnie came right over to me and looked me right square in the eye and said, hey there boy, what's that stuff you're smokin' I Said, here man give it a try. Well that didn't make him too happy, and then when I told him to bug out he blinked and snorted like a mad brahamer bull, frolicked and foamed at the mouth. Well just about then, I looked at old John and his face had turned beat red, cause Leonard had grabbed him by the throat with plans to tear off his head! Ronnie reached out with a huge left hand and grabbed a hold of my hair. With a right fist cocked, he said now boy you better start sayin' your prayers!
Well he gave a yank and my wig come off and lay limp there across his hand. 
The most stupified look I've never seen on the face of any man. Well he 
Dropped the thing like a poisonous snake and stared at it there on the floor. 
The he looked up and saw who I was, he laughed, and gave out a roar!

Well this story doesn't have any moral; it was just one mighty good gag. But I sighed with relief Ronnie didn't swing first before he pulled off my wig.",Hippies in Calgary,2000

Bus headed north one headed south
I call a farm in Colorado
And I lift a dusty pay phone to my mouth

Tell the kids their old man's through with playin' rodeo
Cause if it's alright with you I'm comin' home

Well there's silence on the line

But I still need a man for the things a man is good for

A boy that needs a whippin' and a hundred things to do
I hope you've finally found your mind
To leave that rodeo behind
I've spent half my life just waitin' here for you

I guess that nows the time I'd better tell her
Hon I've got this old friend that's here with me
He used to be a cowboy and a good one so they say
But now his legs are crippled he can't walk you see
But hon you ought to hear him tell his stories
Sing the old songs play the guitar too
I'd really like to show him colorado
But I thought I'd better leave it up to you

Well there's silence on the line
And now I hear her sayin'
Babe I only need a man for the things a man is good for
And you know how it is a place just half this big
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
Put yourself in his place it'd awful hard to face

Gold buckles in my eyes

That I used to call my friend

But I don't want to mention any names

He's made suggestions I don't like at all
And I'm trying to let him know that
I'm wise to his game, but I don't wanna mention any names

And if he don't back off there's gonna be some trouble

Chris LeDoux,"I was six years old, my brother was ten
One July day came runnin' in
Seen a Ferris wheel at the edge of town
So, of course, we headed on down

Well, it took us an hour to walk that far
Carryin' our fortune in a Mason jar
It was all pretty sad, a cheap county fair
With a few old rides but there was ponies there

Well, the ponies stunk and the air was still
In that dusty circle behind the ferris wheel
This old guy smellin' of smoke and rum
Swung me up and sat me down on one

Well, I'd never rode a horse but I'd seen it done
Cowboy movies made it look like fun
This old man whispered a few soft words
It was the best advice I've ever heard

He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""

I went up a kid with shakin' hands
But I came down a full grown man
It was like he'd cast some voodoo spell
Things were different for me now, I could tell

'Cause whenever troubles come wanderin' in
His rhyme would pop in my head again
And somehow I rode through the needles and nails
Brambles and thorns that life entails

He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""

Well, I know some day, farther down the road
I'll come to the edge of the great unknown
There'll stand a black horse riderless
And I wonder if I'm ready for this

So I'll saddle him up and he'll switch his tail
And I'll tip my hat and bid farewell
And lift my song into the air
That I learned at that dusty fair

Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride

Changes with each mile like a radio tune

Wearing tattered old boots with one sole gone and a far away look in his eye
Well he watched for a while as she painted and then he said mama you surely paint well
Yes you got all this on your canvas the dirt the squalor and the hell
Well she asked to paint him in the setting ah but he shook his head slowly and low
He said naw I won't fit your picture unless you can paint be back home
Can you paint me back home in Wyoming riding free neath the big sky above
Free as the wind on the prairie out in the hills that I love
I long to get back to Wyoming and I've hoped all these years that I can
Please paint me back home on your canvas paint me back in Wyoming again

Well I never claimed this festered city
You know I was raised on a ranch out in the west
I spent my young years bustin' horses and boy they said I could ride with the best
So I came here to Madison Square Garden to ride in the big rodeo
Ah but I got stepped on and all crippled up and chute bronc bustin' is all I know
Ah boy if I could just get back to Wyoming I wouldn't feel so alone
Ah but the pain is too much for the roamin' so please can you paint me back home

I want to hear the meadow lark singin' this cowboy's favorite song
I want to saddle up old paint and just ride him out across the hills
I belong in old Wyoming and I reckon that I always will

Everytime that I pack my suitcase it gets harder to drive away
The look that I see in my little girls eyes is beggin' me to stay

He's never been a hero and he probably never be one
But in his heart he knows he gave his all

If Lady Luck had smiled on you at all

He gives it all he's got but it's never quite enough
Oh the Lord and him alone know how he's tried
But he'll try and try again although he'll never win
And all that he's got goin' is his pride

The bones are just too tough and he doesn't have enough
Of what it takes to make it to the top
What makes him want to go well Lord I guess I know
He loves it too damn much to ever stop

Then he stumbles to the chutes to ease the pain
And underneath his breath he cusses to himself
I'll ride him if I get the chance again

And of all the girls I've known she's the truest one I've found.


Well, she'll cut 'em and she'll head 'em just the way you want 'em

And if you drop your loop around 'em, she can make a grass rope hum,

And any time you got a rodeo, and I've got the entry fee,

You can bet your boots my gal and I will come.

That young pony was born to work the trail.

Some old idaho rawhider was the first one tried to ride her,

Bronco buster, wild horse rustler, well she flipped him off like a
Turkey feather duster.


Now, some folks like a cadillac with power brakes and air,
Just give me a hamlee saddle and my little buckskin mare.


Well, I rode her up a mountain when we made that summer drive,
And I [g]took her to wyomin? for a rodeo or two,
At old cheyenne and saratoga, we roped them little dogies,
She the best ole gal this cowboy ever knew.


When she gets to old to rodeo too old to ride the range,
I'll take the buckskin lady out across the open plains.


Cause she's just an ole cow pony and I know she'd go plum crazy
If she had to stand unsaddled around the barn the whole day through
I'll just turn her loose to ramble underneath them rocky mountains
And tell 'em that her workin? days are through.

Chris LeDoux,"Now back in old Wyoming, many long years ago
When there was no law and order 'round to regulate the show
Those old Wyoming ranchers had a problem on their hands
Trying to keep the cow thieves and the rustlers off their land

Now old Tom Horn came a riding up one day
Gonna lend a hand to the cattlemen in his own peculiar way
Well, he took his 44-40 out and cleaned it up right well
Then he rode off down Dry Gulch with a sack of rifle shells

Old Tom Horn with a rifle by his side
Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

If you rode the Laramie Valley, by either day or night
You can be right sure he's watchin' you through his rifle sights
He laid out in the bushes and the rustler come around
Then he'll spill the boy with a single shot and chamber one more round

Now the rustlers tried to stop him but they found there was no way
He could pick them off from a mountain side a half mile away
Well, they ran him down the border but they never touched his hide
He just slipped across to his hide out on the Colorado side

Old Tom Horn with a rifle by his side
Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

Then one day young Willie Nickle was out a ridin' around
A 44-40 shot rang out and laid the poor boy down
Well, it was only fourteen years since that little kid was born
And they said it looked like the doing's of that lonesome Tom Horn

So the cattlemen went and strung him up
With a length of fresh snipped rope
But his ghost still hangs out in the hills and spooks the Antelope
Now all the rustlers hatred and all the cattlemen's fears
Have kept all Tom Horn alive through all the changing years

Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

Long before you take this cowboys hat

""Now partner this old hat is better left alone
See it used to be my daddy's
But, last year he passed on
My nephew skined the rattler that makes up this ol' hatband

But, back in sixty nine he died in vietnam
Now the eagle feather was given to me by an indian friend of mine
But, someone ran he down somewhere around that Arizona line
And a real special lady gave me this hatpin
And I don't know if I'll ever see her again

""You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry

Long before you take this cowboys hat

""now if your leather jaket means to you what this hat means to me
Then I guess we understand each other and we'll just let it be
But, if you still think it's funny, man you got my back up against the wall
And if you touch my hat you're gonna havta fight us all""

Well right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes
He turned back to the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside
But when my friend turned back towards me
I noticed he's ol' hatbrim
Well it was turned up in a big ol' Texas grin

But since I've met you, girl, there's been a world of change in me
Well, I've got to say I love you, hope you like the sound of that
'Cause I can't keep it under this old hat

Under this old hat is the head you turned around
And the heart you stole away, the day we met
Under this old hat's two arms that long to hold you tight
And the boots I'd walk the soles off of to be here by your side
And every night in my prayers, there's just one thing I ask
That the man you love will always be under this old hat

Well, you've got me feeling things that I've never felt before
And it's so good to know when I come a knocking at your door
That of all the men who'd love to waltz across your welcome mat
The one you want is under this old hat

   Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
   Dance a little closer tonight
   Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
   And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hands
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh but he was back by June, singin' a different tune
And sportin' miss Rita back by is side.  And he sang...

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
Eddie traveled with the barroom bands till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night.  And they sing:

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, hey it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She really made the Woolworth counter shine
Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime...

Chris Leuzinger,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

On that lonesome river bridge

Tryin to get her on the mic for a throat check
Chris poke her first night, that's a sure bet
Got her so wet, on her jeans, full jet
Damn, mami get me stuck
With them tight-ass jeans and she lickin her lips
Shake your ass like you havin a seizure
And girl we gon' freak for a week in the beat so let's go

[Chorus x2]
Let's go, I'm feelin ya flow
Yo' lips and yo' eyes, hips and yo' thighs (let's go)
Let's go, it's Knox and Chris so
We gon' take you on a ride and make it worldwide (let's go)

[Verse Two: Fort Knox]
Knox smoke trees by the ounces
Bumrush the club, I'm bigger than the bouncers (move)
I turn accounts to a trampoline
And my stroke so good it'll cramp a spleen (yeah)
I'm tryin to find me a go-go chick
That can bounce up and down on my pogo stick (bounce)
I'm tellin you girl, your ass is the one
More junk in your trunk than +Sanford & Son+ (oh no!)
And baby girl had a thong made of licorice (okay)
Real ticklish, kiss her on her clitoris
All the chicks wanna check for me
They call me Robo-Knox, I'm a sex machine
And I like 'em real thick like a milkshake (real thick)
With a sick waist, shake it 'til ya hips break
Knox be the same night Knox freak her
Spray white shit on her face like Noczema, let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Chris Lowe]
She got a ass like Gabrielle Union's
I wanna smash, put somethin in the womb and
Shorty face like Vivica Fox
I only hit it one time and I pass it to Knox
Full blast and we chillin with Chuck
And she know she gon' get it if she get in the truck
I like the style, I like your strut
Shake your ass all wild, not givin a fuck

[Verse Four: Fort Knox]
Body right and brain is amazin
Shorty ran more trains than Penn Station
Stay right and keep my pen blazin
My flow's a burnin sensation
So back it up, girl put it in my lap
I take yo' ass home, then you know it's a wrap
Let's get it goin on, yo you know where it's at
I got you, your man ain't gettin you back (let's go)

[Chorus]

",Let's Go,2004
Chris Lowe,"[Chris Lowe]
Shoo-wop shu-wow, bring back the old style
of eighty-three, a part of me y'all don't see
I woke up this mornin and I blessed my life
Blessed the beats, struggled to my strife
Then figured it out, the Lowe don't slack
Lookin in the mirror sayin - damn, glad I'm black
The greatest discovery I once first found
Yeah run it in the ground, punk Lowe so bound
And I don't care what you freestylin about
With money all up in my pockets {niggaz} runnin they mouth
But free {shit} talk {that shit} to me, we gon' see
The big breakdown, {niggaz} is outta gas G
I used to cut the record down to the bone
Now they got me hurtin this microphone
You slipped up once, you slipped up twice
Give up them records and the mic device

[Chorus]
I see rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)

[Chris Lowe]
Too hot to trot, too old to get cold
Blast beats, 'til I got y'all losin control
Chris Lowe, kinda like I'm crackin ya code
At last, blast with a whole lotta soul
It's hot, even though you may think not
Who that scary cat tryin to block my shot?
For what I'm in the cut like I can't come out
to bust down the back door like {?} did shout
Told y'all {niggaz} I'm last to fold y'all
One man street team, the ill street soldier
So bust this like we in it at 6
And snatch off his ice chain with a slick mix
You the best DJ with mad fly tricks
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix

[Chorus]

[Chris Lowe]
Yeah I seen it before, it happened just like this
The legends, be comin back from out the midst
They be hauntin the game, things ain't the same
y'all know the {niggaz} that was real at first, they done changed
over the years, I still got my ears
See the same old re-rocked ideas
Stop, hold up, I'm back in time
My future was yesterday, the best came to play
For y'all the fans, feel free, clap your hands
A {nigga} stand still in a be	-boy stance
And take this here, cause you can play it ten years from now
Rap goin round and round

[Chorus] - 2X",Round & Round,2004
Chris Lowe,"Lights, camera (ACTION!)

Allow me to lace the showcase
The style and the grace on me you gon' see
Gladly, from that introduction, you get the percussion
Blast you fast there go production

Trust, took my top hat off by all means
Lay the funk {shit} down from New Haven to Queens
My stage persona, smooth like {marijuana}
And I'm off the quote, so take you a toke, don't choke

It ain't hard to see me up on the marquee
The next award winning academy nominee
Chris Lowe your bro, legendary type flow fo' sho'
That style right there gon' flow below

Put a slop on top, flip flop hip-hop
Took a nap for three years, woke up still hot
I, slow the roll for the next degree
The brother next to me is the Extra P

[Large Professor]
In top control, when I rock'n'roll
{Niggaz} want to bumrush the dominant soul
Jump start is the reflex art, strong hard and cold
Chris Lowe, make the rhymes explode

In the heat of the night, Large Pro is that excitin sound
Get around with the trey-five pound
Every time the little lady act fake I frown
Shake shake your town, check how I lay it down on the low

Bumrush ya show, like I said once befo'
Large Pro in the house, Chris Lowe
Let it connect, yo Connecticut
Make some noise when I kick it to the girls and boys

That's rough and on the corner, puffin {marijuana}
Ha yeah, gettin paid up front, forever on and beyond
Pass the baton, to my {nigga} and relax
Count stacks, Extra P is a don

[Chorus 2X: Chris Lowe]
Uncut action, pure satisfaction
Wild, bustin out of the frame with the style
Uncut action, pure satisfaction
Wild, bustin out of the frame with the style

[Chris Lowe]
Bust out the frame, blast off top speed
The super soul seeker, funky stoned fiend
'Bout to funk you with this yo split the scene
Your flabbergast ass is lost, that's what I mean

This here gon' be heard from the front to the rear
No doubt, slicked out, for the grand premier
Devestatin to your mind, freakin what you can't hear
Why'all know, Chris Lowe gon' be stuck in your ears

See why'all be seein whassup, peep it out like a fox
Pop it in and out on {niggaz} like a jack in the box
One time, and you don't stop
So get down, to the sound you see

I got the beats that lie, got the beats galo'
Got the beats that you never ever heard before
Now if you say you heard my beats, we gon' have to fight
'Cause I just looped up the funk {shit} last night

[Chorus: x 2]",Uncut Raw,2004
Chris Lowe,"Sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can live your life lonely
Heavy as stone
Live your life learning 
And working alone
Say this is all you want
But I don't believe that it's true
'Cause when you least expect it
Waiting round the corner for you

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

You can live a life of luxury
If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

I know it sounds ridiculous, but speaking from experience
It may seem romantic, and that's no defense
Love will always get to you

Sooner or later, sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world
But where does it get you?

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
(Oooh)

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

I've had enough of scheming and messing around with jerks
My car is parked outside, I'm afraid it doesn't work

Chris Lowe,"Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West end town
Call the police there's a mad man around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West end town

In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls

Faces on posters too many choices

Have you got it do you get it
If so how often
Which do you choose
A hard or soft option

In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls

Ooh a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
We've got no future
We've got no past
Here today built to last
In every city and every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station

I only wanted a job

Got to have it
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
Can't take it

What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

I've been wondering why I'm feeling down

How I'm gonna get through (what have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)

You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh, oh
Now I can do what I want to, forever
How am I gonna get through?

Chris Lowe,"I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone´s wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you´re young you find inspiration
In anyone who´s ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

´Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you´re not careful
You´ll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I´d bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

´Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You´d be sitting somewhere here with me

´Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

´Cause we were never being boring

Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?

Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love, and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love, and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughing stock
Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you, and even in bed
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!
(That's childish, so childish!)

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love, and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

Chris Lowe,"Birthday boy
Can't explain
Christmas Eve
He's born again

On the line
A broken train
Going nowhere
Endless rain

Birthday Boy
So afraid
Plays the machines
In the arcade

Oh baby do you remember
He's been through all this before?
Spent the summer
Getting nowhere
Taking all of the blame
For the city
Calculating
From pain comes pity

Christmas Eve
A time of joy
If you believe
In Birthday Boy

This time around
It's all a mistake
Is he deluded
Or just a fake?

Oh baby do you remember
He's been through all this before?
Spent the summer
Getting nowhere
Taking all of the blame
For the city
Calculating
From pain comes pity

If you knew his name
Would you feel the same?
If you knew his name?

Stands apart
As the drama's
About to start

A quick betrayal
A speedy trial
As before

Of a place we belong
The fire is burning
And the radio's on
Somebody smiles
And it means 'I love you'
But sometimes we don't notice
When the dream has come true

You've got a home here
Call it what you want
You've got a home here
To return to when you can't
Face the world and you need
Some support to succeed
You've got a home

We all make a mess
Of our lives from time to time
It's part of the process
That you stumble as you climb
And if you ever feel
The pain is far too big a deal
I say with pride
I'll be on your side

Sudden plans that don't include you

Without you very well
I get along very well

Now I know you'd much rather be
With rock royalty

I'd been alerted
To your lies
I phoned you up

Took a long time to track you down

And proceeded to deny it

Chris Lowe,"Love is a catastrophe
Look what it's done to me
Brought me down here so low
Stranded, nowhere to go

No concentration
Just rerunning conversation
Trying to understand
How I fell into this quicksand

What happens next?
With life I'm unimpressed
Pain like a cutter's knife
Never been lonelier in my life

Who issued the instruction
For this mad act of destruction?
An end to equilibrium

Look what we've done to him!

Falling November leaves
A weak sun hanging low
Summer seems so long ago

Revealed as so naive

Not as a declaration of war

Couldn't believe my luck was in
I saw him approach
Wearing a most approachable grin

I was surprised he spoke so politely
I said I'd liked his show
Well he just smiled
I guess it happens nightly
And so
I fell in love

We went to his room
He had a video camera
I was so nervous
I had to try hard not to stammer
He said
'I'm glad you liked the show
That crowd was dope out there tonight, alright
You want to see some more?
Well be my guest
You can have a private performance'

I didn't ask why
Though he seemed like such a regular guy
He said we could be
Secret lovers
Just him and me
Then he joked
'Hey, man!
Your name isn't Stan, is it?
We should be together!'
And he was passionate
I guess I would rate
Him a nine out of ten
By then
I'd fallen in love

When I asked
Why have I heard so much
About him being charged
With homophobia and stuff
He just shrugged

Next morning we woke
He couldn't have been a nicer bloke
Over breakfast made jokes
About Dre and his homies and folks

We would see each other again

Yeah, Chris Lowe
(Okay, it's Fort Knox; Chuck Chillout - let's go)

[Verse One: Chris Lowe]
I'm in line to see the club rock
Fly shorties all over lookin too hot
Tryin to get a spot, tryin to see some ass drop
Bend over, let me put it in a padlock
Backwards, full of hydro
In New York, or New Haven, or Chicago
Oh yeah, by the way, my name Chris Lowe
Move ya hips lows, love it when ya lips blow
Damn - shorty's standin by the coat check
Tryin to get her on the mic for a throat check
Chris poke her first night, that's a sure bet
Got her so wet, on her jeans, full jet
Damn, mami get me stuck
With them tight-ass jeans and she lickin her lips
Shake your ass like you havin a seizure
And girl we gon' freak for a week in the beat so let's go

[Chorus x2]
Let's go, I'm feelin ya flow
Yo' lips and yo' eyes, hips and yo' thighs (let's go)
Let's go, it's Knox and Chris so
We gon' take you on a ride and make it worldwide (let's go)

[Verse Two: Fort Knox]
Knox smoke trees by the ounces
Bumrush the club, I'm bigger than the bouncers (move)
I turn accounts to a trampoline
And my stroke so good it'll cramp a spleen (yeah)
I'm tryin to find me a go-go chick
That can bounce up and down on my pogo stick (bounce)
I'm tellin you girl, your ass is the one
More junk in your trunk than +Sanford & Son+ (oh no!)
And baby girl had a thong made of licorice (okay)
Real ticklish, kiss her on her clitoris
All the chicks wanna check for me
They call me Robo-Knox, I'm a sex machine
And I like 'em real thick like a milkshake (real thick)
With a sick waist, shake it 'til ya hips break
Knox be the same night Knox freak her
Spray white shit on her face like Noczema, let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Chris Lowe]
She got a ass like Gabrielle Union's
I wanna smash, put somethin in the womb and
Shorty face like Vivica Fox
I only hit it one time and I pass it to Knox
Full blast and we chillin with Chuck
And she know she gon' get it if she get in the truck
I like the style, I like your strut
Shake your ass all wild, not givin a fuck

[Verse Four: Fort Knox]
Body right and brain is amazin
Shorty ran more trains than Penn Station
Stay right and keep my pen blazin
My flow's a burnin sensation
So back it up, girl put it in my lap
I take yo' ass home, then you know it's a wrap
Let's get it goin on, yo you know where it's at
I got you, your man ain't gettin you back (let's go)

Allow me to lace the showcase
The style and the grace on me you gon' see
Gladly, from that introduction, you get the percussion
Blast you fast there go production

Trust, took my top hat off by all means
Lay the funk {shit} down from New Haven to Queens
My stage persona, smooth like {marijuana}
And I'm off the quote, so take you a toke, don't choke

It ain't hard to see me up on the marquee
The next award winning academy nominee
Chris Lowe your bro, legendary type flow fo' sho'
That style right there gon' flow below

Put a slop on top, flip flop hip-hop
Took a nap for three years, woke up still hot
I, slow the roll for the next degree
The brother next to me is the Extra P

[Large Professor]
In top control, when I rock'n'roll
{Niggaz} want to bumrush the dominant soul
Jump start is the reflex art, strong hard and cold
Chris Lowe, make the rhymes explode

In the heat of the night, Large Pro is that excitin sound
Get around with the trey-five pound
Every time the little lady act fake I frown
Shake shake your town, check how I lay it down on the low

Bumrush ya show, like I said once befo'
Large Pro in the house, Chris Lowe
Let it connect, yo Connecticut
Make some noise when I kick it to the girls and boys

That's rough and on the corner, puffin {marijuana}

Bust out the frame, blast off top speed
The super soul seeker, funky stoned fiend
'Bout to funk you with this yo split the scene
Your flabbergast ass is lost, that's what I mean

This here gon' be heard from the front to the rear
No doubt, slicked out, for the grand premier
Devestatin to your mind, freakin what you can't hear
Why'all know, Chris Lowe gon' be stuck in your ears

See why'all be seein whassup, peep it out like a fox
Pop it in and out on {niggaz} like a jack in the box
One time, and you don't stop
So get down, to the sound you see

I got the beats that lie, got the beats galo'
Got the beats that you never ever heard before
Now if you say you heard my beats, we gon' have to fight
'Cause I just looped up the funk {shit} last night

Chris Lowe,"Why did I listen to that music?
It’s made me feel so sad
And brought it home to me once more

When you can’t get what you want
You still have all the rest
But isn’t it sad to settle for second-best?

I’ve been waiting at home
For someone to phone

Without living that old cliche
I’ve been lying in bed
The sheets over my head
I didn’t get where I am today
Without giving up in dismay

Told everyone I’m over it
I’ve quit this cul-de-sac
But just when I thought
I’d lost it for good
That feeling comes right back
When you can’t get what you want
You wear your bravest face
But deep inside you’re sinking without a trace

I’ve been called repressed
A poet, a pest
I didn’t get where I am today
Without getting in someone’s way
I live my life on a stage
Put it down on the page
I didn’t get where I am today
Without writing a resume
I didn’t get where I am today

I didn’t get where I am today
I didn’t get where I am today

I’ve explored situations
The themes and variations
I didn’t get where I am today
Without losing it on the way

Looking for someone to blame

Chris Lowe,"Somewhere out in the heart of Suburbia
Flinching from the words
That could almost murder her
Listen, it's the final day

Whatever boys say
Girls don't cry
Whatever boys say
Girls don't cry

She's wearin' plaid and jeans
Like a workman on the road
Hitchin' out west
With a personal stereo
Playin' ""Lay, lady, lay""

Whatever boys say
Girls don't cry
Whatever boys say
Girls don't cry

In her heart she's not even a renegade
From the start she knew
Why she would not be saved
All her instincts lead a different way

In the pocket by her heart
Is a dog-eared Polaroid
A picture of a girl with her arm 'round a boy
Who went missing the final day

Girls don't cry

I'm all alone again, I'm all alone
I'm all alone again, I'm all alone

I walked into the room
Imagine my surprise
You were sitting close to him
Staring in each other's eyes

Each of you looked up
But no one said a word
I felt, I should apologize
For what I hadn't heard

A silence filled the room
Awkward as an elephant
In the crowded court of your love
I was now a supplicant

And clumsy as I felt
At stumbling on this theft
To save further embarrassment
I made my excuses and left

So long ago
I felt like such a fool, for crying
All that I know
It is when you feel inside, you're dying

It all begins again
Defying, your excuses

Chris Lowe,"Oh, I learned a lesson
From the twentieth century
That I don't think we can just dismiss
After one hundred years
Of inhumanity
The lesson that I learned was this:

Sometimes the solution
Is worse than the problem
Let's stay together

Well I bought a ticket
To the revolution
And I cheered when the statues fell
Everyone came
To destroy what was rotten
But they killed off what was good as well

Sometimes the solution
Is worse than the problem
Let's stay together

Stay with me
This century
Together we're better

Oh, I learned a lesson
From the twentieth century
It may seem somewhat hit or miss
If you've certainty
'Bout the way it's all meant to be
The lesson that you need is this:

Sometimes the solution
Is worse than the problem
Let's stay together",Twentieth Century,2006

But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
One minute I held the key, next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castle stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand.

Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field.

It was the wicked and wild wind, blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string, oh who would ever want to be king?

Just separates them now - She still loves him

30 odd years been 'bout havin' my cake up
So I'm 'bout my paper, 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here, since we gotta be here
Life is but a beach chair (chair, chair chair)
Went from havin' shabby clothes to crossin' over Abbey Road
Hear my angel singin' to me (Are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearin' right, karma's got me fearin' like
Kalik are you prayin' for me? (for me)
See I got demons in my past so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct that the child shall have to pay
For the sins of her father so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays and hope that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I give up my share of Carol's daughter and a new beach chair

(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna go, wake up
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave

Life is but a dream to me, gunshots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin', I'm afraid of not tryin'
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no I never been on MySpace
Too busy lettin' my voice vibrate
Carvin' out my space, in this world of fly girls
Cutthroats and diamond cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope and one's grind
Son said ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said ""from not bein' afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul'll find and even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair (chair, chair)

[Chorus]

Life is but a dream, can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice in a cut, the winner's cup
Well winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes wit' this life, just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you
Chica, the corazon is what brought us home
The great shape like Heidi Klum mighty gone, I am on 
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes so you won't lose scent
I make it stink for you think I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of two cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

While he naps the day away
She tends the cubs and helps them play
You have to wonder where's his sense of pride
While he is shiny teeth and thrown
She takes care of things back home

Chris Martin,"Where is my boy?
I saw you come out of a scene
Maybe in some kind of dream
Something that never comes. 

Time that I take
See over in arms I raise
All racing to find you
All racing to find you. 

Time stands
I open your house to my world
I see you come out of it all
Unharmed and unscathed and shouting. 

Come over here
And the houses i live in
And changes you're making
To the state of affairs. 

Calling where is my boy?
I have seen you so often
I cry where is my boy
Or have you all forgotten?

And in some kind of dream
Have I seen you before?
Have I seen you before?
Where is my boy? 

So come all the waves
Changing your number
Changing the house where you live
Change your lines. 

Have I seen you before
In some kind of a dream?
In a place you've forgotten
A place I've forgotten. 

So where is my boy?
Have I seen you before in some kind of a dream?
Have I seen you before?
Where is my boy?

I say where was my head when i needed it most?
Oh I stayed here before
Yes I'll stay in the place I know.",Where Is My Boy?,2002
Chris Martin,"I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
And then away I crawl

And away I crawl
And away I crawl
And away I crawl","Your Love Means Everything, Pt. 2",2002
Chris Martin,"Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
30 odd years been 'bout havin' my cake up
So I'm 'bout my paper, 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here, since we gotta be here
Life is but a beach chair (chair, chair chair)
Went from havin' shabby clothes to crossin' over Abbey Road
Hear my angel singin' to me (Are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearin' right, karma's got me fearin' like
Kalik are you prayin' for me? (for me)
See I got demons in my past so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct that the child shall have to pay
For the sins of her father so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays and hope that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I give up my share of Carol's daughter and a new beach chair

[Chorus]
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna go, wake up
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna go, wake up
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave

Life is but a dream to me, gunshots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin', I'm afraid of not tryin'
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no I never been on MySpace
Too busy lettin' my voice vibrate
Carvin' out my space, in this world of fly girls
Cutthroats and diamond cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope and one's grind
Son said ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said ""from not bein' afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul'll find and even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair (chair, chair)

[Chorus]

Life is but a dream, can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice in a cut, the winner's cup
Well winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes wit' this life, just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you
Chica, the corazon is what brought us home
The great shape like Heidi Klum mighty gone, I am on 
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes so you won't lose scent
I make it stink for you think I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of two cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

[Chorus: x2]

I hear my angels sing",Beach Chair,2006

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

As the cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world

Whilst on all fours

What's wrong with this picture?

Farewell the ashtray girl

Beware this troubled world
Watch out for earthquakes
Goodbye to open sores
To broken center floor

For fear of growing old

Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

Oh they flicker and they float

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets that I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
""Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Like you hit one of them in the balls and stuff like that 
Most times they’ll stop chasing you after a while when they can’t catch you 
But cops don’t do that and, and, and I found out the hard way 
But, but they proceeded to tell an old lady to go back inside 
And right when they were fixing to go through the door 
They pulled the drummer down and slammed him on the ground 
Slammed him, slammed him

Needless to say the crowd went a little  crazy 
And so did the cops, they were in a frenzy 
They came in and started macing everybody 
About that time, macing 
Bombing, macing, whatever you need to bug…you the bugs all night, your house 
So he comes through, one cop comes through
Bumps me on the back 
Without even thinking 
In my primal rage stage I was inebriated with alcohol, 
That is it, that is it 
And young, young vitality, vitality 
And I don’t even think, and I grab the cop from behind
And he, and he and I was like what are you doing man? 
And he turns around and proceeds to mace me right in my face 
Not even a foot, away from my face 
So I stop thinking, I just take off running 
I was actually high-stepping, it was like 
My buddy said he saw me, and I was like he saw some 
Long legged creature just like 
He took a base high stepping 
Going down sixth street, stop tinkling 
So I stopped and turned around

Like you hit one of them in the balls and stuff like that

But cops don’t do that, and, and, and I found out the hard way 
Because they caught me, because they caught me 
Because they caught me, because they caught me 
When he's high-steppin'  I can’t catch that

And tonight I know it all has to begin again

Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble

Just erodes us in the rain 
Just erodes us and see roses

Some people quietly reveal
In the manner of the meek
Some people shout the way they feel
To a radical degree
Some people sing it to express
While others hear another call
Some people speak with subtleness
Some don't rely on words at all
But let me tell you 'bout

[Chorus]

One thing I know
Everybody's got a seed to sow
let your heart of hearts
Take you down the road
Everybody's got a seed to sow

We all are pieces of the whole
With different feelings to evoke
Giving distinction to the role
Different players-different strokes
But let me tell you 'bout

Some people race
Some people vary in their pace
But God can use what you can give

Everybody loves a small town
Why you gotta hate your hometown?
Them folks brought you up
But all you ever do is put them down

Everybody knows the city's no good for you
Look at your face
Look at what it's done to you
How long do you think a pretty thing like you can last
Sleeping in a sewer
Beneath a skyscraper casket?

I want to walk down Vandalia Avenue
Holding hands
Just like we used to do
You say you hate the weak women and the ignorant men
But what's a little nigger joke between friends?

Do you hate their aching backs
Or the blisters on their hands?
Do you hate the way they beat you when you didn't fit in?
Do you hate their empty faces
Or do you hate the weather?
They probably wouldn't stare if you just dressed a little better",All You Ever Do,2000

I know you're looking for me
But I won't let myself be found

Every time I see your face
I can feel my heart break
I know it's just a little bit
But I don't know how much more of it
I can take

All my friends are hanging out
Down at the borderline
And I'd like to talk about it
But I just don't have the time
They all say you're looking for me
But there's not that much left to find

Every time I see your face
I can hear my heart break
I know it's just a little sound
But there's not that much to move around here
Anyway

Every time I see your face
I can hear my heart break
I know it's just a little sound
But in my head it seems so loud
And every time you pass me by
I don't know if I'm going to live or die
Because you're the only thing I've ever loved

Throw the curtains wide
Wipe you from my eyes

Because I've been waiting
Such a long, long time
And the truth isn't helping
So I guess I'll just pay it no mind
I've made up my mind
It's gonna be a brand new day

The sun comes creeping in
Gonna get burned again
I'm still fucking up
And those suckers are cashing in

Chris Mills,"All the junkies in Kentucky
Could not write you out of this one
Sinner, even God could not save you now
For it is your own finger
That is poised upon the trigger
That is connected to the barrel in your mouth
It seems you are the architect of your heart's destruction
It was your own eye that plotted this direction
Bridges you have burned
Down blind alleys you have turned
But there seems to be no artist left who would paint your resurrection

Are you falling?
Do you need me somehow?
All those things you said you'd never do
Come so easily to you now
Well, are you falling?
Did gravity let you down?
Are you crying 'cause there's no one
There to catch you now?

I don't think you understand the trouble you got yourself in
Does it hurt more to be under attack
Or to fall from the back of someone who called you friend?
You got another thing coming
If you think you're coming this way again
All them you had under your feet
Gonna put you up against the wall in the end

Now all the angels and the strangers
Who once were so kind to you
Cannot be seen and are nowhere to be found
And all those golden-throated shadows
Who for so long came stumbling through you
Have pulled the pennies from your pockets
And left them filled with doubt

And now you're falling
The bottom's dropping out
What good does all your screaming do
If nobody can hear a sound?
Now that you're falling
Everybody knows who sold you out
And now you're crying 'cause there's no one
There to catch you now",Fall,2000

In your filthy mouth
I want to touch your face

In your greasy hair
I know I've got a bad eye
But you're the one who put it there

Kiss me
Your lips are like poison
All the boys in the park
Are waiting their turn
To die in your arms with no lessons learned

You've got a weak heart
And a beat-up car
You've got stretch marks
From reaching too far
Your good luck charms
Have all run out of luck

You say you don't use it anymore
But I can hear it beating through the walls
It's shaped like a fist
But fighting is not what it's for

I've been stealing your breath
And you've been watching me fade
And I'm beginning to suspect
Dreaming at all
Was our very first mistake

I don't mind drinking myself to sleep
As long as I'm sleeping in your arms
I've been pulling out my teeth
Now you're the only one who can do us any harm

And a tear-stained pillow
A good friend
And a diamond ring

These are things I remember
But they are starting to fade
I have changed the locks 
On my heart since you were here 
And now that key you've got 
Will only unlock a box of tears 

But I wish I'd saved a copy for myself 
Because now there are places in my heart 
I will never go again
A letter never written

And a message
Too late received

Chris Mills,"I heard you're a drunk
And you never shut up
The word on the street
Is that your sweet ass
Is totally fucked

And I know you don't sleep
Because you're too scared to dream
Or maybe it's just that waking up
Is harder than it seems

But if I loved you hard enough
Could you shake off that black coal dust
And shine for me?
Come on, diamond
Shine for me

Yeah, if I loved you hard enough
Could you shake off that black coal dust
And shine like a diamond?
Shine like gold
Instead of sucking those cigarettes
Through that hole in your throat

Prisoner of the perfume that you wear
I'm not trying to say
You're not where it's at for me
I'm just getting a little scared

Tangled in the sheets of your bed
Bending underneath your heavy head
I should learn not to ask
But your mouth, it tastes like broken glass
And how long is seven years from today?

All I ever wanted was somebody to love
At least that's what I used to say
But be careful of the wishes
That crawl across your lips
You may choke on them someday

Trying to be as quiet as a mouse
Waiting for your lungs to run out
Do you remember when
You said you'd never cry again?

Gonna take the A train
I wanna take it downtown

For your broken heart
It's time to start dreaming again

And this is a last goodbye
To everything that made you cry
This is a time of reckoning
And I reckon

If you're scared to close your eyes
You can whisper this lullaby
And feel my breath upon your ear

And maybe you'll fall asleep
To the rhythm of your lover's heartbeat
Even when I'm miles away from here

This is a requiem
For everything you've ever been
That you never really wanted to be

But this is a slight return
To sad goodbyes and lessons learned

I shiver as it shimmers
I shudder as it shines

And there is telepathy
Between lovers' hearts and all ships at sea
Don't you know that I know what you're thinking?
Lover, once we were living the dream
Where I'd drown in you and you'd drown in me
But now it seems I'm the only one who's sinking

Because you've got oceans in your eyes
And your hips control the tides
But you've been poisoned by the promise
Of another lover's lies

That connects your heart to mine
And I pray that it will always
Bring you back to me in time",The Silver Line,2002
