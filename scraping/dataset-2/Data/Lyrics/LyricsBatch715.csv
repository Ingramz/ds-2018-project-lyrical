Metallica,"You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey, iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey, iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey, iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey, ah ah ah iced honey
Iced honey, iced honey
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey, iced honey
Oh iced honey
See if the 
See if the ice will melt for you

Metallica,"I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain

You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh

I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else

I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss

Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away

Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat

I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl

You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me

But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg

You are my Goliath
You are my Goliath
And I am mistress dread

Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head

Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away

All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away",Mistress Dread,2011

Pumping blood
Pumping your blood
Pumping blood

Pumping blood

Pumping blood

If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass

And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
Come on James!

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, ""mercy""
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation
""Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you""
""Oh Jack I beseech you""
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
""Oh Jack, Jack I beseech""
""Jack, I beseech you, I beseech""
In the end it was an ordinary heart
""Oh Jack I beseech you""
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart
""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you""
Supreme violation oh
""Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you""
I call out your name

Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen

I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in

Niggas try to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation, shifty
Creepin' niggas in the dark, triggas with no heart
Rippin' ass apart, I'll be swimmin' with the sharks now
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter
Kid, you oughta start reachin' for that nickle-plated auto-

Method Man,"Basically, can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
Records hey  so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf I stick 'em for the cream
Check it  just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Color clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and coming for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pulling niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

And when I was a lil' stereo (Stereo)
I listened to some champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
Will now I be the number one (Tical hahaha)
Now you listen to the Gargon (Gargon)
And the Gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (Test me)
Me gwanna lick out them brains (It's like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
The only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
Off the set comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin' through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Let me know it's real son, if it's really real

Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing, hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it dick up in you fuck ya

Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching, and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA, to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryin to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies
At a whack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, killa hill projects
How to be exact, break it down

Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

Who come to get you
None, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies",Wu-Gambinos,1995

With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what? 
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin 
Straight from the beginning, of the game

I want action, that's what I need
I never put doubt in my mind
'Cause I know when I touch the mic there's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be large
Tired of sittin' on my fuckin' ass
Niggas I know, be runnin' around with mad fuckin' cash
Who the fuck wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy I'm on welfare

Move 'em out move 'em out
Stick it up raw hide

Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin' niggas who said they got stacks, 'cause I don't give a fuck
I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin' your fuckin' face, some blood
I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind
Every time I get around devils
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin'
'Cause I'm comin', I'm dope like fuckin' heroin
Wu-tang bloodkin', a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin 'shot up with ol dirty insulin
You bound to catch aids or somethin'
Not sayin' I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it
What

Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now eat my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-tang, is bangin' like a ron g tape
Rza pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it john gotti
Collidin' on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up feel the blast from the silencer

Move 'em in move 'em in
Move 'em out move 'em out
Stick it up raw hide

Comin' soon to a theatre near you it be the wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?

I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture

The Egyptian Musk use to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop till I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the darkside tears you into hollywood squares
6 million ways to die, so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the rap
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
And yo my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches use to play me now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check glock
Empty off a licking off a hip hop
Fuck the billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your billboard spot?

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the funk doctor spock smoking Buddha on a train

How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize, Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So High that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So Sick that you can suck my dick

Blow canals of Panama
Just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with, or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes, I love those Section A Bit-ches
Hitting switches, Twisting wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga,
Boo, scared you, blew you to smithe-reens
Fuck the marines, I got machines
To light the spliff, and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya 5 times like US AIR off an instrumental
Look I'm not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks

In the basement music just right

Of Mr. DJ's turntable's goin' round
A mad sensation, a crew of women around sparks inspiration
To set something off the right way to hear the people say

Method Man,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place

Of the Mobb killing, is like an Unsolved Mystery 
Puzzling, nobody knows, it's all history 

Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get lovely 
Never fails it's always something 
No rest, daily gotta rock my vest 
I shoot at your best man yeah your MVP 
He played the front line got struck down immediately 
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps when 

Heavy load my military hold ammunition 
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not 
My crew, changing New York, who taking your spot 
I put the green light on, your whole click, island shit 
Running through the hoe-house wilding, extorting 
(Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up) 

Extortion is the key I got the key for extortion 
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion 
Take precaution, infamous laws enforced in 
You married to the mobb, kid take it then divorce it 
'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes 
If you scared get a dog don't got a click then recruit 

You're weak troop, lost the tan in the mist 
On your name my shit, take it like a man you little bitch 
I blaze yo britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin 
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter 
This Shaolin representer, carry thirty-six deadly shits 
You fuckin with, top contenders 

Official to the bone gristle 
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols 
Remember me, burn a nigga to a third degree 
Don't act familiar motherfuckers you ain't heard of me 
Just peep the stee and the rap how it's supposed to be 
Tap the pockets bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin 

On top of that we hip-hoppin, and don't stoppin 
Out-of-state drawers-droppin, the panty-raiders 
Slide on ya like gators, umped that stank bitch back out 
And then played her, but that ain't nothin 
Crossin this dog walkin, native New York and 
Shaolin slang talkin, rap nigga 

Mr. Freeze crowd shiver 
What? Young, black, and don't give a fuck 
If the next crew get the scissor
(Extortion, extortion, give that up kid, extortion) 

Bottom line, what the fuck you want to do 
You eyein me, at the same time I'm eyein you, punk 
Want to pop the most junk 
Be the same motherfucker with the most lumps 
Chew on that shit punk faggot (word up) 
Burn his ass like a book of matches

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

[Verse One: RZA]
Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this b**** advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Bla** and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Biere denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket he gripped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy started haveta brown skin derby
Master Tommy Hil Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cap and fleece wear
One wear plaids the Don will hold the best for all wear
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on

Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Fotomat
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin

Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?
The whole shit's like wrestling
What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexin

This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned
Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs with aimless slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!

Method Man,"Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic, what we be smokin, Tical
The resevoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Hold ground by yo' side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton, blowin her back out like Bob Backlund
I'm throwin wrestlin holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life

I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get, caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time

It's that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter

Word

Just do what ya feel and never follow (repeat 3X)
Funk Doc break it down

Hah, yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze yo' camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shunt your million dollar investment, to economy
Impossibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin ""Caution when wet by the track wetter""
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga [chik-chik BLAAAOW] and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come close if I gave you my bookin agent
Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up - you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and yo' editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung (one me gun done)
Get on the mic and break em off with sumthin sumthin

We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sho' shots, it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
U-A-P ain't got no weapon, you lip professin
Next in, line, parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin, too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack
Show them wack niggas where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch

We have now taken over your radio

Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't want to move then I'm comin' right through you

It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who want to tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)

Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc the monstar funk

Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (uhh)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness (uhhh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money
Or in it for the love, M.J.
Twenty- three ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (uhh)
I'm twenty-eight light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like bob dole
Am I gettin' lyrical
Daddy, I think so

And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Yo, god bless
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' why'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be
They be the monsters

But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

In my mind I'm rippin' your clothes
Playing with your feet, girl, suckin' your toes
Go 'round with the Ghetto Sarano', mellow
Romeo, who like his women on the same level
Pay my bills that were due; all accounts settled
Now I'm relaxing like Pa, now with Ma Kettle
Baby laughing, earrings in both nipples

Throw them panties over there, you won't need those
You talk like sex
You walk like sex
Ya smell like sex
Ya yell like sex
And all ya want is Mr. Meth, hell of a man
That can sell an Eskimo a fan
I come equipped for any spot that you want hit
Or want licked; when my dick get the fuck outta here, ah, shit
I start to think back on how I go hump
In seven minutes to heaven at the age of eleven
Couldn't tell me nuthin' then, can't tell me nuthin' now
Honey child, milkin' the cow, lovin' my style
This is what we do, kid - me and them Dru kids

You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home

Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is

Iz you wit me, yo throw your hands in the air!

No matter what you do baby, stack your gunz 'n onez 

Yo, light another, and elevate on this one my brother 
Respect mine like my baby mother 
I shine when it rain, the sky's cryin' for all the black youth 
That's dyin', I heard he went out clutchin' his iron 
And in the mist the slugs flyin', one burst 
He kissed the dirt, not knowin' he was touched at first 
Or badly hurt, it's all science, another nigga merked 
Kid snatched his purse and his work, left nuttin' 
But the shells on the turf, the situation's worse 
A lot of bitch ass niggaz is comin' out they skirts 
Cause it's real, not everyone can rhyme and get a deal 
Not everyone can shine and make a meal 
So Johnny carry nine in the steel, one in the head 
For all them fuckheads, leave that ass for dead nuff said 
Don't be mistaken, or mislead, it's all peace 
But when my baby's gotta get fed, I'm all teeth

Slap a hoe and then grab a hoe just like ? ?

Then deep down in they heart, they think that nigga Ruck is crazy 
Maybe, y'all niggaz should just chill before I fuck you up

So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collabora-tion

[Chorus:]

Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs

[Verse One: True Master]

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter

[Verse Two: Method Man]

Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Prodigal Sunn]

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth
I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mindstate
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?

[Verse Four: Hell Razah]

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
? of Islam, keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
? , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

[Chorus]

[Johnny Blaze]
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, men from the Sun

The best way you can hope to get close to me

I Shaolin strut through the city asphalt, fed up
Hold ya head up, I'm circlin the block, keep ya eyes up
Wise up before you get sized up (tied up)
Play no game, speakin on my name you catch a clip full
From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change

Punch the data in ya mainframe

Hey yo listen! 
I'm only lettin' five of you motherfuckers in here tonight 
If your man ain't on the guest list 
He get to the BACJ of the fuckin' line 
And you know another motherfuckin' thing? 
I don't give a fuck if a bitch spill a drink 
in this motherfucker tonight 
I'm kickin' all y'all the fuck outta here 

Uh, muh'fuckers be up in the club scared to fuckin' death 
Nigga if you scared why don't yo' ass just stay the fuck home 
Check it out, uh, me and mines at the door, ain't tryin to pay your fees 
Stop playin, you fuckin' with me, I push my way in 
Bum rush there's plenty of us to tear the club up 
Guzzlin' Bacardi and such, I split a Dutch 
Bouncin' nigga lookin' like he want war 
Now I ain't the one you got to front Pah 
Pattin me down like the law, as I stumble in the party 
Topsey off the Limon Bacardi for sure 
Loungin' near the bar section, rolled the L 
And kept steppin', concealed weapon, razor sharp 
Blue star hatchet, in the sleeve of my jacket 
Who that kid, on the dance floor lookin' for matches? 
Burn somethin', one toke got me blasted 
Took another toke then I passed it, choke! 
Fantastic, herb ain't no joke 
Especially that into smoke mixed with hashish 
Ladies on the dance floor, shakin' they asses 
Got million dollar broke niggaz, that makin' passes 
Honey with the eye glasses, body work is Boombastic 
Skin like blackberry molasses, mm 
At last it's, time to step and make her mine 
Niggaz headin' toward the bathroom tuckin' they shines 
Brothers got to keep it movin', playin with kids 
That won't hesitate to snatch a Cuban 
You know what this is
(""Yo Duke that's your diamonds right there God? 
Yo that shit'll go right where my people ain't right now"" 
""Yo don't touch my shit!"") 
Now it's on in the lavatory, I heard a scream 
End of story couldn't find shorty, party scene's 
Now a fucked up chaotic thing, won't be long 
Before the sirens intervene, the territory 
Can't we all get along, without the ruckus 
Got big bouncin' muh'fuckers, tryin to rush us 
I can take a hint, what? Can smell the stench 
Of a hell bent environment, the odds against us 
Back to the wall y'all, refuse to fall 
All hands on deck yes, prepare to brawl 
Uh, every time I try to have a good time why? 
Somebody always fuckin' it up, killin' my high, damn 
Monkey wrench they whole program, party over 
By that time I'm dead sober 
In the midst of this whole shit fo' soldiers, dead gone 
You can tell that they was heat holders 
Everybody hit the deck when they expose tech, I fled the set 
Bitch slipped and caught a broke neck, some Brooklyn kids 
Rushed the coat check, they whole set, stompin' Duke 
Half to death and took his Rolex, it's horrible 
Like a front page article, Mister Pitiful 
About a step away now we critical, uh 
As I boned out I heard the people shout

Method Man,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

Let them toes get they tag on, dead men run no marathons 

On my shift, shootin that gift, knowin he snitched 

On the telethon, runnin his lips, sinkin the ship 

Give back what his mother gave him, mother made him 

And now she can't even save him, Johnny Blaze 'em 

Send him to his final restin

Motherfuckin torture, y'all niggaz know

Torture chambers where John Doe's remain nameless, hear me? 

I know it's Def Jam, but think clearly 

I made it possible for y'all cats to come near me 

Keep your enemies, close and your heat closer 

I slam just like my culture on all theories 

Dead that - straight off the meat rack with this one 

You get burned playin Nix-on, Hot Biscuit 

Stand back - don't make me spit one, and paint pictures 

On the walls of your mental, with hot lead from out these pencils 

Iron Lung since I was young and not knowin 

Where the next meal was comin from, been troublesome 

To all those posin a threat 

If I go, everybody gotta go next, y'all niggaz know

And time watchin me colder, Grim Reaper 

Breathin death on my shoulder 

Waitin for the day to take me over (take me over) 

Torture (3X) 

Motherfuckin torture, y'all niggaz know

Still tryin to fuck my hoe, Johnny-come-latelys? 

Got me in a world of shit, and now I'm pissed 

Mama said there'd be days like this, tis the SeaZon 

For Ducks and my pen's bleedin 

Leavin' kids barely breathin for sneak-thievin 

Famished from lack of eatin and lack of teachin 

Banished from Rhyme & Reason for high treason, can it be 

That the kid with the knot knees 

Got G to make a grown man cop pleas, for this track 

I got a Lovebug like Starsky, blow back 

Until I drop Tical Part 3, ain't no stoppin 

When you start me, John Jay 

Pullin your card, mayday mayday 

Niggaz owe they life to God, and now it's payday 

Take it how ya want to take it, fully clothed or butt-naked 

I learned the hard way - ain't nuttin sacred 

In this world - time to face it, Johnny Basic 

Instinct, I'm sure to make it 

While others fake it, fuck the spotlight, G-O-D already got light 

Say what you like, just spell my name right

With Big Mike and Scarface and Luke loop 
Me and lil' Crook like Bo and Luke duke 
When I'm in Miama I go to scoop Luke 
To see the peep show and hit the duke shoot 
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex coup 
Up in ""Harlem World"" in my Timb boots 
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot 
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof 
Seen T-Funk he took is to the fruit 
Then he went to the Tunnell and brought down the roof 
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin sweat 
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex 
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tape decks 
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex 
S.D., Jersey we getting more sex 
Flow next 
Go next

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh 

If my niggas can't eat then y'all niggaz can't sleep 
I just begun to peep Nightmare on Elm Street 
Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capeesh? 
Kickin dust as I bust,  peace 
And all them crooked cops on the beat 
My niggas bring the funk like your Grandpa feet 
Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts 
With darts, like HBO watching after dark 
No love for a mark, even less for a trick 
That want to be like Mike, Mike who my 
Real shit hotness 
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit 
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit 
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it 
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket 
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic 
Leave the crop scene spotless 
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic 
Niggas, synchronize your watches 
We're goin in, wit nothing but a clan logo 
Mr. meth, (DMX!) 
I'm running loco 
Motherfucker

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood 
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh 

I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo 
Feel the pressure 
Snatching niggas up just like a chain off the dresser 
Niggas hit me with the best shit then what 
I shake that bullshit off then go 
I've been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing 
Y'all niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something 
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say 
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day 
The best way you can hope to get close to me 
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be 
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange 
Best to be ducking range 
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain 
I break niggaz like promises 
Split em' open like Thomas' 
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist 
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime 
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time

Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept
I disconnect the phones and the rest
Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the livin dead, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this Earth
Ever hear of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone

Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs

Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here

Niggas scream out, it's just us bitches
Don't shoot, out the phone booth
I aim at your party, hit the wrong group
Happy birth ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Ducking brick walls get thumbtacked
So run laps,'fore I body you

No one, would fold both thumbs
And eight fingers, to square with Joe Young
Tongue below one, spit dumb, moron
For whiteboys to snowboard on
So What 'Cha What 'Cha What 'Cha Want
Chew Spearmint gum, two double pump
Two cannons, piece by piece

Mule on his ass, take the blast out Binaca
For real doe, Arsenic Production that kill slow

Straight beef without french fries and a Coke

The ""Lethal 5"" from Riggs and Murtaugh

OD on Flinstone chewables and mary mary mary
So dont ever say I didn't warn ya
And I dont wanna be the one to sik the dogs on ya
I'm still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my peoples ghetto

Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East Coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin' in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin

Well damn, how the hell you think we livin?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People want to know why I ain't on my brother's label

If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck

Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards

You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust

The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our Way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground 'til we under ground
But y'all first motherfuckers

My thugs, throw up ya set
And shorties rub on ya breasts
Get the fuck up, outta that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talent tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like Big, you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet into delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay stickin' fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, shoulda insured that link
Straight to Canal I'll praise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up

Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, been thuggin'
Lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush we take over
Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fuckin' fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin' out and you know who's showin' it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about the souls on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin' this money like Leonardo (Do-Do-Do-Do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin' area
Wildin' in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you nigga you better get the fuck up!",Simon Says [Remix],1999

Hey you, look nigga, one more strike you through

Yo I believe that's me
Yo, get on the mic and rock the symphony

[Erick Sermon]
Yo p!
Time to rock, the sound I got, it reigns hot
Making necks snap back, like a slingshot
E hustle, and muscle my way in
Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazing
Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it
Then leave them like, who done it?
Sucker duck, I do what I feel right now
When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, ""wow!""
Yo! I get looks when I'm in the place
That's that nigga, making you +smile+ with Scarface
It ain't my fault, that my style silk enough to shock ya

Yo yo
Did you ever think you would catch a cap?
Yo did you ever think you would get a slap?
Yo did you ever think you would get robbed
At gunpoint, stripped and thrown out the car?
It's funk doc, you know my name hoe
My style dirty underground, or Ukraine po'
When it hits you, pain pumps cool-aid, through the vein and shit
Snatch the trap then I dash like Damon did
Doc, walk thin red lines to shell shock
Hair lock with fucking broads in nail shops
Hydro? got more bags than bellhops
Two thousand Benz on my eight by ten picture
Papichu', slaying gcrews in icu
Battling, using hockey rules
For Keith Murray, doc gon' cock these tools
Rollin down like dice in Yahtzee fool!
I ""just do it"" like Nike, outta 'bama
With ten kids with hammers, hooked to a camper!

It's the g-o-d
Yo yo, get on the mic for the symphony

Youth on the move, paying them dues, nothing to lose
Huh, street kids, broken and bruised, eyeing yo' jewels
Huh, bad news, baring they souls through rhyming blues
Hardcore! to make them brothers act fool
Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel 
Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill 
Feeling like the mack inside a Cadillac Seville 
Too ill, on cuts, the barber of Seville, fi-ga-ro!
The sky is falling, Geronimo!
I feel my high coming down, lookout below!
Hey yo! dead that roach clip and spark another
Chicken hawks, playing they selves like Parker brothers
I rock for the low-class, from locash
The broke-assed, even rock for trailer park trash
Yeah yeah, the god on your block like Godzilla
Yeah yeah, she gave away my pussy I'ma kill her
John john phenom-enon, in japan they call me ichiban
Wu-tang clan, number won!
In the whole nine, I hold mine
Keep playing with it kid, you might go blind, jerk off!

Hot, even though dames is froze

Leave em with they brains exposed, and stains on clothes

Stay drunk-pissed in the s-type, stay whipping 
When the guns spitting, duck or get hitting

Runnin on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes
Keep the media dykes
As re-enforcements for the fight
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?

Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out

They call me big John stud
My middle name mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood
What up doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sure shot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged
Learn
Temperature's too hot for sunblock
Burn
Playin with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
Cause it's your blood
Murder is tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day

They know not what they do
Our praises do

Why risk it

Knocked out their front teethes
Tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the baseline
To provide rhyme

Hard as nails to the cubicle
Where you find that monster
She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit
Roll on the check
Kick a hole in the speaker
Pull the plug and inject

Mic check
So what's it all about?
Where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
Limpin on the track with Method
So get the sunblock
You get your one shot
Until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in the zone
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back
Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that
Burnin up your brain like a piston
So all those who didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown

Now there's four million niggas tryin to eat at one time
It keeps the thugs gunnin' in the blood runnin'
And the judge frontin'
Enough to make nigga touch something

[Chorus]
Niggas fuckin with that strick-nine
The models get mine
So we gonna be big time
Its ghetto business
Niggas jack cars and rap stars
Rockin' the cash bars
Bitches dancin' naked on their lap
Its ghetto business
Niggas hold guns
Hot ones steakin' the biscut
Ghetto nigga soft cores is ghetto business
Yo, drinks and weed son
Never seeds son
I got what you need son
Its all ghetto business

Yo this is for the senile
Walking on the green mile
My lyrics be like the spirit of a teen gone wild
 
Shit is after ten bitch where's your child
With a nine in his pocket lockin' it down like penile
I did the knowledge to born
Your style straight corn
I woke up in the morning
Heard your shit and just yawned
You fuckin' up my high
No lie
You can die
??????????????
Before I break you up like god
Yo its the herb slinger
New style bringer
Rap is for my war plan
Fat like Corporal Clinger
We still bring the hardcore with r&b singers
While the beast ask you out like hoes on Jerry Springer

Yo rally hot boys feel so sick
And I won't stop 'til I'm so so rich
While why'all niggas spit
I (Whooo) blow hits
Don't waste time
And I don't waste rhymes
Few minutes, shit
Track done like swiss
If you ain't hot come like this
Real niggas hold a gun like this
Pop something, one in your leg
Make your ass run like this
Now picture that
Defeat rhymes never that
Son son you brave
You ain't a man cause you got a little something to shade
I've been a thug since the sixth grade
Rockin' a fade

Young Boomy
Look what the ghetto done to me
Made you bolder now
Heart colder now
Brick soldier now
Gun holder now
Nigga snatch my chain, catch him hold him down
Hit him with the hot slugs like over now
I know you want to test rock, what you waitin' for
I live one-thirty-eight basement door
City up north you can't escape the raw
Find me where channel live be at
(What is this)
Ghetto Business

You ain't fin to blow up shit
You're merely a bomb threat
How the fuck you gonna move a crowd
You ain't moved out from your moms yet
I'm a vet, better yet a vet-er-an
The words Smith and Wessun
Like Megatron
Understand I'm past hip-hop
I should be put into tiny ziplocks
Distributed by those who flip rocks
Leak use after word Smith be	
So dope you better sniff me
And learn to keep me out ya mouth
Get me

I'm goin''to Armaghetto swiftly
My whole click be sickly
So we don't sleep we spit in bed
Those that's trying to get hit in the head
Fuck around and get hit in the head
Everything I write is either a death sentence or a blood line
For those who love nines
We don't stand in club lines
We V.I.P
Thugs love to hear me spit that
If you ain't down with ghetto business
There's the exit punk, hit that!",Ghetto B.I.,2000

Where you don't want to wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks

Rippin' someone's head off

And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days

Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged

Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind

Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me?

Crime is endless

What's the scenario? 
Comin' through your stereo 
Why risk it 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious 
Word on the street is 
They bit my thesis 
Knocked out their front teethes 
Tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline 
To provide rhyme

Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster 
She beautiful 
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit 
Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo

Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down

Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For cheesy, too many want to be hard be easy
It's all N'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes I'm never satisfy like the Stones
We don't condone bitin' see them selling crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap reciting
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home
Tical! (Fuck your lifestyle!)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin' got you feenin' with your pipes out
Time for some action, surfin' the avenue
Mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols
My niggas got issues, again, same song
Armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone.

Yo, I was going too but we roam, cellular phones
Doc-Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spent bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo in ozone
When I, grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
Three nines and a glove with Nasu he dying in the car
While we behind on the bars
Haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up
Now my neighbor dope up
Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt all mammals
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos

Sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump, sippin' on a forty
Yo smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun and Red and Meth gettin' jumped

Yeah come on, Red and Meth gettin' jumped

I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke 
Think I started on the choir singing solo for the pope

You can't wear yellow spandex wit a ass of cottage cheese 
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens 
Toes ""Kriss Krossed"" like she on J. Dupris' team 
Button your sitting up like beach balls in the sand plus 
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand 
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired 
Now I'm looking for some washed up rapper that I can hire 
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude 
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude 
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food 
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong 
For so glowing, Afro picking 
S-curl hating, Jamaican rum sipping 

Kid I'll burp on your girl butt cheeks 

The honey had my nuts like two red beets 
I'm bananas, out of my fucking mind they won't let me back in 
Cause I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund

How I holla at my niggas brings ears to my cries 
Stick niggas for not knowing, then teach 'em something 
Bitch niggas talking bout you from the streets you fronting 
I never liked you, and you, I don't know 
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we goin' go 
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm goin' dust you 
If you can't pick that afro, I'm goin' bust you 
Walking like you was a lil nigga 'cause you is 
And don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids 
Cracking niggas got the nerve to wonder why I rob, why 
You guys will live while everybody else'll starve 
That pretty shit is played, fuck what your name hold 
Break a nigga off something, watch a nigga gain fo'

Who on this? We ain't got shit, Summin Gotz ta Give
Why'll done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the kid
Die and live for my nigs and my bad ass kids
Freeze [sniff], lookin at your ice like PLEASE
Plottin on the mouse trap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is 'bout that, psycho therapy
Fuckin, where the cow chat? Blue till they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not BROKE, let it be
Ain't nuttin nice in, New York, stick ya for ya cake and ya icin
All that tough talk don't mean nuttin when ya up north
So keep them hands where I can see them like ya want freedom
You know that sayin, if ya can't join 'em
Beat 'em and push ya way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the Pace up, past snaggin, throw your waist up

You're like DUDE, I don't like your fuckin attitude
Frontin on my Clan from Shao', we ain't mad at you

Droopy luck, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, ""Ghost, you're so crazy""

Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jew-els, big heat ruffle inside the bubble-goose
It's the odd couple, holo-points follow you home in Staten Island
Playin with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Dunkin 'hinds
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dust heads runnin, the black kingpin buzz the Black Jesus

[Redman]
Yo, the words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the van while the nurse is off
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Till it bleeds from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light curcuits off, thirty-third if my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like them training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stares
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets'll fly)
Yo, a hard wire, startin bonfires
Pullin mask, so you know it's me
Your weave got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke wit'cha, watch Ghost tie rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya

Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak""
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga doin it since Grease
Check out the greys on the side of my waves, my crew doze on Riker's Island
Stretched out, malled up in the cage
Pull a ? out on Jimmy Jam, shakes Space Jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versacis, Snow White rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, boohoo when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym in two weeks, my back all chisseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tony Atlas

Method Man,"Who can be the boss? 
Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me? 
Cause it's your blood 
Murder is tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
Our praises do 
I'm big like easy, ya bigbamboo 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the fuck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the fuck up!

Shut the fuck up! 
What? What? 

Headstrong, deadcon, dead by dawn 
Deadweight they dead wrong 
Let's get it on 
Twelve rounds of throwdown 
Who hold crown? 
Protect land with both pound 
Limp Bizkit 
Get around like merry-go 
What's the scenario? 
Comin' through your stereo 
Why risk it 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious 
Word on the street is 
They bit my thesis 
Knocked out their front teethes 
Tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline 
To provide rhyme 
Pharmaceuticals 
Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster 
She beautiful 
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit 
Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that 
Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down 
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the fuck up! 
Come on a little louder

To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many motherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music

Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point

Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words

They poison, I'm the antitoxin, that keep the party rockin
And got me for us all, Johnny Cochran
Get me off, grant them the ball, if I walk
Put that order in the court, yeah

Panic with the frantic, antic watch them vanish
In the zone, by my own, maricon, if you Spanish
The outlandish, even though they can't stand us
You better off gettin pick a size, tryin to ban us
Either way you put it off, I'mma be heard
That's my word, Stone Cold, Goldberg
Like a nerve, don't fuck what ya heard
That nigga just started hangin out on the curb
What's the verdict, soundin like me, you can't word it
I put it in overdrive, while you short circuit
Worship the ground that I walk on
I brought on, all the real niggas that you talked on
Blahzay Blah, so on, it's a done deal, don't even go on

But I'd be lingering the rest to you, 
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two

Be losing your religion again when the venom kicks in

Living with sin citizen X triple the threat
Mad dog wreck a animal house send in the vets
There it goes picking my nose fixing my clothes
At the same time keeping my flows different from yourz

Low key with the gold teeth half a OZ on my person
Lookin' at y'all niggaz like y'all owe me
For certain, I'm all that my fo'mat
Wearin' out ya do'mat I'm hurtin' commercialized acts

It's a wrap pull the curtain, Long John be long gone
I pop shit and pop more bottles than Sean Don
I got chip, I'm just too ghetto like Banton
Mike V it's all in my jeans like Sean John

All my niggas, let's do it
All my bitches floorin' that ass, let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker, let's do it

Looks a crooked eye motherfucker, let's do it

Ooh, put ya ear to the train track I'm still comin'
I stroke different, after hours ya Phil Drummond
Peel lemons and put 'em in bitches Coronas
Hopin' bitches will bone us, throw they lips on my shoulder

Where all my dirty fingernail tell her right hell
I'm a lay patient to play Jason and when you nightmare
Stop, pop cordureoys and we order toys
Medulla oblongata mean on them waterboys

Gorilla man do whatever
I'm bound to make a fan do the same thing Stan did in a letter
I bounce with a bitch with a ounce on a trip
Take her girlfriend, nut in they mouth when they kiss

And I make 'em scream, I go banana yo
With animal anecdotes with Hannibal hammer loads
You be ducking like the Pope when he bowin'
You get that for touchin' pit throats when they chowin'

All my niggas, let's do it
All my bitches floorin' that ass, let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker, let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked, let's do it
My block, let's do it

Looks a crooked eye motherfucker, let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked, let's do it

Now that's that shit, that makes me zone the fuck out
In the club and get thrown the fuck out
Now ain't that a bitch, if y'all ain't with us then forget us
Miss Ebon [Incomprehensible] hip hop guerrillas

Damn just do the damn thing, ruin the game
For everybody bury the body, ruin my name

Look up to the Cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm dashin' all the media strikes, keep the media dykes
As re enforcements for the fight
And that alone will keep John Gotti on the phone
Yeah

Tangled in his own
I got the Bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?

Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now

Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round
I'll knock him out

They call me Big John Stud

Too much for you thugs

Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood

You get your one shot, until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare

Now you're turned into stone, without a microphone

But don't you forget you're in the zone

And take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston

Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
Take the back seat and smash beats
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off

Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish 
Cherish every moment of his love before you perish

Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you

And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

[Verse One- Styles]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns in around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin up
'cause if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite
I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood

Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand

Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love

You got them fat legs, killin' them Gucci's
Heels on with your fat coochie

Take time, create, yeah, my legend is straight now
Your inner vibe's the side of the juicy

Cheeba queen, [Incomprehensible] jeans, state to state
An' she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'ma scream

Boo, throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours
It's a mornin' blue

Straight mines, that's a warnin', duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped an' designed
Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just eat it this time

We in the front seat, splittin' cigars, I'm on my job
So you handcuffin' ho' ass niggaz, be on your guard

Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like 'Ma' an' 'Boo boo'
So every time I see your girlfriend, never confuse you

With the next down-ass chick that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French, 'Menage a trois'
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off

I'm not as Dirty as that bastard be
But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of 'Ice Cream 2'
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through

Yo, I love my dick size, like I love women an' shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips

Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter, butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split

Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up an' you're lookin' 'Ice Cream' this summer

Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry an' them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious Kim

The big ring, the small hand
A big cake, a bridesmaid, a best man
One day, we gon' have all that

[Ginuwine]
Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

[Chorus: x2]

[Ginuwine]
You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
'cause I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover want to beg to earn, oh baby

Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention 'cause they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, y'all understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine

Method Man,"Three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
The in-flight drug used to induce, the hindsight was dust
The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it
Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin'

Senses and feelings distorted, they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
To complete the mission they had no decision in
No longer do they use our light and dark used to create
The vision in our towns but now, they red and blue override our brown skin

We've been conditioned to let off them rounds
When we see another color rag or hear another brother brag
About what set he claimin', poverty, drugs and poor
Education should be the target but we won't stay gamin' that

We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame
In that like there's fame in that, we hang out them car windows
And bust them slugs in the name of genocide in disguise
So we don't take blame for that but if there's honor amongst
You thieves in life then what the fuck you hidin' for?
Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin' for",Ridin' for Outro,2004

Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up

Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
And this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like

If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me

I'm out...

Once again, it's the super, pied piper
Light your lighters for the future
And I ain't talking about Mekhi Phifer
Roll it if you got it people
At last the Prequel
And the eye ball
Floral is back
You'll find no equals
Bang it in your loudest system
Now who gunna diss him
Usually it be the brokest niggas
But this gunna fix em
Let me get my 2 guns
For rappers that can use help
Now that Meth is back, you can tell me how my shoes felt
Just like Shaq in them size 22's
Except my games not a game
And I don't play by any rules man
Its time to build without a hardhat and goggles
Even with a map I'm still a hard head to follow
I thought you knew we do this everyday ok
And I think marijuana is just nature's way of saying hi
Only hydro buds, I get it crunk
It's alright if that bitch don't smoke then get her drunk
Now I pop a lot of shit, cause I can back it up (what)
I got that fire, bitch, its hard to pass it up (what)
While you'll was partying I been in the lab
You want that dope, give me an hour
Plus a pen and a pad

[Streetlife]
Aiiyo Meth what they look like (look like)
3rd LP nigga better be tight (be tight)
Don't forget where you come from, the hood life (hood life)

[Method Man]
I got that shit that keep your head bobbin
Cause your neck know
Meth yo, I'm trying to get that more dollars then crep flow for certain
Before I put the paint, I put the work in
And each person I catch slipping gunna need nursing
Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around at all
Take it from the most stepped on, your wearing open toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up
My crew stick bitches like you, for acting stuck up
Methods like that y'all, when I return you know the good herb is back y'all

Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones

Six minutes, Method Man, you're on
If you thinkin' you gon' slip and be alright, you're wrong
You can see me lightin' the bong, while writin' the songs
That the crowd, is either singin' to or fightin' along, fightin' along
I'm try'nna tell you drugs is not your friends
And girlfriend, don't try and front like you got your friend
I'm at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
And my chick's a man-eater, she be swallowin' men
Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night
I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light
Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type
If ya'll don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife
When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules
Play with my food, what makes you think I'm playin' with you?
This is it, ya'll better come on in, the water's fine
Jump on in, let's do it to 'em one more 'gain

Method Man,"Like the sweet morning dew,
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.

Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best,
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination.
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more.
All, all the joys under the sun wrapp'd up into one.",I'll Be There for You,2005

You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggaz knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged
Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses
Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it

Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots
Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi

I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint, 
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde,

And got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta

You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat, boo, now hold for a sec.
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose
Before you play the game, know the rules
Cause still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some ice cubes, playing with ya boobs, knawmean

[Chorus]
Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
Cause you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G, like they do it in the hood, and
You give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real, then let's ride

Hey, pretty ma, you look sweat, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to eat
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle and beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy, to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, primadonna, oh my god, mommy, work it
Make a nigga wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her badunk
Double XL, she the ""Eye Candy of the Month""
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big club or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga
To scratch it, and bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it

[Chorus]

Let's ride, I start up on your right
Peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Let's ride, don't need to think twice
I, want you at your time
Let's ride, let's roll, all night, oh lord
Full night, oooh tell me something

Yeah, real man, with ya stinkin' ass
Come on, that's my nigga right there, let's do it
Never count me out, nigga, just count me in, yeah,

Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks
Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone to pick
Now, who that nigga in the zone and shit
Back in the building like he own the bitch, nobody cold as this
If I ain't got it, then it don't exist
I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come
Protect Ya Neck, when you dealing with them
Now Erick stick a fork in him, he done, hah
It boggles the mind, like try'nna 'ketchup' to a bottle of Heinz
It's like forensics try'nna follow the crime, they want time
And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes
While eighty five percent swallowing swine, see
Wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whatever he hone
Long as I got myself a Marilyn loan, phillies are better chrome
If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known
And while I sleep, my bitch be checkin' my phone, cause I'm a problem, nigga

[Chorus]
Ease up, or put them g's up
Scream at ya frog, nigga leap up (now who got a problem with that?)
They need to beast up, nigga, speak up or
Forever hold they peace up (if they got a problem with that)

Yeah, you, nigga, you don't want no problem with that

Look, my Clan all one in the same
Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga
Like Billy Danze, I be running with ""Fame""
Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life
Hard body, another day in the life
Credit his momma now for raising him right, just want the people to know
I'm bout to blow, like I'm shaking the dice
Making me mad? Nah, y'all making me right, cause y'all was taking me light
So let my pen talk and say what he like
And have the court system say and indict, I'm O.J. on the mic
Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe
And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight
Not only raising on the price, on M.C.'ing, but I'm raising the bar
And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car
Motherfuckers I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonnaise jars
Purple haze, Cuban laid cigars, I'm a problem, nigga

[Chorus]

E, you know I'm just like that
Big baller nigga, just like Shaq, so come on, niggaz
If they bust, I better bust right back
Meth spit it from the gut, like *gunshot* man down
I'm that dude, hands down, stare down
I'm past due, for Cash Rule, y'all can't clown
I'm bank now, your ass lose, nothing but rhyme

Ever since I came in the game

And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames

These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real

They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man

They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster

And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive and still the sun'll come out tomorrow

Shine, shine, shine and grind, 'cause it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bulls***, I really got no time, a full clip

Outblew his liver, a river flooded, what's happening?
It's drugs we wanted, gloves buttered, thug coverage
This is Fila, white sneaker, Louis Vitton luggage

I came, representative huddle, they all love you
That W, the legacy of little n****z muggin' you
The f***, what's up with you, yo, you suck, n****
Benches used to pluck n****z, we be on the roof, like ""f*** you""

Them r** b**** is coming, losers, got to walk the plank
Users with U**'s on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers
They should call us, I rock mad ice like a walrus

The lam esters decided to lure us, we was up in Freedom town
Getting w*****, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack
And explore d***, y** c*** f*** with all of us
One of us dropped, there's twenty more of us

Now ask yourself is this for real? it can't be
My n****, if it ain't for real, it ain't me
I elect myself as presidential M.C.
I elect myself as presidential M.C.

Now ask yourself why is he so low key?
Why is n****z pimpin' when the game chose me
I elect myself as presidential M.C.
I elect myself as presidential M.C.

P*** c*** like tangerines, you shook like tambourines
Then jet from the set in the all black Lamborghin'
Nobody seen me, b**** in a tini red bikini
N****z saw her because they thought they saw a genie

Heidi Klum, p*** juicy, fat as a plum
Picture on the wall in jail, n****z jerk til they c***
God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts
Make your squad, throw tantrums

Practice Kamasutra on broads, pop b**s
Leave birds with permanent scars and s*** like birthmarks
Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs
Blow California c****** to despise the smog

This s*** I been with biz in the clearing, pigs sharing
Got fresh, Wu-Wearing, motherf***ers not caring
Then move through your community with diplomat immunity
Move to rep a two or G., shine like fine jewelry

Now ask yourself is this for real? it can't be
My n****, if it ain't for real, it ain't me
I elect myself as presidential M.C.
I elect myself as presidential M.C.

Now ask yourself why is he so low key?
Why is n****z pimpin' when the game chose me

And, if life's a b****, then I bet she bitter and cold

(The world's crazy, son yeah.. you know)
We gon' high to this (just something about her)
My girl's a killa, my girl's a killa
(You know, her bag was always heavy, everytime I been around it)
We gon' high to this (and diners, and restaurants, I don't know)
Yeah... yo...

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I couldn't get enough from the way she smell
Was it Baby Phat, J.Lo, or straight Chanel
Her face belongs in a Luther video, Never Too Much
The way she smile, her face look pretty, though
Hands is soft, feet, no calysses
Her father owned six pallets in palaces
Laying out in New York, crush villas in Vegas
Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest
So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink
Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
""You know what, Ghost, I do hits"" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch

Yeah, this white chick Everlay, she smell Downy
Had her best friend named Jade, from Rockland County
Double cokeheads who love cartoons, type chicks who eat pussy
Listen to Prince and play with they wombs
Flight attendant out of Delta Airline, get money girls
Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M.
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past it
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade
Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!

[Masta Killa]
Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it
This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?

In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing

Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses

Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth

Call me Arab Diesel cuz I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggaz ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited

Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging
Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus
The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on
Like run, son, don't go up in the spot
Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out
Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars
Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying
May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest
Trying to focus, yup, and make progress
That's what I get for slinging in them projects
Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling
Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling
Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch
Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box
You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie
Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw
So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dying laughing, he said ""Yo, Starks, be quiet""

[Method Man]
And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit?
Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong
Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming
Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things
Just run and try to grab the gun
Cuz shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn
There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run
You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K.
State your business, after that, be one
Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block
That the cops trying to lock you for
Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging
You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting, niggas is calling my horn
Police is hitting every corner we on
Can't understand that it's a thug thing, and in the middle of thought
I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon

Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
Your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized by his un Alikeness
Knowledge is the truth and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands

Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13
Professionals wit no things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the P.J.
To Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon

For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds

Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon

I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense

The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus

Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette

Started smokin' woolas at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all

Trying to get a clutch at what I could not

Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth

And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot

To kick the truth to the young black youth

I'm open RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court
For your birthday, the babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books
Annheiser Busch kings came through, and stopped your whole jooks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful, like hearin the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
Love to sit out this song, now watch your water break

Method Man,"When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot

It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
Moving on your left, ah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style'll live forever
Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""sue""
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
I mean oh, you check out the flow
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting
Niggaz off because I'm hot like sauce

First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural

Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments

Method Man,"After laughter, comes tears

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

Method Man,"What y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala

Shoot out the speakers when my guns get Jurassic

No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds

Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Hah! Step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!

The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Coming to a fork in the road which way to go just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart coming on through
Niggas is like ""Oh, my God, not you!""
Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor, coming from the RZA
Which is short for the razor who make me reminisce true
Like Deja, Vu! I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out

Like a three o'clock bully, waitin' after school
Punks, I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin' my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in

Jump, move, crash, drink
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?

I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile

Method Man,"(Let's get ready to rumble)
In this corner we have the funk body snatcher
P Funkadelic and I gotcha hard enough
That I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block

Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush your whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk

That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause 92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose
(Poo pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on

You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3 you're pinned

I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice then Tupac
(Straight outta Jersey)

You heard me, my brother
I'm laughing, time 4 sum action

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer
(Exposition)
Straight from the land of the lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That makes you run your rap style back to the crack vile brotha

Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk stroke a trunk of funk
Then you saw caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw raps

So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick
(The funky fly stuff)
Just to show you where the hell I come from

I get dumb with the 1, 1 2
Check my rep, I'm a hit when I have sex
(Like this)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff

And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother where your eyes at?
There on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour a lil' funk down your brain punk

Listen to my name chump
(Redman ready to rock)
I got a glock
Then, pow, your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to the, the exorcist, kick it

I git mad wicked when the twin cocks the biscuit
And blow your head off, just for askin'
""Who's the one rappin'?""
(Poo pow)
Time 4 sum action

Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid, yeah, know what I'm sayin'
We not goin' for the Okee Doke, believe that
Hit Squad is definitely in the house
(In the house)
For the brothers who don't be knowin' what's up
Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava

Aah, back to the funk track, like Black Sheep
My man, he say, ""Who's the Redman?""
""Where's the Redman?""
I kill, I smother, I get down with the

Method Man,"Why'all ready for this?
Ha! I don't think so!
Yeah! Oh, listen to this!
We gonna come at ya!

Cypress Hill!
Yo yo yo, all my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty 
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house 
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run!
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high

Yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like Simmy Colan
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks 
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

[Chorus]

Take the back seat and smash beats 
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You want to be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cause you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten 
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You want to roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You want to test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off

Pulling a Harley deep with a jar of grease

Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style

Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing

I pause, flick the ash from my L
I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct

Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aah-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men

My aim one since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, runnin' who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

Ayo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin' your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chicken heads gobblin'
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

Aiyyo, one two three four
Five six seven
Blaze the hot trizack
Shine like heaven
Seven six five four
Three two one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

Yo, back when chef mami used to sell plates, we used to sell base
I learned to wipe my nose and wipe the prints off the shell case
Don't want no jail case, freedom miles standing at hell's gate
It's hot, and the devil's my cell mate
The game's addictive, I can't stop, it's like I'm chasing that first high
Like Betty Crocker baking that first pie
The beef we serving is stir fried, swerving all through your urban
Hurting, every gate and corner, you working, I'm
The bottom line, the school of hard knocks turn into Columbine
And my set is throwing up dollar signs
Some get gwop, some get pop, me?
I got a ziplock of bubble gum, just for selling Chris Rock
Nobody move, nobody shot, Meth, I'm in the body shop
Where you rummy, rolling your body drops
I'm trynna stand on my own two, get signed to a major
Be a franchise player and get my own shoe

Since a young buck had fire in my hands
When I was bumping ""Roxanne, Roxanne""
I got gin and an O.J.
Rock 'Friday' to 'next Friday' like O'Shea
Hit the west coast, six four on tray
Doctor Bombay, sick flow all day
I don't play fair, niggas can't see me
That's why I make it do what it do, baby, yeah
You want some, yeah, niggas hit the floor
When I kick in the door, wave in the four four
For sure, Uncle Snoop, where's the coupe?
'Cause I keep a hoe fighting like New York and Hoopz
Strap up your boots, move around
Pick it up like engine number nine
It's mine, homey, Tech, what's good?
And it ain't hard to tell how I rep my hood
You a beast like me, rep your hood
Sign the check when I mic check, one-two

Me? I'm a diamond in the rough in the cut
Like paroxide, got mine frying in the Dutch
Forget about your top 5, try and top mines
Take shine like I got mine ironing your guts
You know I keep it fired up, fire in the hole
To the game, old and tired, I be tired when I'm old
I'm trying to keep it hot like the pile up in the stove
While these rappers losing power putting powder in they nose
Meth, Keith Murray and Redman, yo
Fuck you and your mama on a headband, hoe
You can call the kid a modern day Van Gogh
Take the art to a place where the fake can't go

And if you dress in the metrosexual way, then muthafucka, you gay
Ya'll can save this drama for Kay Slay, like who's fucking my chick
Or writing books about sucking my dick
Now I don't give a fuck what they say, 'cause once I put on my cool
They see my life and wanna put on my shoes
Top of the world, ma, look at your dude
I dig a chick with an attitude, but I don't let her cook up my food
It's like these young niggas hugging the strip
Who got the power to move bricks and buildings never loving the bitch
Stripping with game, ya'll can guzzle a sip, ain't nothing change

I do my crime with baking soda, with no odor

He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns ""That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Y'all just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan

See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook
Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em til I learned to juks
Tried to catch something, everytime I work a hook
Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up
Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up
You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up

[Redman]
When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit
I know eyes on me, when I count to three
Make believe you was indeed a copied MC
You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit
I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me
It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
I got to be out, at the club door with the key out
Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out
Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out
Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out
Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up
Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up
A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up

[Redman]
Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch
Fuck you, that means she swallowed it
I do double on the turn, you must learn
Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm
If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit
Redman is on fire, so call him quick
You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick

We carry rugers, smoking toast on your throat like oolas
Hitting reefer, playing my square, windbreaker jacket
Holding my bear, rock and roll in my Lear
I have to eat, gun carefully, let the cocaine bling
Strings is nothing, get your hoe clapped, king
We hundred burners, onion turners, all this, came out the yard
With twenty five to lifers, loving my squad
You know the gun show off, whips is gleaming, clean as a fuck
In dirty hallways, the ninas'll cluck
This is crime station, my obligation is to look raw as ever
Feed my little sons and patients
Cause they hungry, shining, bullet fly right through the lining
Catch me on the plane, humble and wining
Feeding me, fresh niggas, downtown, Brooklyn in them brook lands
Is Timbed up, looking for them jookes, with my miss and

[Chorus]
Yo, the streets is a part of me
What you witnessing now is don archery
Pack a lambskin hostler, one of these rocks'll soft you over
You ain't nothing, you'se a bitch ass poser
Fiends on your face, on the T-shirt, thinking that you envy the P
Underneath'll be R.I.P.
That's what you get, yo, for being so cocky
Two guns, thumbs up, for me and my posse

Yo, what's the science, little nigga? Yo, you beefing too hard
I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, y'all fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers

[Chorus]

Y'all can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cause of one rat
My block on fire cause of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, 
These cougars wanna play all these
Young cats with pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost

[Chorus]",Dangerous,2010
Method Man,"O, most of the time, yo, I'm flicked up
Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up
Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up
With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up
Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's
Me? I stay outted out, boating on oceans
He banging my old chick, and he mad open
Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days
Shanks out, they ready to move
Somebody yelled out 'ballin'
In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em
That voice, should of slowed down, baby
Now what we gon' tell his lady
Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy
A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately

In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller
The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking

[Chorus]
It's that Wu shit, it's that movement
It's the Wu shit, in the house

Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck
While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect
I'm a done, rebel out of Staten Island projects
I dare y'all to come in my projects
Leave with no head, no neck
You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set
In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake
Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped
Watch how I move the crowd, I'm a make 'em, make 'em clap to this
No shit, no doubt
Two shots of Hennessey, ladies want Goose
Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce
Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe
When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe?
Yeah, right, daddy got bread
Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed
Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head
Walking around in your cheap ass threads
Get away from me, stinky

[Chorus]

Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room
Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb
I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes
No biting's the rule, but we can eat each others food
Flash a camera at the all time great
Single handing increase New York's crime rate
That's why I love it in the Empire State
The city where your fat ass can still find weight
But y'all ain't getting it, the game is different
And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it
Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts
Fighting after school, a lot of y'all got jumped
Staten Island, bro, ratchet under my coat, potato salads so
And we silencing that, just every day challenge us
Check a nigga out of respect, I'm spectacular, this the Massacre",It's That Wu Shit,2010
Method Man,"Yo, blow my nose for me, man
Word up, man (fuck them)

Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch
We them wrist getters, everything real bout this, duke
You fucking with them niggas that's splashed up, slave master's master
Dumb move, blast your slut
We want it all, living in Persia, burn something
Snow White rose, bulldog ershkama
Yo take that, drive that around the corner

Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu
Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce

Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car

Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of y'all dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks
My real world realer than rap
I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical
Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal
That's that shit right there

Dick game super, grupa fish, Cris' Krug' lottos
I'm a bring it back, one wish
Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways
Yeah, always stay
Y'all rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around
When it's going down, I'm gon' rain
That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it

Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say ""Fuck you, pay me""
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doo-rag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, fuck them haters, real talk

Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame
Industry pussies, we can't feel these
Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind
I do this for the nine niggas who forced me
Y'all niggas is playing me, man",Mef vs Chef 2,2010
Method Man,"Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man
Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef)

I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger
Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him
Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping
Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal
Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six
She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, ""Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty"" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall

Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamor girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later

Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on, I'll massage your ego
And be the love of your life, you know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya",Miranda,2010
Method Man,"Yeah, them niggas talking bout y'all always want some lyrics, right?
Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story
That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass
Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh
Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version

Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp
He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll
He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor
Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door
The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie
Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police
Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him
And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him
Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks
With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious
Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate
Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich
You can smell her perfume on every street corner
A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her
Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex
Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons
She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang
Control the south side, her name rings
Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion
Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion
Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis
Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie
In the purse, fifty thou' in cash
Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers
Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy
Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby
I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps
They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me
From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney
Frank War told me, C.C. get that money
My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot
Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils
The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back
Cause these niggas don't know how to act
At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me
Bitch just get in the car, cuz I want you to swallow
I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow
He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos
He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy'
He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro
(Nah, papi) Cause I'm from New York
He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk
Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort
Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork

And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi
This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy
I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby
Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy",Pimpin' Chipp,2010
Method Man,"Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

I got my Ghostface on, cause, I'm a Killah
I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found",Smooth Sailing Remix,2010
Method Man,"For the city, to get this money, Vegas, yo, yeah

Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown
Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down
Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds
Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge
Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens
With a live situation, got it in preparation
When you get there, pick up the whip with the navigation
And follow all the clowns til you get to your destination
(We here Tone, got our masks on, we bout to run up in
I know you ain't talking bout the house, with the broken henge
65 Alpine Drive, it's looking shady
So I hopped out, pulled the glock out, plus the 3-18
Hit the living room, I've seen a ripped up sofa, a shattered coffee table
Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller
The place was ransacked from front to back)
Yo, Trife, what you talking, black?
(Yo, Starks, cut the bullshit and tell me, where the office at)
Take a left and head, down the hallway steps
Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left
The safe is on the wall above the fireplace near the decks
Look inside the top drawer, and get the key out the chest

Damn son, aiyo what's taking this nigga Trife so long (I don't know)
Oh shit, yo Bull, get down, get down, get down
Look at Stark pulling up, son (aw man)
I'm a try to kill this nigga

Aiyo, hurry up I see a car pulling up, windows tinted
Can't really tell who's in it, but, I know it's a rented
Down south plates, Atlanta or, one of them states (yo the cameras on)
Man, I wanna see what's up in those crates
Should I pop off, take his top off, before he get to you
Bully like (Yo, chill, chill, this is what we gon' do) aight
(Go ask for directions, right, I'm a go around the back
Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack)
OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at
Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang)
Two shots go off (Homey trapped inside, quick put the mask on, Sheek)
Fuck it, Bully, let's ride
Shooting out the sunroof, missing and shit
I was too high, still think my Dutchie was lit
Trife running out the building, busting, cussing
Blood everywhere, you had to see this shit (disgusting)",Youngstown Heist,2010

In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping

We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra

This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss

But I'm fine fly guy just to taste ya
Any place wanna be taken
In my mind all I see is dollars and lace
This bad chick just started waving
The crowed running as I make my way
I said hey little mama come before danger
You come around the more I want just a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from so tell me where do you stay

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Come along I tell you a story of greatness
A young nigga want me to stay
From the niggas would frown down in hating
The clown and pussy niggas scared the same
All around the kids hang around and play
5 rounds and you never came
Couple million but he never made it
It's a nightmare thinking that you were famous

Nigga y'all be cupped to make some rain rat
My whole hood jumping out
Yes I did that
Why these ladies wanna cover on my balls back
Skin rebel smooth like butter
Coming from the city where most blocks is amended
We believed there was no need for change
Believe the change and wash it arrange

Method Man,"I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of Satan, niggas be hating but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rapping, it’s real and something you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hating, get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go, whoa
Nasty baby I'm crazy the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smart as half the cats who play me
Brazy, dropping miss daisy hand on my strap
In my zone mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone that's my only hope
And be damned if I'mma chase that with some phony homes
On the real, it be the ones that say we got this, that you ain't alone
As long as I'm here to pull out that Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats conniving, head first into the livest object
That was your man now you ‘bout to die quick over some fly shit
You feel reminded of your fast life ventures and winters
Blinded to the flashlight enters

And when I kill ‘em with the flow ain't no coming back
And when I kill ‘em with the flow ain't no coming back

I got a poor man's panache, I be stretching the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive, you get a stretcher when I'm mad
For the line, manic depressive, rappers stressin' me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gonna leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expecting a clash
Start to waving arms at you, you'd think I'm catching a cab
No questions ‘cause the answers
Look at Meth, breaking bad like he cooking meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag
Fuck swag, just being blunt, while I'm plucking my ash
Y'all ain't up in my class in the building
It's A$AP Meth, quick to kill 'em, that's an ASAP death

And when I kill ‘em with the flow ain't no coming back
And when I kill ‘em with the flow ain't no coming back

Straight out the back, dog, I'm Shaq strong, I'm breaking backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body
I play the back of clubs, click a file, young as a
Fools get rowdy, ain't nothing dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rollin' a fonzi
You know the fronto, send to your guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connect Vassandro, the illest y'all know
Killing 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes, though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leanin', that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90’s era shit in effect
Clowns be watching, best protect yah necks

I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque
I love trucks but drop-tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex, watch me
Haha, she like ""Red so cool""
Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it!

Hop in my truck and roll up the window
A-yo, you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner, light up the endo
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo
Yes she with me getting low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aah-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

Method Man,"Yeah, yeah
Hey yo, Hey yo

It’s like I’m trapped inside a cage
I can’t explain this type of rage
It’s not a moment or a phase
But possibly the end of days
Watch as I stand up on the stage
Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane
They say it’s levels to the shit
I say it’s levels to your brain
You can’t acquire the higher
You’ll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money
And bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who can’t walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies
Meant to destroy your brain
I’m fitting to go supernova
Expose em to superflames
Soon as I pick these locks on these psychological chains
The answer is in the question
The question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain
But the brain is just a box where information remains
As I try to remain a soldier, the voice in my head explains

I’m still shadowboxing lungs and oxygen
This an icebreaker, no bubblegum was popping
Another hot concoction trick, ya might need amoxicillin
The kid’s too sick, You're gonna need shots to kill em
My method is ill, Doc admit him
When I see you, ICU can get em
Your boy give em bars until the judge acquit him
The court can’t convict him or find the gloves to fit him

Jealous ones still envy, That’s Jose
Peace to Cartagena, I flow hey
But I don’t speak Spanish, yo no se
I’m a seasoned veteran, obey
Obtain a freestyle, it’s cold pay
The old me, resort to my old ways
My old man was stuck in his old days
Still he wanna blaze like John but rapping ain’t in his forte

Look how we did it to ya
Y’all just don’t get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you

My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
Im’a get it to ya x4

It was only the elite who could walk these streets
With jewels and not get stuck
Niggas didn’t give a fuck
Real G’s know I’m talking about
Taking what you making, stripping what you wearing
Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek
This is how we meet and greet
Enemy across the street
Leaning on his Rover jeeps
Smiling, showing all teeth
Seeing son in my hood, it ain’t all sweet
And you haven’t earned the respect
Of those who come, creep and take money
So you just food that niggas come eat
And they don’t get no chain back
You might see em rocking that
Fuck you looking at? Problem needs solving
You see that big 357 thing revolving…revolving

Yeah, you niggas ain’t street
My money talks word of mouth
I figured you out
The life I live, you’re not about
Price on your head, I’m taking cash advances
I’ll take my chances, then deal with the circumstances
Livin’ off the land like a land shark
I’m on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce
Idle times a devil
Playground, make moves
Watch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove
Hands high, say hello to my little friend
Point the finger at the bad guy, it’s me again
Who are they to criticize me?
I do it like a G
I’m a nigga from the mutha-fucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble
I was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle

This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed, motherfucker

Welcome to the meth lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, back 'til you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
'Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
'Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you lie, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So at your court hearin', judge show me some leniency
Can't escape old havoc, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your car seat, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

What up, Street?
Yo, what up, man?
We gon' put some ""Welcome to the meth lab"" on there

Yo, you ever been face-fucked with a four-fifth?
Sweating, facial expression is stressing like 'oh shit'
That's the shit that I don't like
Non-rappin' rappers in the booth and they don't write
Fuckin' stupid ass rappers
Acting out of their character, I shoot and stab rappers
P! What it do, nigga?
I fucks with Wu-Tang and a couple of new niggas
I don't weirdo with queer clothes
I share flows, when it enter your earhole
Shit, it's a thing of pure beauty
Everything that's spittin' is written by yours truly

Niggas do anything for it like Klondike Bars

A hater get it worse

They gon' have to put your image on a shirt
'Til I finish my dessert, nobody eatin'
That's everybody, I mean anybody
I might leave somebody bleedin'
Or watch me catch a homi', even hit you in the lobby
Shotty pop ya like a molly, probably leave you hardly breathin'
Don't try to Blaze with Johnny even if you got an army
Dirty money in the laundry, don't ask why, I got my reasons

My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho bark for my mistress
Pipe is good, live every day like it is Christmas
Happy New Year—I do what the fuck I wanna do here, nigga
Splash the handcrafted Gucci from the shirt to the shoe wear
I crush the rings out, wife-beater tee with no wings out
I got stamina, I'll long-dick a bird 'til she sings out
La-la-la-la, Bobby Dig convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classic like Impala
Plus, I'm federal, when it comes to making dollars
Like Jiggaman, nigga, if you hear me, fuckin' holla

In the valley of Ohio, outside the town of Canton
Or the grotty body projects in the Killa Hills of Staten

I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous (yeah, yeah)
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me? (Ayo, ayo)

Ayo, Wu-Tang forever

My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)

Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland
Yeah, we comin' for all of 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal
Smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone

Ayo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green
Seats is piped off
Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wile out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement: stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'

The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs
Puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
Ill-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun smokey, Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands-off from digital
Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school
Wu B This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these roots

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, you might get hurt

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

[Verse One: RZA]
Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this b**** advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Bla** and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Ain't what you want baby

Everyday, DLO jacket he gripped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy started haveta brown skin derby
Master Tommy Hil Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine

Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cap and fleece wear
One wear plaids the Don will hold the best for all wear

Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby

Now yes, Apocalypse now, the gun blow
It be going down, diggy diggy down diggy down down

Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold cold, so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey-ass
And yo my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
They get me mad, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a licking off a hip-hop
Fuck the billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your billboard spot

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spot smoking buddha on a train
HOW HIGH So high that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
HOW HIGH So High that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So Sick that you can suck my dick

Till my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on till the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed we got our fucking own
Check it I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screaming for the antiseptic
Moving on your left kid, and I'm Method
Out my fucking dome piece, plus I got no love for the beast
Hailing from the big East Coast, where niggas pack toast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats

Hey boy, you's the rude boy on the block
You try and stop the bum rush you will get popped

He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like ricochet rabbit
I brings havoc with an A-K matic, rolling blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smif'n'Wes who clicks the best
Punks take a sip and test, who split your vest
The funk phenomenon, I'm bombing you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with or played with
Fuck them pretty hoes, I love those Section 8 Bit-ches
Hitting switches, twisting wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Digga boo
Scared you, blew you to smitha-reens
Fuck the Marines, I got machines

That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the waltons
Down south, the forty-four feela
I'm a dolo nigga, you a polo nigga
I'm an uptown shopper, you a soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, method man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(blaze one) blaze one (blaze one) blaze one
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit

Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept

Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights

Back to avenge his own death on this Earth

Down to the basement, the dog get it first

The voices in my head just won't leave me alone

Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place

Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here

Method Man AKA Johnny Blaze,"I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing, hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it dick up in you fuck ya

Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching, and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA, to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryin to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies
At a whack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, killa hill projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now",Shadowboxin',1995
Methodman & Redman,"Bitch!
Brick city, yo
Yo, yo funk doc straight lunatic since young
I ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the waltons
Down south, the forty-four feela
I'm a dolo nigga, you a polo nigga
I'm an uptown shopper, you a soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, method man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(blaze one) blaze one (blaze one) blaze one
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.l. an red
Ja rule with hot nix I'm the best at that shit

See the kid rock bumpin' up and down 
Your block with no cares long hair swingin' middle 
Fingers in the air people stare n point I hit 
The joint and laugh - kiss my ass, the past is 

More than 10 years I've known from a complete 
Unknown to the hot zone, million dollar home 
And a diamond ring never thougt I'd amount to 
A damn thing, I'm the man sing like Curtis 

May mack on ho's like Ruby Ray, its been a 
Long time comin' but you know what's happenin'...
Straight pimpin' I'm sitting five times platinum

Like a snake shed my skin leave my past where 
I've been...can you feel what I feel to hold on must be killed 
Don't cry over what's been spilled, can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel? =2x",New Skin [Featuring Kid Rock],1999
