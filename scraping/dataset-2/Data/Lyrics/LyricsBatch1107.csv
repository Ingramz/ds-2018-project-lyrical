The Crown,"It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
It's not over yet - Racing down these dead-end streets
There's no time to repent - Festering demons to hatred sworn
What we have sown - Is ours to reap
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
As we watch the angels die
In the lake of sulphur - We'll watch 'em drown
A massacre divine
Blasphemous locust in genocide reborn
The beating of your heart
Echoing in silence - The sound of death
As your soul is torn apart
A violent cry of pain - Riding your final breath

It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might



",Crowned in Terror,2002
The Crown,"Death is the hunter - Breathing down your neck
The Force that will tear - Your forthless life to shreads
The stench of fear upon your dying breath
Charging forth
I am the hunter by death possessed
Prowling - Insane from hunger - Bt terror blessed
I raging thirst for death - Behold the endless depths
A surge of power - In darkness I descend
Your souls are mine - Together down the line
Through your death I am reborn in a crimson tide
There will be no mercy given
From my blood-stained scythe
Death is The Hunter
I am the hunter - Stalking - defenseless prey
Through your death I am reborn
In me you'll find your bane
Watching as the innocent they flee
You know there's no escape
Beware my killing spree
Through your death I am reborn in a crimson tide
There will be no mercy given
From my blood-stained scythe
The grin across my face
The hunger in my stare
As I feed upo your fear
I am the hunter - Your worst fucking nightmare
Death your release - I will set you free!
Death is the hunter - Breathing down on your neck
The Force that will tear - Your worthless life to shreads
I am the hunter - Stalking - defenseless prey
Through your death I am reborn
In me you'll find your bane
Through your death I am reborn in a crimson tide
There will be no mercy given
From my blood-stained scythe
The grin across my face - The hunger in my stare
As I feed upon your fear
I am the hunter - Your worst fucking nightmare
Death your release - I will set you free!



",Death Is the Hunter,2002
The Crown,"Counted, counted, weighed and parted
Ripped to pieces - Ruled and numbered
Hands of doom - Break your wings - Bury you alive
Die before death - Nowhere to hide
A cold systematic ritual - Of silent choking torture
Pain beyond pain - Lay your soul to waste
Drive your dreams to dust
So I wreak my revenge - Draped in disguise
Huse of Hades - Open for me
Strength in darkness - Blasphemy
Smiling at the gates of hell
Pure soul distortion
Death Metal Holocaust - Death Metal Animal
We're shadows - Living dead
Ghouls to this world
Wilder, wilder, wilder, wilder
Counted, counted, weighed and parted
Wilder, wilder, wilder, wilder
Ripped to pieces - Ripped apart
My spirit exiled
My mind like space
My body - a weapong
Like a bullet through the void
Motorgods of apocalypse
Blood-engined Death-machines
High-speed Lords of the Underworld
Soul Hulks on the other side
A Natural force
Death black massive
Timeless storms
Ripping through the void - Like a roaring lion

Stalking the earth
With all sins of the world - Upon your shoulders
Morbid fullfillment of obscure dreams
Pure soul distortion
Awaken reprisal - The young blasphemic assault
Death Metal Holocaust - Death Metal Animal
Death Metal Holocaust - Death is The Crown Of All
Rotting, cursing, clawing at your coffin!



",Death Metal Holocaust,2002
The Crown,"Don't you try to follow me - 'Cause where I go
No one can ever last - Everlast
I won't turn back - I won't burn out
Won't fade away - So get down on your knees
On your knees
Take a breath and die away
There's a gate to hell in every dream
And you don't know that in the end
All roads lead to that same dead end street
Dead end street
If you wanna taste some death
Here's a trip to the other side
Driven - Drugged unholy forever
Addicted to the sins of the devil
Drugged unholy - I am of cancer
Take my mind - Kill every answer
Preacher won't you just shut up
- 'Cause I don't give a fuck
No I don't care - I don't care
To you who try to put me out
Just watch me now
I'll make you feel my hell - Feel my hell
You won't believe what your soul can buy
Just get deep down and make the deal
In dreams - In drugs - In death and in heaven
Addicted to the sins of the devil
In dreams - In drugs - In death and in heaven
All is gone - Kill every answer
Are you ready - Do you dare - To take that step
Cross that line - Leave it all behind
I am ready - I don't care - So close my eyes
Blow my mind - Bless my soul tonight
Feel the darkness kicking in
Sweat it out that goddamn pain!
Bite my lip and breath the blood
Sucked through the teeth
I'll spit it back to you - Back to you
Pushed too hard for much too long - The night is hard
Cold steel rains down the street - Down the street
Wasted - Vicious - Gone for sure
But I survive I am still alive
Upon a world without no hope - My body walks My
Mind goes on and on

On and on, on and on, on and on
Beyond the pain - Beyond the grave
Beyond the law - Beyond it all
Driven - Drugged unholy forever
Addicted to the sins of the devil
Drugged unholy - I am of cancer
Take my mind - Kill every answer
In dreams - In drugs - In death and in heaven
Addicted to the sins of the devil
In dreams - In drugs - In death and in heaven
All is gone - Kill every answer
Drugged unholy - Wasted and vicious
So fucking gone now - This is all madness

In the shadows we await

Out for blood - Out for blood
We only come out at night
To drain you of your life

",Satanist,2002
The Crown,"Those you know - Don't speak
Those you speak - Don't know
Knowledge no words can contain
In the silence between your chattering thoughts
You dream of light that do not die
Well think again
Saying prayers for your soul to save
You're wrong again - Helpless, weak and afraid
Drawn into the light of doom
And like moth to the flame
You're consumed - Belief - As hollow as fear
Darkness - The way of the force
The Speed of Darkness - Rebel soul
The Speed of Darkness
Riding with the Speed of Darkness
Faster than the speed of light
Together with the Speed of Darkness
Shining through the night
From Darkness all is born - And to Darkness all return
You try so hard to follow - I can't be lost
When free of all illusion - There is just force
The way of no roads
The freedom here at the peak of time
The Speed of Darkness - Rebel soul
The Speed of Darkness
Riding with the Speed of Darkness
Faster than the speed of light
Together with the Speed of Darkness
Shining on through the night
The Speed of Darkness
Hell - For the helpless ones
I take and make it my heaven
Hell - For the helpless ones
I am at one with Darkness

Before the beginning - After the end
Like cattle who in panic flee - From the fire
You will run in fear until you fall - All burning
(But) those who stand and turn
Towards the flames - Through the inferno
Shall survive on the other side
Where the ground is cleansed
For those who turn to Darkness
Are in Endlessness
The Speed of Darkness - Rebel soul
The Speed of Darkness
Do you know - The Speed of Darkness
Faster than the speed of light
Together with the Speed of Darkness
Shining on through the night
Riding with the Speed of Darkness
Faster than the speed of light
Forever with the Speed of Darkness

",The Speed of Darkness,2002
The Crown,"A wicked heart prowls through the void
That lives dormant deep inside
In violent rapture now behold
The harvester of souls
At the seven gates the seal is broken
As sulphur dreams unfurl
Into the depths of no return
Your souls will be cast to burn
Suicide - Dead inside - Inject your horrors' blood
Hell unfurls - On the world
But no-one seeks the cause
To decide if the life is wirth all its' pretend
Hollow shells - Left to die
Seeking still the spark of life
As I cast aside the chains of life
A world below for us - Born to die
It takes a poisoned heart to see the light
Buried deep inside
Spewing forth the burning black
Suicide - Dead inside - Inject your horrors' blood
Hell unfurls - On the world
But no-one seeks the cause
To decide if the life is wirth all its' pretend
Hollow shells - Left to die
Seeking still the spark of life
As I cast aside the chains of life

Afraid inside - Born to die - Left aside
Staring down into a World Below

As I cast aside the chains of life

",World Below,2002
The Crown,"Into the crypts
The pits of the end
We are thrown towards the black
The earth opens wide for our violent descend
Nightmare visions attack
Tired lives in regression
Vicious circles close
Upon a world of chaos
Lack of time will take its' toll
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast for flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!

Hunted down hard you beg for relief
From stress - From pressure - From life
Pain will plague uout lives built on deceit
Your dreams of utopia were lies!
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast for flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!
Deafened by the beat of vulture wings
As they circle overhead
They ride the wings of retallation
Upon an unsuspecting prey descend
On the receiving end of a hatred blind
Darkness closes in on tired lives
Hounds of hell encircle thee
Under the whip - Our nightmares come alive!
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast of flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!

Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blind



",Under the Whip,2002
The Crown,"As cold as ice The satanist heart No vain strife To reach the goal The fullmoon shines within
The temple of the mind As the way unfolds By its own
...Glistening... - ...Immalucate...
All that is gold does not glitter Not all those who wander are lost The old that is strong does not wither
Deep roots are not reached by the frost From the ashes a flame shall be woken From the shadows a new
Light shall spring Renewed is the hope that was broken As the crownless again shall be king
Harmony and blasphemy As one with the light and the void Beyond sun and stars
Luscious - Gorgeous by pound Through honey crush produced Flood eternity and its whispered moan
I dream a thousand diamonds Delirous mind Leave the symphony behind

...Stillness Summer's sad blood Rain put through void...

The church strikes midnight For your rotten soul Pay for your sins We hit your lies Mad as drunk forests
Scream like life under light As your soul's being dragged through 365 chambers of pain
...Forever!

Run with heave - Over you are

Why soar time Delicate moments of hazy tripping Above and about When after swimmed away
As some melting wax ANd their ugly frantic worship Is easy gone
As rust rose Next shadow nears Raw and repulsive
Our lives ache As the sweet days recall Love always drives your head Show my one true road
When all is one - Are you morbid? On the other side - Are you morbid?
When all is one - Are you morbid?
Are you morbid?
- When all is gone...



",Are You Morbid?,2003
The Crown,"Panic comes, something behind me, something above me sharpening its claws
- ""Cover your hear, cover your heart, cover your hear"" my logic says but always too late
Bliss is at my reach again. But it always seeks to stab me from behind
- ""Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart"" my logic says but once again late
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none in the final hour
Pinned down, force-fed on truths. All sense destroyed only instinct prevails.
- ""Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart"" mind divides - new ways find sides
Pain, self-afflicted pain, is always there to pull me back again
- ""Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart"" time goes on still scarred inside
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none in the final hour
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none, I bow to none in the final hour



",Bow to None,2003
The Crown,"Through secrets of the dirty streets Searching for a revelation Wingless angels in the heat Knocking on
The doors of damnation Come on baby - Kick 'em in! Feels like flying - When we are falling One more time

Ready to die Wild for the night Death comes pale Cold is the grave Blackout under neon lights
Throwing up in desperation Laughing in the face of sorrow The heroes of my generation
Come on baby - Knock 'em out! Dance on fire - Slip in blood One more time

Ready to die Wild for the night Death comes pale Cold is the grave

Through secrets of these blood drenched streets Still hunting for a revelation Wingcut angels in the heat
Banging on the doors of damnation Come on baby - Kick 'em in Feels like flying - When we are falling
Come on baby! - Knock 'em out! Dance on fire - Slip in blood One last time
Ready to die Wild for the night Death comes pale Cold is the grave



",Cold Is the Grave,2003
The Crown,"I am already given - To the power ruling my fate I do not hold on - Thus I have nothing to defend
I have no thoughts - Thus I shall see I fear of nothing - Thus I remember of myself
Unmighty, unforced and unbound I shall be like a sound into silence Unmighty, unforced and unbound
I shall spread like a wind into infinite?
Oh what blind joy! What hunger to finish the air that we breathe All that we are
To consume all our being In one great laughter

Why not always live - In that aura of magic That gives every moment - Its weight of wonder
That always is found - In that final hour When life is a dream - Already over
Grow back those silent wings of holy pride That the wheels of the world keep on breaking down
Awake from your sleep - It is time! Cause life is a dream...
...Already over!
Beauty and strength, leaping laughter, force and fire - Are of us
Feast and rejoice! Every day and night - In your hearts Pleasures of uttermost delight
Knowledge and rapture - No dread hereafter
Every end is a new beginning - When one door is closed another is open In the pure joy of existence
And its kisses of eternal esctasy Lose is the law - Love under will As the dogs of reason
Perish with the fall of because
I can tell from the sorrow in your smile That there is nothing left to believe in - For you
Nihil Rise - For me Freedom lies!
Oh what blind joy! What hunger to finish the air that we breathe All that we are
To consume all our being In one great laughter Upon this path There is no me I have become the way
I am one I am none



",Dawn of Emptiness,2003
The Crown,"Now Watch! The grand deliverance opens up like cuts in the skin It'll show the roads and take you where
You've never been Returning and burning - Feel the barriers explode From the barrel of aggression it's time
To reload This organic ammo moves faster than these eyes can see Those bullets kill the distance in just as
Fast as speed can be Returning and burning - Feel the barriers explode From the barrel of aggression it's time
To reload Black - the ace of shades - Strikes through the veins of the lame The face of the target is
Selfdestruction and its tongue speaks your name

Deliverance - The soul explodes Down on your knees you have
Some bullets to please The clips are full and there's a trigger to pull Down Down Down - And fill another round
The conflict is you - You better take on this fight From the ballistic wombs, here comes your death in flight
The more you grind your hate the sharper it'll get You've seen nothing yet
Rising yet falling - The paradox in tribulation And the field turns bloodred as the colours of frustration
Misantropic hightime holds the rhythm to your rhyme But still the hesitation is magnetized to your spine

What will make you cross the line...?

Black - the ace of shades - Strikes through the veins of the lame The face of the target is
Selfdestruction and it weaks your name Deliverance - The soul explodes Down on your knees you have some bullets to please
The clips are full and there's a trigger to pull Down Down Down - And fill another round
And so the grand deliverance opens up like cuts in the skin Now you know it - You've always been here within

Deliverance - The soul explodes Down on your knees you have some bullets to please The clips are full and
There's a trigger to pull Down Down Down - And fill another round Deliverance - The soul explodes
Down on your knees you have some bullets to please The clips are full and there's a trigger to pull
Down Down Down - And fill another round

Clothes that make them weep

At the burnin' and of a satellite town
Where windows smash or shine
Lovers bleed take what they need
From the deaf dumb and the blind

Oh, don't sell your love
Oh, don't sell your love too cheap

It's like diggin' a hole, just standin' around
Every single fuckin' day that goes by, I miss too of
My friends outside are gettin' fewer and fewer

And I feel like I'm sittin' on a human sewer
Mother fuckin' nature like I never ever knew her
Make the same mistakes over and over again
And I stop to explode all over my friends

I'm so scared now, I don't know who I am
I guess I'm a man, yeah, I'm only human
I've got no fuckin'' strength of body and mind
'Cause the days go on just like I'm doin' time
There's a soul suckin' strap at the top of my spine
I gotta get straight walk a straight line

Everywhere you look today there are people livin' lies
If they can't get the truth they want
They're quick to compromise
Suck a little bit here, suck a little bit there
Till they think they're satisfied

Keeps them crawlin' back inside

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

The Crusaders,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like superman
All day and all night
And i won't say if it's wrong or if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself
But i do have some advice to pass along
Along in the chorus of this song

Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don't look down

An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love, and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupid's bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine, and she asked me
B-B do you think I've lived my life all wrong?
And i said, the only advice i have to pass
Along in the chorus of this song

Better not look down

I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In London, England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the queen of England
Looking tired
Just go back from a party, and the queen leaned out and
She said, aren't you b.b. king? she said,
Oh B-B, sometimes it's so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think i ought to do?
And i said

Better not look down

What's in they heart they spit it out
I play my part and get about
What God commissioned me to do
And the fact that that's my co's
Got me pissy in this booth
See it's tricky with the truth
Cause everybody got they own take
I'm a give it how I live it
Till my blood, sweat and bones ache
Watch me bake my own cake
Money mixed with purpose
As long as the hooks made it
All these fick official purchase
Whatever Bubba cast out
I pray to him that that's clout
Cause if it's not I'm in the gap
Spittin' hot but ass out
And this will be my last bout
In the ring with the demon
Cause my belly don't stay full
When I sing just for dreaming
And my team's just a clinging
Feemin for my arrival

I'm bringin' it for survival
Thinkin' I might be able
To fold at any minute
So if you got some silver
Throw in some pennies with it

With the beast of our behavior
Let you sell it for a minute
Take some for your enjoyment

The troops is rallied for deployment
In a war with twenty doggies
They probably won't bark
But they still bit yo ass
Tell Betty to get the cash
? you ? mommas
Get you back on dry land
I'm thinkin' higher track of powers
As you raise your right hand
Have you ever wondered why
I don't approach you at a venue
Like honey where the beans
Like you know it's on the menu
Yeah I spoke to him too
He came to me the same
Told him naw but I'm looking
Now get away from me you lame

Told several talkazoid
That don't toot but do shoot
Got two cousins in the grange
Hard like ? and loop ?
So push that woop woop
When you want a dirt road
'cause if you trying to shout
They make you whine like ?
And bet, I sure ?
Six blonds with big asses
In a ? of suction cups
Everytime I dick passin
Plus I got battallions
As simple than Nelly beats
So next time you out in Athens
Remember to yell at me
So I can page Duddy Ken
To give clearance for your appearance
Look at this loose sock
The spirit of my deliverance
So when that shit said
That we obviously gives a head
That's why I don't fuck wit why y'all

California Capital mix
The Adolf Wilson House and tricks
You want to close shop on Hip-Hop 
With some bullshit politics (follow me now see, see I be Rockin)
Even though they plotting block what I'm talking
Ain't no stomping Dropin on tracks 
for the 16 Hip-Hop fiend since ""Billie Jean""
And when the message had meaning
But now (echoes) there's too much anxiety
It's like a socialist Activist 
Up in the Capitalist society and where I'm living 
that's a prefect example of this Institution
And the constitution plus the preamble
It's tricky but not like DMC it's trick tricky
The ways of this community 
Now I ain't lookin for the cities support 
I know you gotta pick-up K Street and fix up Sutters Fort
since 1849; the Golden State's greedy 
and Mr.Wilson hates Chicano's and condemns graffiti
Sacramento Symphony got cut back even starvin
Artist struggling the Ssreets of Sac barely alive breathing
Even our so called homeless I hate fuck it 
It's like crabs in a bucket in the chain we should be above it in

Sacramento   4x

[Crush]
You could gimmie a S simply cause I 
Slay's the slur's I plays with words 
I announcing verbs with those Intervibing  
Gimmie a A cause I attack acrobatically
Methodically modulating adversaries is mad at me
Gimmie a see cause I control 
continue to create chronicles for your body and soul
I need a are for being ready to regulate
Ready to demonstrate staying steady
I'm collecting feddy in another way 
I need another A since I was young I heard my mother say
""Always achieve,"" now I believe
I need a M mostly for Motivation 
I'm making my music my main mental vocation
Gimmie a E for excellent execution experience 
Entertaining expert getting loose
And then a N now cause I got news Notorious
Niggas known nationally we giving others news
And then a T right now for tuff beats thoughts 
I think tend to Get treated like tasty treats
And then a O for overcomming obsticles 
Overtaking opponents we put them in hospitals in

[chorus 4x]

Uh..uh trying to figure If I should rap at all
about the capital of cali the cover up under hate
Long waits stuck in the valley but we strong 
Like radar doppler topple over I know your Washingtons like Rover 
And I could barely get a penny 
For my thoughts though I taught my town plenty
Yet and still since the intent to resent me
Since the cafe I let it be known 
I got way too much love for my city
what's my city got for me no Divey 
Just some bullshit shows and some turned out parties
If I sound angry when you see me 
Bustin that shit you wrote recently and passed me
with one of them 4 track underground dimey cause that's what's in me 
The Sacramento stay core the rich to 2 for to 48 but that's a gimmie 
Dummies take my tapes and make some mummies you coud hear em 
Get structure like a pyramid, fucked ya when ya weary 
Water in the hog thick like sackfog pass me a dollar if ya hear me

[chorus 4x]

Too many politicians, businessmen, policemen
On some anti-us mission
We're lockin the subs the best solution
Can't hustle tapes without getting hassled by somebody
Hand out flyers and get harassed by somebody
In Sac Town if your creative that's a crime 
And they got it locked down so you can mentally do the time
And you could say who why don't ya but that would be a pity 
but there would be no more Hip-Hop in River City

And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Lost and lonely

The Cure,"On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
Suddenly
A movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up
In the shivering cold

And the Spiderman is always hungry",Lullaby [Album Version],
The Cure,"No I won't do it again, I don't want to pretend 
If it can't be like before I've got to let it end 
I don't want what I was, I had a change of head 
But maybe someday... 
Yeah maybe someday 

I've got to let it go and leave it gone 
Just walk away, stop it going on 
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long 
But maybe someday... 

I'll see you smile as you call my name 
Start to feel, and it feels the same 
And I know that maybe someday's come 
Maybe someday's come... 
Again! 

So tell me someday's come tell me some days come again... 

No I won't do it some more, doesn't take any sense 
If it can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest 
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense 
But maybe someday... 

I'll see you smile as you call my name 
Start to feel, and it feels the same 
And I know that maybe someday's come 
Maybe someday's come... 

If I could do it again maybe just once more 
Think I could make it work like I did it before 
If I could try it out 
If I could just be sure 
That maybe someday is the last time 
Yeah maybe someday is the end 
Oh maybe someday is when it all stops 
Or maybe someday always comes again...",Maybe Someday,

If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much
Been too unkind

I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try and laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness
Plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry

I would tell you
That I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
That you've already
Gone away

Misjudged your limit
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more

Now I would do most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry",Boys Don't Cry,
The Cure,"She stands twelve feet above the flood 
She stares 
Alone 
Across the water 
The loneliness grows and slowly 
Fills her frozen body 
Sliding downwards 

One by one her senses die 
The memories fade 
And leave her eyes 
Still seeing worlds that never were 
And one by one the bright birds leave her 

Starting at the violent sound 
She tries to turn 
But final 
Noiseless 
Slips and strikes her soft dark head 
The water bows 
Receives her 
And drowns her at its ease 
Drowns her at its ease 

I would have left the world all bleeding 
Could I only help you love 
The fleeting shapes 
So many years ago 
So young and beautiful and brave

I used to see her die
She would move so slow

He lays her down, he frowns
""gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""where have all papa's heroes gone?""

Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

Do you remember, bill, you have to pay
Or even yesterday?

Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that barbie doll

Over my shoulder but no one's there

And die 
And take a stand to change my life

A hidden rage consumes my heart 
Fueled by years of wasted time 
I close my eyes 
And tense myself 
And screaming 
Throw myself in fury over the edge 
And into your blood 
Tear at flesh 
And rip at skin 
And smash at doubt 
I have to break you 
Fury drives my vicious blows 
I see you fall but still I strike you 
Again and again 
Your body falls 
The movement is sharp and clear and pure 
And gone 
I stop and kneel beside you 
Drained of everything but pain 

Screaming throw myself in fury 
Over the edge and into your blood 

Kiss you once and see you writhe 
Hold you close and hear you cry 
Kiss your eyes and finish your life 
Kiss your eyes 
Finish your life

Dressed in white and slowly dreaming
Stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never though I'd say those words

Further we go
And older we grow
The more we know
The less we show

The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon

Oh remember
Please don't change

And so the fall came thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name

Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

And the thoughts it brings
The darkness can sometimes
Be a pleasure to me

I stand around on the outside
I've been peering from the edge
Looking for the answers
To the questions I'll never ask

It's from this place we'll find our peace
And reconcile our bitterness

We have to, we have to break
Break, break, break
Wash away, wash away

It's form this loneliness
And the fear it brings
That new doors can open up
And be a savior to me

So open my mind
(I'll)
Open my heart
It's the only way to breathe

It's just a trick of the lights she said
So don't panic, now don't panic

It's from this place we'll find our peace
And reconcile our emptiness
We had to we had to break, break, break
Wash away

It's just a trick of the lights she says
So don't panic, now don't panic

Blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees
As he plays on his knees

Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
A sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And the sky and the impossible explode

Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone forever

Stood a weary grayish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

How beautiful you are!""

Well I'll try and explain.
You remember that day in Paris 
When we wandered through the rain 
And promised to each other 
That we'd always think the same 
And dreamed that dream 
To be two souls as one 
And stopped just as the sun set 
And waited for the night 
Outside a glittering building 
Of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us 
Stood a weary greyish man 
Who held a child upon his back 
A small boy by the hand 
The three of them were dressed in rags 
And thinner than the air 
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you 

The father's eyes said ""Beautiful! 
How beautiful you are!"" 
The boy's eyes said 
""How beautiful! 
She shimmers like a star!"" 
The childs eyes uttered nothing 
But a mute and utter joy 
And filled my heart with shame for us 
At the way we are 

I turned to look at you 
To read my thoughts upon your face 
And gazed so deep into your eyes 
So beautiful and strange 
Until you spoke 
And showed me understanding is a dream 
""I hate these people staring 
Make them go away from me!"" 

The fathers eyes said ""Beautiful! 
How beautiful you are!"" 
The boys eyes said 
""How beautiful! She glitters like a star!"" 
The child's eyes uttered joy 
And stilled my heart with sadness 
For the way we are 

And this is why I hate you 
And how I understand 
That no one ever knows or loves another

A part of shiny wet 
Like blood the rain fell 
Black down on the street 

And kissed his feet she fell 
Her head an inch away from heaven 
And her face pressed tight 
And all around the night sang out 
Like cockatoos

""I'll never say those things to you again""

The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you and fame isn't everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams

The blindness of happiness

Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
Suddenly
A movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light

I left that basement burning

I saw it at sea
It lit up the fish like rain
And rained then down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater

Hey hey hey!!!
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey!!!
Yes I'm jumping like a jumping jack
Dancing screaming itching squealing fevered
Feeling hot hot hot!!!

The third time I saw lightening strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around
And left me for dead

The Cure,"[Repeat: x2]
Oh I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go
My party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs
Pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and
Stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both us knew
How the ending would be,

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round
And it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart
And I'll feed it to anyone
Crying for sympathy
Crocodiles cry for the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to heaven
Than ever feel whole again

I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs
Pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and
Stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew
How the end always is

Her arms are wicked and her legs are long

Do you hope to make her see you fool ? 
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel ?

I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning and I never went back

The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater and I never went back

It hit me in bed
It threw me around and then left me for dead
For a second that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire and I never went back

Move slowly through drowning waves

It's a perfect day to throw back your head 
And kiss it all goodbye 

It's a perfect day for getting old 
Forgetting all your worries 
Life 
And everything that makes you cry 
Let's get happy! 
It's a perfect day for dreams come true 
For thinking big 
And doing anything you want to do 
Let's get happy! 

But it's much too late you say 
For doing this now 
We should have done it then 
Well it just goes to show 
How wrong you can be 
And how you really should know 
That it's never too late 
To get up and go 

Kick out the gloom 
Kick out the blues 
Tear out the pages with all the bad news 
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls 
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors 
Oh just burn down the house! 
Burn down the street! 
Turn everything red and the dream is complete

Going up in fire 
It's a perfect day to throw back your head 
And kiss it all goodbye",Doing the Unstuck,1993
The Cure,"I think I've reached that point 
Where giving up and going on 
Are both the same dead end to me 
Are both the same old song 
I think I've reached that point 
Where every wish has come true 
And tired disguised oblivion 
Is everything I do 

Please stop loving me 
Please stop loving me 
I am none of these things 

I think I've reached that point 
Where all the things you have to say 
And hopes for something more from me 
Are just games to pass the time away 

Please stop loving me 
Please stop loving me 
I am none of these things 

I think I've reached that point 
Where every word that you write 
Of every blood dark sea 
And every soul black night 
And every dream you dream me in 
And every perfect free from sin 
And burning eyes 
And hearts on fire 
Are just the same old song 

Please stop loving me 
Please stop loving me 
I am none of these things 
I am none of these things 

I am none of these things",End,1993
The Cure,"Every time we do this
I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave
It's all for her
I know this can't be wrong I say
(and I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong
Right here with you
Right here with you...
And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try
Put your hands in the sky
Surrender
Remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye

I've never been so
Colorfully-see-through-head before
I've never been so
Wonderfully-me-you-want-some-more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone
A secret kiss
And don't go home
Don't go away
Don't let this end
Please stay
Not just for today

Never never never never never let me go she says
Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days
But suddenly she slows
And looks down at my breaking face
Why do you cry? what did I say?
But it's just rain I smile
Brushing my tears away

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry?
Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something
We will always want?

Why why why are you letting me go? she says
I feel you pulling back
I feel you changing shape
And just as I'm breaking free
She hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky
Surrenders it all

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried for you
It's always the same
Wake up in the rain
Head in pain
Hung in shame
A different name
Same old game
Love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again",From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,1993
The Cure,"Doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo 

Let me take your hand 
I'm shaking like milk 
Turning 
Turning blue 
All over the windows and the floors 
Fires outside in the sky 
Look as perfect as cats 
The two of us 
Together again 
But it's just the same 
A stupid game 

But I don't care if you don't 
And I don't feel if you don't 
And I don't want it if you don't 
And I won't say it 
If you won't say it first 

You think you're tired now 
But wait until three 
Laughing at the Christmas lights 
You remember from December 
All of this then back again 
Another girl 
Another name 
Stay alive but stay the same 
It's just the same 
A stupid game 

But I don't care if you don't 
And I don't feel if you don't 
And I don't want it if you don't

If you won't say it first 

You can't even see now 
So you ask me the way 
You wonder if it's real

I really think I should've gone to bed tonight but
Just one drink 
And there're some people to meet you 
I think that you'll like them 
I have to say we do 
And I promise in less than an hour we will honestly go 
Now why don't I just get you another 
While you just say hello
Yeah just say hello

So I'm clutching it tight 
Another glass in my hand 
And my mouth and the smiles 
Moving up as I stand up 
Too close and too wide 
And the smiles are too bright 
And I breathe in too deep 
And my head's getting light 
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer 
And I'm starting to sway 
And the hands on all my shoulders don't have names 
And they won't go away 
So here I go 
Here I go again

Falling into strangers 
And it's only just eleven 
And I'm staring like a child 
Until someone slips me heaven 
And I take it on my knees 
Just like a thousand times before 
And I get transfixed 
That fixed 
And I'm just looking at the floor 
Just looking at the floor 
Yeah I look at the floor 

And I'm starting to laugh 
Like an animal in pain 
And I've got blood on my hands 
And I've got hands in my brain 
And the first short retch 
Leaves me gasping for more 
And I stagger over screaming 
On my way to the floor 
And I'm back on my back 
With the lights and the lies in my eyes 
And the colour and the music's too loud 
And my head's all the wrong size 
So here I go 
Here I go again

Yeah I laugh and I jump 
And I sing and I laugh 
And I dance and I laugh 
And I laugh and I laugh 
And I can't seem to think 
Where this is 
Who I am 
Why I'm keeping this going 
Keep pouring it out 
Keep pouring it down 
And the way the rain comes down hard 
That's the way I feel inside

I can't take it anymore 
This it I've become 
This is it like I get 
When my life's going numb 
I just keep moving my mouth 
I just keep moving my feet 
I say I'm loving you to death 
Like I'm losing my breath 
And all the smiles that I wear 
And all the games that I play 
And all the drinks that I mix 
And I drink until I'm sick 
And all the faces that I make 
And all the shapes that I throw 
And all the people I meet 
And all the words that I know 
Makes me sick to the heart 
Oh I feel so tired

The Cure,"She follows me down to the sound of the sea
Slips to the sand and stares up at me
""is this how it happens? is this how it feels?
Is this how a star falls?
Is this how a star falls?""

The night turns as I try to explain
Irresistible attraction and orbital plane
""or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame?""
She brushes my face with her smile
""forget about stars for a while""
As she melts

Meanwhile millions of miles away in space
The incoming comet brushes Jupiter's face
And disappears away with barely a trace

""was that it? was that the Jupiter show?
Kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for, you know""
Pulling away, she stands up slow
And round her the night turns
Round her the night turns

Yeah, that was it
That was the Jupiter crash
Drawn too close and gone in a flash
Just a few bruises in the region of the splash

She left to the sound of the sea
She just drifted away from me

I'm so happy I could scream!
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you
It's perfect

I almost can't believe that it's for real

I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile
And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again?
I know we should!!!

The sun is up
I'm so fizzy I could burst!
You wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow! It feels so big it almost hurts!

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more?
I know we should!!!
Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this

He doesn't want to think
Doesn't want to feel
Doesn't want to know what's going on
Says there's nothing he can do will change anything
He doesn't want to know what's going wrong

One that stops him feeling at all
He's in love with a drug
Forget everyone

Anymore...

Yeah this is how it ends
After all this time
Everything just fades away
Worn-out and empty and all alone
With nothing left to say
Oh it's all too big to make a difference
It's all too wrong to make it right
Yeah everything is too unfair
Everything too much to bear
He doesn't have the strength left for the fight
Says all he wants is the drug
The one that makes him numb
The one that stops him feeling at all
He just wants to take the drug
Forget everyone
He doesn't want to care anymore

We've got to love them all

I'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss

So round and round and round and round and round we go!
Hanging on every shape they throw
It's strange the way we can't say no
Until we love them all

And smoke and choke and point and poke
And gag on countless lines
How much we love them all!

And I really don't know why we do it like this

I'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss

""Lost in admiration - happy birthday - I'm forever yours - Blossom""
Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies
I smiled, surprised at how when flickered through
The wings flew by spelled out my name

Six months went by, the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft, blood, smooth flowing hand
""Please try to understand: I have to see you, have to feel you
Tell you all the ways I need you; yours forever in love...""

Strange attraction spreads it's wings
It varies but the smallest things
You never know how anything will change
Strange attraction spreads it's wings
And alters but the smallest things
You never know how anything will fade

The year grew old, incessantly she wrote to me
She'd started smoking poetry!
I laughed in recognition of a favorite phrase
She'd pulled me in
I answered her
A Christmas card, in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet

Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
""Can I use some of your lipstick?""
It was perfect, so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms

[Chorus]

So alone into the cold; new year without another word from her
I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise, but this time nothing was the same

""I'm sorry - blame infatuation - blame imagination
I was sure you'd be the one, but I was wrong
It seems reality destroys our dreams - I won't forget you - Blossom""

Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more

The Cure,"I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel

Remembering
You standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering
You running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

Remembering
You fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering
You how you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world

Than to never feel the breaking apart

The Cure,"It started with a dedication
Lost in admiration happy birthday I'm forever yours blossom
Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies
I smiled surprised at how when flickered through
The wings flew by spelled out my name

Six months went by the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft blood smooth flowing hand
Please try to understand I have to see you have to feel you 
Tell you all the ways I need you yours forever in love

Strange attraction spreads it's wings
And alters but the smallest things
You never know how anything will fade

The year grew old incessantly she wrote to me
She'd started smoking poetry
I laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase
She'd pulled me in
I answered her
A Christmas card in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet

Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
Can I use some of your lipstick?
It was perfect so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms

Strange attraction spreads it's wings
It varies but the smallest things
You never know how anything will change
Strange attraction spreads it's wings
And alters but the smallest things
You never know how anything will fade

So alone into the cold new year without another word from her
I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same

I'm sorry blame infatuation blame imagination 
I was sure you'd be the one but I was wrong 
It seems reality destroys our dreams I won't forget you blossom
Faded red inside a tiny book of old goodbyes

How many times can I talk this way and wish, if only

Keep on aching the same heartbreak

The Cure,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you and fame isn't everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory

In the eyes of the ghost again
Down on my knees
And my hands in the air again

Pushing my face in the memory of you again

Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you

Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone

Feeling him gnawing my heart away

It's the same old game
Only fun with two ""

Leaves me open mouthed and still
Foolishly arrange tomorrow
The way I always will

Christabel trips
And grips my hand
But never to be saved 
For a second I understand
And I fall with her

Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before I left it all behind

I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned but I just couldn't get free
I opened my eyes, I still couldn't see
But I could feel her, China white girl

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey, oh

Ooh, that was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm and the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like
Like her scent used to fill up the night

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey

Just look at me now, just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
Looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway

Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream

The Cure,"""Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,"" she said
""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said
And threw her arms around my neck

Show me how you do it and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow

""Why are you so far away?"", she said
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes and found myself alone, alone

Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven

I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore

I remember one girl standing, one was sitting on the ground
One was holding me up, the other pulling me down
And I couldn't decide which one was real
Because there wasn't a sound, like I was pregnant again

You whispered dreams that would all come true

We were so in love
Up next to you so fucked and high
Under winter moon it made me cry
Whispering dreams on silver sand

We were so in love
The happiest night
Yeah the happiest night I had
But winter moon and silver sand
This perfect night in another land
Whispering dreams so scared and high
We have to keep this night alive
Whispered dreams so fucked and high
It's hard to hold this night inside
Yeah and every summer's sun I want again
And every winter's moon I want the same 
My happiest day and my happiest night

Up than low

If I never hear your name again, it's all the same to me

And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

You never care for secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament, somethin' for your pride
Always runnin', never carin', that's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time were all ya had to give

And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

The story's in the past with nothin' to recall
I've got my life to live and I don't need you at all
The roller-coaster ride we took is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears, that's all I'm gonna spend

And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

Oh, oh, oh, I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball",Red Rubber Ball,1989

But it won't be the one you want it to be
I think it?s funny how we don't get storms around here anymore
And the rain, when it comes, it tastes like nothing

I want you to remember me
For things I never did
'Cause no one in this world deserves
To see my happiness

I know what it?s supposed to be like to be young
But it is not the way I thought it would be

To distort and destroy any clarity and what's more

I want you to give back to me
The child I never was
'Cause I believed what I was told
Like everybody does

Let it fall down from the sky
And leave this world behind

Down by your side, I saw that you
Were fading, that you were leaving

Failing heart and take away the fear

Taking a walk along the river
And I saw him
Together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her
Made me shiver
Cause he always used to 
Look at me that way
And I thought
Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he
Likes to play

[Chorus]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and
You're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're
In paradise
And one day you'll
Find out he
Wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angel eyes

Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought
I could never live without him
And I wonder
Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back
All the pain
How can I forget that name

Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you",For Emily,2006

Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was forced out
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow
Oh my heart, Oh my heart shies from the sorrow""

Well I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or should I lie with death, my bride?

How you've stopped needing me,

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string

The D.O.C.,"High energy flowin' with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor
You should never underestimate the fashion
I hold for the stage whether I'm coolin' or thrashin''
Clockin' the concoction created by me
When read you read E = the D.O. to the C.
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals an artist that won't' be worn, what is that Dre?
It's the formula

It's like a message that only I could understand
But those who want to comprehend will again
Be in the midst of the brother
Unlike another in any way
'Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential
Me gettin' hype 'cause Dre rockin' the instrumental
Nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
See I don't Fess, I mean I'm like fresh if not the freshest
When I'm expressin' my thoughts on
Vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
Hooked because I cook when I pick up a pen
And begin, in the end it's dope, that's 'cause I want to win
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals the DOC, what is it Dre?
Yo, that's the formula

Keepin' it dope as long as I can like imagine
Makin' each record that I do better than the last one
Take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
Release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
Rhythmic American poetry
Shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
I'm the D. into the O. and the O. into the C. and the C. into the period
Suckers are fearing' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn

so don't' lie and try to front like someone said this

The D.O.C.,"[Dr. Dre]
Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect and we gonna kick it off a little some this like this
We got my mella yella boy on the drums, We got Stan ""the Guitar Man""
Dropping the rhythm. We got LA Dre on the keyboard and I want the whole
Posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
Alright, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this motherfucker , run it

[Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it'll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it

[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing

An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by

Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack

Especially if you're popping bullshit
Put the E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale

Yea, that shit was funky, last but not least is the motherfucking D.O.C.
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

[The D.O.C.]
Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom

The D.O.C.,"Together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
So um, let the bass go

Nah, it's got to go a little lower than that, Dre, drop it!
Nah, it's gotta go even lower than that, you know why?  (Why?)

You've been denied, although you've tried
So I've been a ving to make you fall like a tide
No disappointment, cause my beat will sooth like an ointment
Suckers with static approach and get rolled and smoked like a joint
Phlegm ignites the flame, I mean I burn like a lighter
Roll with the hip-hop groove cause I'm a writer
The hero of great, take a stand and we'll see
Eat in chronological order starting with me
A rap introduction, the suckers distruction
Yeah, are all involved when I started conducting
The lyrics are the maximum, I stated for facts in them
Chumps never try to break knowing I'd wax them
Murder in the first degree
Occurs only when dealing with the D-O to the see
I'm like a whirlwind pyramid, and I'm letting you know
I get ill when I hear the bass go

Yeah, that's the sound and you know it's down
But you know why? (Why's that?)

Cause I've been around, and you've heard the sound
Of the D.O.C. and the new style that I've found
It's quite unorthodox, but still bass and
Enough to make you dance, so I picked up the pace and
Let it ride like a cyclist
And see it show in the end that I'm the mightiest
And I'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
The beat and the cut to this rhyme
Do a show, and I'm good to like a G-O
Never getting skeezed, I mean it's like an N-O
Happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
So I let your ear cold hear when the bass go

Drop that bass (Aight, bet)

I don't want to (stop), cause if I do you might lose it
I made this record for you to jam, so use it
Kill the treble, pump the bass and then
Send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
Roll by, booming like a nuke bomb
I know there's pressure on your ears, but stay calm
After you pass, though, you better turn it down some
Or else you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
Success realize on the individual
I feel successful when receiving the residual
But as for you, you all should know
When I say ""Let's get hype"" I'm letting the bass go

Now that's the way it should be done
I know that's on the one, and that is fun

To see a sucker standing weary
And girlies on the tip standing near me
The bass was the topic so I dropped it
Added some dop lyrics and then I dropped it
On track 24 in a machine
To make you move on the hip-hop scene
Cued up Dre, and I knew that he would know
That on the one, I would let the bass go
Because a dope jam is what I gotta make
I make it rattle cause you love it when it vibrates
The D-O and to the see
Must cause pleasure when showing yo my abilities
To inject on the set mass enjoyment
This is to insure definite employment
When I hit town, yo you'll know
Crowds will roar, and you'll hear the bass go

Yeah, let the bass go

To
The new world

I'd like to make a small dedication tonight to the bitches of the world
Now to make this understood, I'm gonna explain somethin' to you
(biatch!)
Check this out
Bitch!
To be a bitch, you don't necessarily have to have a pussy in your pants
(True indeed, true indeed)
In fact
Most, if not all, of the bitches I know (That's right)

Don't make no sense to these muthafuckas
Dumb ass muthafuckas
Now to make it real clear I'm gonna explain it to ya in a story form
Like this here
Check this out

I remember the way it started
Once upon a time
When a nigga named Dre came, nigga got signed
Ruthless nigga, everything is all good
You the shit, 'cause you rollin' wit' some Boyz-N-the-Hood
No One Can Do it Better, see, 'cause I'm an M-D
And when I fuck it up, you give me 25 G's
Eazy-E said, ""Yeah, oh yeah!""
So I took it
Forget the paperwork
The money made me overlook it

I rose up quick from the pit I was in
450 0300 Benz
Nothin' but ends, money bought friends
Got me in a cross ?
Now everything's lost
This is when I found out
""Look at this shit!""
You is slippin'
You ain't gonna believe what that nigga did
""My shit fucked up, Dre, you need to look""
""I ain't trippin', yo, I think your little homie, he a crook""

The spot got shook, it was hell below
Is that the future shock?
Hell, no, it's Death Row
I was all in because of the begin
Think they would see
Yo, we all gon' win
So ""The Chronic"" was upon us, the music awards
But I was still broke at the crib when they toured
The album soared and I got bored
With niggas talkin' shit, they came upon a ?

Ain't that a bitch?

I coulda been the star dude
Or maybe I shoulda stabbed out like Ice Cube
But what about your Dogg?
Who? Snoop? We was tight
I hung around, we'd get together when he'd write
In the Pound, that's the way it come to ?
When it's goin' down, niggas is in whatever
I went outside for a minute and came back
Niggas was talkin' crazy like they wanted me to rap
So I did somethin' from the old LP
""Damn! That's that shit!""
""That's what a nigga want to see""

Visit the Windy City and ?
Rock over 17,000 G's
I recognized game
The shit was kinda funny
Fucked-up voice shit, nigga make money
He came back and here comes the glory
And this is the way I'm gonna end this story

I was only 19
Lookin' for a dream
From what I put out
I never got a fuckin' thing
This and the wreck was the fucked-up part
It's just a little somethin' about some real heart

Ain't that kept undercover another one cause I got
Six got hung by the beast
Looking for the golden feet
With shackles
Lookin' to Jackyls, Greenpeace
To a ring to fill
Death come quicker when you shoot to kill
Watchout!
But your merry, sleep with your gun
Show me the sign innocent one
The end might come
Now whatchya gonna do
Night
Be to cold
Who shall save the human race, none
Six thousand, erase, replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Here in by now, was so organized
Look for brotherhood
Made light the skies
Symbol of who arrives
Four thousand years, the past
Remember
Religion is better to to control your ass
Reflect
When the millennium connect
its so def freakin' right to meant to be elect
Reflect
Come face the order
Witness the immatical manslaughter
Now
Follow the master, supreme degree
The new world curve, now jet the 33
Thirteen levels above thee I see
Heel never to reveal the real keys
To the esoteric language
As you enter a brand new age of anguish
Pyramid
Police turn my niggaz into thieves
No matter, six thousand delete, repeat
Repeat X12
(Sirens, gunshots, breaking glass, screams, and laughing)
Momma I don't want to die
Mind crawl
Circle complete when they creep the cat claw
Alien, secret unto the ages
Be symbolic to the dead sea pages
Nights
History didn't
We forgettin from where the cocaine 
Brotherhood of the insane
Slay
Humanity you can not identify thyself
I sign and pray
Sign, hand over forehead
Countersign  pyramid, eagle wing spread,hey
Luciferian, totalitarian, socialistic, twistic mind
So when they bail
Holy blood, holy grail
Historically, they don't want a nigga to see
Trilateral begun kurk
Political murdering, do the gun work
Chasin'
To replace the hell
Into a jail cell
Society, don't want you in they clientel
No matter, six thousand we blood runnin'
'95's the beginning, watchout it's comin'

America is now under martial law
Stay in your home
Do not attempt contact with loved ones
insurance agents, or attorneys
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur
Stay in your homes
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp, after work
Anyone caught outside the gates of their
subdivision sectors after curfew, will be shot
Remain calm
Do not panic
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by
to collect urine samples in the morning
Anyone caught interferring with the collection
of urine samples will be shot
Stay in your homes
Remain calm
The number one enemy of progress is question
National security is more important than individual will
All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor

Obey all orders without question
Be happy

It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
But that's the life of a G, I guess 
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest 
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs 
Getting a rep as a young hog 
It ain't nothing like the street life 
Betta be strapped wit yo clip, 'cause ain't no fist fight 
So I guess I gots ta handle mine 
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street

Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me

Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what)

Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right

She doesn't need me
She says that she won't see me
Well I can watch her so I'm standing at the back of the line
To see her body at two minutes at a time

I'll tell you now man well it ain't easy
She's never coming home
I spent my nights alone

Down at the peepshow!
My baby's dancing tonight
Just down at the peepshow!
She'll be shaking for some other guy

I'm one of many
She's all I've got
Well I take my money
And push it in the slot
When she starts moving then I don't feel so alone
I can almost imagine
That were back at home!

I'll tell you now man now it ain't easy
Always trying to catch and run
She won't come home
Oh No she won't come home!

She's shaking that ass!
Shaking that ass!
She's shaking that ass!
Shaking that ass!
She's shaking that ass!
Shaking that ass!

Down at the peepshow!
(I wanna see you baby shaking that ass)
My baby's dancing tonight
(I wanna see you baby shaking that ass)
Just down at the peepshow! [x2]

Nothing ever came to me free

Well I've been working everyday of the week

(Hey you!) I get every little thing that I wanted
(Hey you!) I get whatever I need

[Chorus]
Don't put your trust in nobody
You can't trust nobody but yourself
(No no no)

Everybody's gonna keep on pushing
Cause everybody's got something to hide
But you know when push comes to shoving
Your brothers gonna leave you behind

They got smiles they don't mind using
While their sharpening the knife for your back

I can lose my sight, it ain't worth seeing you
Reversed in light, you seem to split in two

Beneath the age warped, innocent and left intact
The urge of age turn, reconcile, take it back
My eyes are cursed and darting
And the shots ring out the same

Ring the bell if you're hungry
You've started fighting for less
Fill a hole with your money
It's all second best

Break through the force of nature
Drape blinds on all your answers
You'll never fall unless we tell you to

They concentrate, they take what's mine
Lost they move like fractured ghosts
To empty heads in empty lines

Trapped in frames of empty films
A war is flat, in frames they kill
Light will char and edits cut
They broadcast stare, they know they must

Faded raids before they fold
Into themselves it's done I'm told
Acting last repeats to last
And beats you back when credits rolled

Build yourself a fame through fire
And douse it out when you require
List your age on lilac page
Strength in a crawl back to the stage

When it's obvious they're not scared of us
They will drag you back to cold
All film burnt at source, much too fast of course
They will drag you back for more

When your wish runs out they will make you doubt

It sounds so distasteful, more than what you're fighting for
More flights of stairs derailed, your ascent it falls so slow
Your body and love impaled on the spikes you left below

Grief turned to currency just like midas touched it black
Like rage in its infancy, you're afraid it might turn back
A flag slashed by injured nights in a fist outside your past
Waves only eclipsed by fright in its glory at half-mast

You can't beat denial, it's the murder of your past
A line drawn hard and broken down
To lie outside your grasp

I fooled you by way of greed
But it opened up your eyes
Too deep down in your hallowed nerves
But it came as no surprise

Your silent servant dragged abyss across the ground
To wallow sleeplessly on everything you found
Afraid lasts a lifetime and it crosses paths with mine
Lost fades its energy, in the end we both but shrine

So ends disgraceful, ride me back to where I rain
Controlled and quarantined, impure, distressed and stained

Your faith so restless as you turn to talk to me

All the clothes loose like shredded hair
Dream escapes to a closet class war

Suffocating in a sadists' prayer
Flaming horses on a fading landscape
Break the surface but there is no air

Throws a brick through the city gates
Backfires on his wordless offspring

Drives his mind like an engine room
Cogs turning like a flawed stage whisper

Cleans his blade with dreams he froze

Perfect precise and a slave to the master's demands

This situation is out of my hands
I got a new prayer for a new plan
Come in and get me
This situation is out of my hands
I am the crossbearer in the crosshairs
Come in and get me
Come in and get me
Come in and get me

Didn't the dogs get the scent
Do you kids get the sense
I've come undone

Do you kids get the sense

The Damning Well,"Out of control of a history untold 
It begins with the father of sin 
I walk alone in the garden of stones 
I turn into the monster within 
Life is too long for me 
Life is too wrong for me 

'Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
Nothing Times

I lose control as the story unfolds
I have been like a knife to bare skin
I walk alone like a king with no throne
I burn up from the monster within
Life is too long for me
Life is too wrong for me

'Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human
I realize
That I miss being human 
Nothing Times

I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces
'Cause I have come to need this
I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces 
'Cause I have come to need this
Shell

'Cause there's something that
I realize
That I miss being human
'Cause there's something that
I realize
That I miss being human
I teach lies
That I miss being human
I teach lies
That I miss being human
I teach lies",Awakening,2003
