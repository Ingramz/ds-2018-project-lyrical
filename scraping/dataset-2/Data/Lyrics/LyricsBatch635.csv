Lulu Santos,"Não existiria som
Se não houvesse o silêncio
Não haveria luz
Se não fosse a escuridão
A vida é mesmo assim
Dia e noite, não e sim

Cada voz que canta o amor não diz
Tudo o que quer dizer
Tudo o que cala fala
Mais alto ao coração
Silenciosamente eu te falo com paixão

Eu te amo calado
Como quem ouve uma sinfonia
De silêncios e de luz
Nós somos medo e desejo
Somos feitos de silêncio e som
Tem certas coisas que eu não sei dizer

A vida é mesmo assim
Dia e noite, não e sim

Cada voz que tanto amou não diz
Tudo o que quer dizer
Tudo o que cala fala
Mais alto ao coração
Silenciosamente eu te falo com paixão

Eu te amo calado
Como quem ouve uma sinfonia
De silêncios e de luz
Nós somos medo e desejo
Somos feitos de silêncio e som
Tem certas coisas que eu não sei dizer",Certas Cousas,1996
Lulu Santos,"Moça do bando da lua 
Chega em casa, põe fogo na brasa 
E vai pra rua 
Namoradeira 
Menina bonita 
Volta e meia 
Vira uma sereia selenita

Scarlet, lua serenata 
Colombina, ela só combina 
Com a prata, com a luz do sol

É minguante, 
Num quarto crescente 
De baixo do lençol 
Lua nova 
Blue moon 
Vira rosa 
E fica toda cheia",Scarlet Moon,1996
Lulu Santos,"Você não pode me estranhar
Só porque eu falei a verdade
Pior seria te iludir o tempo todo
Não vejo vantagem

Você precisa entender meu jeito de te querer
Pode até não ser como você imaginou
Mas eu te quero, eu te venero
Eu te adoro, só não vou te enganar

Porque eu sou sincero
Sou sincero
Baby eu sou sincero
Sou sincero

Você não pode me enganar
Só porque eu falei a verdade
Pior seria te estranhar o tempo todo

Porque eu sou sincero
Baby eu sou sincero
Sou sincero
Sou sincero",Sincero,1996
Lulu Santos,"Eu vejo a vida melhor no futuro
Eu vejo isso por cima de um muro
De hipocrisia que insiste em nos rodear

Eu vejo a vida mais clara e farta
Repleta de toda satisfação
Que se tem direito do firmamento ao chão

Eu quero crer no amor numa boa
Que isso valha pra qualquer pessoa
Que realizar a força que tem uma paixão

Eu vejo um novo começo de era
De gente fina, elegante e sincera
Com habilidade
Pra dizer mais sim do que não, não, não

Hoje o tempo voa, amor
Escorre pelas mãos
Mesmo sem se sentir
Não há tempo que volte, amor
Vamos viver tudo que há pra viver
Vamos nos permitir

Lulu Santos,"Quero te conquistar
Um pouco mais e mais
A cada dia
Satisfazer tua vontade
Também me sacia

Vem me hipnotizar
No alto andar, luar
Me acaricia
Posso morrer de amor
Que ninguém desconfia

Lulu Santos,"Devo evitar teus olhos
Mas não pude reagir
Fico à vontade, então
Acho que é bobagem

A mania de fingir
Negando a intenção (Faça não)
Quando um certo alguém

Cruzou o teu caminho
E te mudou a direção
Chego a ficar sem jeito
Mas não deixo de seguir
A tua aparição

Quando um certo alguém
Desperta o sentimento
É melhor não resistir

E se entregar
Me dê a mão, vem ser a minha estrela
Complicação tão fácil de entender
Vamos dançar, luzir a madrugada

Inspiração pra tudo que eu viver

Quando um certo alguém

Cruzou o teu caminho
É melhor não resistir

E se entregar
Me dê a mão, vem ser a minha estrela
Complicação tão fácil de entender
Vamos dançar, luzir a madrugada

Inspiração pra tudo que eu viver
Que eu viver uou uou

Quando um certo alguém
Desperta o sentimento
É melhor não resistir

E se entregar",Um Certo Alguém,1996

Então vamos fazer tudo outra vez 

Do começo bem devagar 
Que é pra coisa não desandar

Lulu Santos,"Eu achei que o amor fosse mole 
Algo assim feito um requeijão 
Mas a verdade dura, me derrubou no chão 
Desde então eu sofro feito um cão 

Mas agora eu sei, e eu não acredito 
Me cansei de ter ilusão, hoje eu sei 
Só acredito no que já está na minha mão 

Eu achei que a vida fosse bela 
Bela como as damas D'Avignon 
Mas nesse tempo feio quase nada é bom 
Existe bem mais gente sem que com 

Mas agora eu sei, e eu não acredito

Lulu Santos,"Como vai você hoje em dia?
Espero que esteja tudo bem
Eu ando tentando ver o lado zen
O que é que nos ensinam
Nossos mesmos velhos males

Aonde você tem andado?
Sempre me perguntam por você
Eu tô indo a vida
Com a determinação de um trem
Como um faminto em um prato de comida

Pois sempre houve espinhos
Nas rosas de qualquer jardim
E se há calor no ninho
Há pedras no caminho
E ainda assim é belo

Como vai você hoje em dia?
Espero que esteja tudo ok
Eu ando tentando ver o lado zen

Lulu Santos,"Eu gosto tanto de você
Que até prefiro esconder
Deixo assim ficar
Subentendido

Como uma idéia que existe na cabeça
E não tem a menor obrigação de acontecer

Eu acho tão bonito isso
De ser abstrato baby
A beleza é mesmo tão fugaz

É uma idéia que existe na cabeça
E não tem a menor pretensão de acontecer

Pode até parecer fraqueza
Pois que seja fraqueza então
A alegria que me dá
Isso vai sem eu dizer

Se amanhã não for nada disso
Caberá só a mim esquecer
O que eu ganho, o que eu perco
Ninguém precisa saber

Eu gosto tanto de você

Lulu Santos,"Ainda vai levar um tempo
Pra fechar o que feriu por dentro
Natural que seja assim
Tanto pra você quanto pra mim

Pra gente poder dar risada

Com passos de formiga

Lulu Santos,"Eu não sou diferente de ninguém
Quase todo mundo faz assim
Eu me viro bem melhor
Quando tá mais pra bom que pra ruim

Não quero causar impacto
Nem tampouco sensação
O que eu digo é muito exato
E o que cabe na canção

Qualquer um que ouve entende
Não precisa explicação
E se for pensar um pouco
Vai me dar toda razão

A senhora, a senhorita e também o cidadão
Todo mundo que se preza
Nega fogo não

Eu não sei viver sem ter carinho
É a minha condição
Eu não sei viver preso ou fugindo",Condição,2000

Demolirá
Toda certeza vã
Não sobrará
Pedra sobre pedra

Não nos custa insistir
Na questão do desejo

Vem sentar aqui comigo
Sou seu pai, sou seu amigo
Quero te aconselhar
Olhe na parede, aquele prego, ali pregado;
Ele sabe o meu passado, mas eu quero te contar:

Naquele prego
Eu já pendurei meu laço
O arreio do Picasso
Cavalo de estimação
E um par de esporas
Que custou muito dinheiro
E o chapéu de boiadeiro
Que eu lidava no sertão
Naquele prego
Pendurei muito cansaço
Muito suor do mormaço
E poeira do estradão
E quantas vezes
Minha mágoa pendurei
Sentimentos eu guardei
Pra não magoar teu coração

De agora em diante
Vou tirar dele meu laço
O arreio do Picasso
E as esporas vou guardar
Naquele prego
Pendure uma sacola
Cheia de livros da escola
E vontade de estudar
Quando amanhã
Você estiver aqui sentado
Lembrando nosso passado
Olhando o prego pioneiro
Quero que seja
Um doutor bem afamado
E diga sempre em alto brado
Sou filho de um boiadeiro!",História de Um Prego,2008

Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me

This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it

Lulu Weiss,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

I've grown to love you in such a special way
In my heart always
I've never felt a love, baby, not this way
Promise me, don't change

So I wondered if you ever, ever, ever dreamed that this could be you
Right here in this place
And I wondered if you ever, ever, ever dreamed that this could be true
Yes, it's no mistake

Did you imagine we would ever end up like this?
Did you imagine I would ever long for your kiss?
Did you imagine we would ever end up like this?
Did you imagine I would ever long for your kiss?

Just wanna be with you, baby, you hold me
And you change my sadness, I'm happy, not lonely
I just wanna be with you, baby, you hold me
And you change my sadness, I'm happy, not lonely

Lumidee,"When I met you at first I was frontin'
Time passed damn I'm in somethin'
We got caught up and I fell real hard
To tell you the truth I ain't never go this far
Now we chillin' and we laughin
We playin house in the crib. Who'd imagine?
A lot of people wanna see us apart and at the time I ain't never take that shit to heart

'cause we was too tough they ain't budgin us
They can throw it your way you ain't ___ up
But as the years go on
You doin' shit to make me wonder 
Are we still that strong?


Chorus:
Well he told me 
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely
And I just can't figure that one
No I just can't figure that one
Well he told me 
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely
And I just can't figure that one
No I just can't figure that one


Nowadays I'm always flippin' bout nothin
It's my fault it's lookin' like somethin'
Your new habit's turnin off ya phone
And your bull ___ stories when you come back home
Is it all in my mind?
Am I dumb? Love is blind
'cause I keep dealin' wit the same ___ all the time
As soon as you get caught in the mix, it ain't you it's ya man and you ain't doin' shit
It's just the little things you do that make it seem to me like you ain't true
But I'm tired of stressin' ya
But if it ain't true I just want the best from ya



Chorus:
Well he told me 
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely
And I just can't figure that one
No I just can't figure that one
Well he told me 
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely
And I just can't figure that one
No I just can't figure that one


If I'm what you want my love
Then baby be true 'cause I'm true to you
And we'll make it through
Soldiers play your part for me




Chorus:
Well he told me 
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely

Big Snoop D.O. double G with the home girl, Lumidee
And we in it for the money, in it for the money
Hey, cheese

I wake up every morning gotta get it 'cause
I'm addicted to money 'cause, see, money is like a drug
It's the root of all evil, my people told me what it does
If you stick to it, get to it, do it now, live it up

Been in the hood since Job Noby stopped me
Talkin' 'bout what they heard how they got me
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
With the same dudes now throwin' dirt on my name

But it ain't nothin' to a girl like me
Love me or hate me I'ma still do me
And I've been through the ups and the downs
And no matter what they say, look, the girl's still around

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

Don't get it twisted and don't even try to knock me
'Cause I ain't one to ever be cocky
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
Broke and naive but a lot of shit changed

Yes, I've learned how to play it, I can show and prove
And if you ain't makin' money you ain't makin' moves
Yes, I have been through the ups and the downs
Wait, you're gettin' phased 'cause I'm goin' all rounds

I'm only in it for the money

Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

Up to the ceiling, I'm feelin' like a million away from two billion
And I ain't stopped dealin', but am still in the game, still hearin' my name
Half a million dollar car, quarter million dollar chain
Money, and I'll tell you tonight
Money changes your life from a butter to a steak knife

Used to take life for granted
Now am known as one of the richest rappers
In the whole motherfuckin' planet
Ya dig it, I'm in it for the money

I make it rain, I let it snow
That twenty plus seven more zeros
Add it up, ya livin' wrong, better get right
Stop being broke and get ya monies tight

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

For the money, I'm in it for the money
Ain't no joke, I know you're tired bein' broke
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Never see me smilin', any things damn funny

It's for the money, it's only for the money
He wants the fame and she wants the honey, yeah
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Me and Lumidee, shit, we in it for the money, no

I'm only in it for the money

Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard
I can't rise about it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My mama and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm Crossin' my fingers
And countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard
I can't rise about it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck
And dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

The perfect post production
You were made from alien hands
The lust of every man

Elevated evolution
The problem and solution
You taught the serpent how to dance
You're the siren of romance

And I say, hey, hey, the end is coming
Why would you leave me wanting?
Bombs are raining from the sky
But even when the world's on fire
I won't stop to watch it burning
I can't bear to take my eyes off you

The poison and the potion
You string me out like winter lights
You kill me every time

Why would you leave me wanting?
Bombs are raining from the sky

I won't stop to watch it burning

To a military band

And I will always be the one who stays

Meine kleine Stadt ist jetzt auf den Beinen
Sie kann nicht mehr schlafen und fängt an zu schreien
Mein altes Leben ruft mir nach
Ey Luna bleib doch noch 'n bisschen da (Ey)
Doch ich bin jetzt ständig on the run
Ich bin in Köln, München, oder Amsterdam
I’m on the run, on the run, on the run
Mein Telefon klingelt doch ich geh' nicht ran

Ich weiß die Lichter laufen schon warm
Ich fühl' das Mikrofon in meiner Hand
Irgendwas da draußen wartet schon
Und es zehrt mich aus dem Nebel
Auf meinen Thron

Es geht bis zu den Wolken Baby
Ich mach mich auf und davon
Von hier oben kann ich runter sehen
Hier bin ich angekommen
Ich war noch nie so klar
Ich war noch nie so da
Es geht bis zu den Wolken Baby
Ich mach mich auf und davon

Es hat sich hier nicht viel verändert
Es ist so wies immer war
Ich lieb' meine Stadt und ich lieb' den Hafen
Kenn' jeden Platz und jede Straße beim Namen
Und ich zieh' durch den Ort den ich schon lange kenn'
Hier lernte ich Laufen, Sprechen, Küssen und Singen
Ich mach die Augen zu und atme ein
Und dann muss ich wieder los denn es wird jetzt Zeit

Nein, ich werd' heut nicht mehr umdrehn'
Ich weiß doch wo ich hingeh'
Ich weiß noch finde ich mein Glück
Ich drehe mich nicht um
Nein, ich werd' jetzt nicht zurücksehen

Oh uh

Die Gefühle fahren Achterbahn
Ich spür' den kalten Schweiß auf meiner Haut
Und mein Herz fängt an zu rasen
Doch das ist nur das Lampenfieber
Wenn die Bühne bebt
Ich kann schon die Posaunen hören
Und ich weiß jetzt wo es hingeht

Heats up coffee that's been sitting there

Che non riesco a non riesco a far tornare, ma che vorrei
E invece non esisti più, sei come un incubo
Che viene ogni notte a turbare i sogni miei

E invece in fondo ci sei tu, sei come un livido

I see your hidden agenda
Had to send me shit, but I'm killing the sender
Run it on my shit, then I left it to render
And nigga I'm the shit, came up quick like I'm Slender
Man, I'm on a high one
Counting all my worries (Oh no, I've got none)
Counting all my monies (Oh wait, you want some) suck one
I don't give a shit and I'm not wearing your tees
I've got my old girls down here, chilling on knees
I've got my new girls down here, willing to please
I'm on the next ting, quick thing, wired up, cheque please
Still I’m still a young thing, ain't that something?
Living life like I never thought I could
With my team here around and everything is all good

In blurry visions everyday

Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I grew up poor, everyday I wore that same dirty Yankee cap
Low over my eyes, I didn't wanna talk to no-one, I was angry fast
Forward to a month ago I was in the New Era office
And they let me take what I like imagine that
I guess things do change, couldn't afford family holidays
Growing up, but today I've been on two planes
Never begged it, why you have to go making a scene
My bars go over heads like Michelangelo painting a ceiling
Life's like a motion picture, we’re blinded by Smoke ‘n’ Mirrors
And lies that were told to give a desire to go and buy
All the things we that can't afford, we're convinced that we need
I just want to be happy and not live in the street
They fucking with my chakra, I'm just tryna do me
You idolizing guys that lie and hide behind their jewelry
Their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
Living like there's no tomorrow, I know every moment's borrowed
Like a walls of sorrow (Smoke 'n' mirrors)

Blind me from the way

I don't wanna get lost on this long road
I've been looking for something hoping it unfolds
But I see a lot of smoke in the air
And I've been looking in the mirror but the reflection is unknown
Am I going mad, losing my mind?
I tell myself I'm doing just fine too many times
But man are dead weight, my boy said, ""Get your head straight""
I'm like ""Brothe', you can say that again""
But I never would've imagined this chain of events
I remember when I just wanted some fame in the ends
Trying to do it all the same as my friends
And it's funny how it switched up, maybe sing your next song
Why we tryna see clear? Looking through the mist, but
I don't wanna be here, when I get a glimpse up

Fall asleep, pretty one, warm on my shoulder,
I must tramp on through the winter night dreary,
While the snow falls on me colder and colder.

Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure,
Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother,
Dreaming of pretty things, dreaming of pleasure.","Crying, My Little One",2010
Lúnasa,"I saw a ship a-sailing,
A-sailing on the sea,
And it was full of pretty things
For baby and for me.

There were sweetmeats in the cabin,
And apples in the hold,
The sails were made of silk,
And the masts were made of gold.

The four-and-twenty sailors
That stood between the decks,
Were four-and-twenty white mice,
With chains about their necks.

The captain was a duck,
With a packet on his back,
And when the ship began to move,
The captain cried, ""Alas, alack!""

I saw a ship a-sailing,
A-sailing on the sea,
And it was full of pretty things
For baby and for me.",I Saw a Ship A-Sailing,2010
Lúnasa,"A capital ship for an ocean trip
Was ""The Walloping Window Blind,""
No gale that blew dismayed her crew
Or troubled the captain's mind.
The man at the wheel was taught to feel
Contempt for the wildest blow,
And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared,
That he'd been in his bunk below.

The boatswain's mate was very sedate,
Yet fond of amusement, too,
And he played hop-scotch with the starboard watch
While the captain tickled the crew.
And the gunner we had was apparently mad,
For he sat on the after-rail,
And fired salutes with the captain's boots,
In the teeth of the booming gale.

The captain sat in a commodore's hat,
And dined, in a royal way,
On toasted pigs and pickles and figs
And gummery bread, each day.

But the rest of us ate from an odious plate,
For the food that was given the crew
Was a number of tons of hot-cross buns,
Chopped up with sugar and glue.

And we all felt ill as mariners will,
On a diet that's cheap and rude,
And the deck shook when we dipped the cook
In a tub of his gruesome food.
Then nautical pride we laid aside,
And we cast the vessel ashore
On the Gulliby Isles, where the Poohpooh smiles,
And the Anagazanders roar.

Composed of sand was that favored land,
And trimmed with cinnamon straws,
And pink and blue was the pleasing hue
Of the Tickletoeteaser's claws.

And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge
And shot at the whistling bee,
And the Binnacle-bats wore water-proof hats
As they danced in the sounding sea.

On rubagub bark, from dawn to dark,
We fed, till we all had grown
Uncommonly shrunk when a Chinese junk
Came by from the torriby zone.

She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care,
And we cheerily put to sea,
And we left the crew of the junk to chew
The bark of the rubagub tree.",The Walloping Window Blind,2010
Lúnasa,"I had a silver penny
And an apricot tree
And I said to the sailor
On the white quay

Sailor O sailor
Will you bring me
If I give you my penny
And my apricot tree

'A fez from Algeria
An Arab drum to beat
A little gilt sword
And a parakeet?'

And he smiled and he kissed me
As strong as death
And I saw his red tongue
And I felt his sweet breath

You may keep your penny
And your apricot tree
And I'll bring your presents
Back from sea.'

O the ship dipped down
On the rim of the sky
And I waited while three
Long summers went by

Then one steel morning
On the white quay
I saw a grey ship
Come in from sea

Slowly she came
Across the bay
For her flashing rigging
Was shot away

All round her wake
The seabirds cried
And flew in and out
Of the hole in her side

Slowly she came
In the path of the sun
And I heard the sound
Of a distant gun

And a stranger came running
Up to me
From the deck of the ship
And he said, said he

O are you the boy
Who would wait on the quay
With the silver penny
And the apricot tree?

I've a plum-coloured fez
And a drum for thee
And a sword and a parakeet
From over the sea.'

With bold red hair?

On the bright air?

I stay stuck like Chuck, choppin' it up on the homey's faulty 
Flossy with the flava, major haters trying to solve me 
Cross me 
In the game you get your life took 

We be hurtin' 
Puttin' in work 
Like a bg can't see me like a right hook 
To the brain too much game for you to match about my scratch bitch 

Nigga don't need no practice 
Show me the loot and I'm at this 
Gat up under the mattress 
One up in the chamber 

Real gang banger 
Ain't no stranger to this danger 
For dangler, fade ya like the major Cali chronic 
Niggas that test the west gonna rest in peace and that's a promise 

Got 'em hooked like phonics 
Shakin' 'em up like I'm Mystic 
Wicked when I'm with this stay in motion like a stick shift 
I rip this 

Burn 'em up like syphillis 
Let 'em know I'm locced, leavin' 'em broke like it was Christmas 
Stompin' in my steel toes, always down to bo-guard 
We hoo-ride on tight tracks got sacks like a nose guard 

That capital I-N-D-O got me faded, affiliated with ballers and thugs 
Movin drugs to make a profit, pockets swollen
Rollin' blunts up fatter than your dick 
Sick approach, puttin' in work with my folks Lunasicc

I got no time for you bustas I'm born and raised to be a hustla 
We creep in the night puttin' it down on you suckas 
Murder motherfuckers 
And when I come I'm a dump 

Jump out the back of the van 
With the mack like man where the funk, punk? 
I keeps it poppin 
Non-stoppin droppin' shit like a seagull 

Blastin', without no mask kill 'em up fast when I mash my Reagle 
Flashin' quicker than faggots at a disco club 
They bow down, when I come around 'cause I'm oh so tough 
Shoelaces tied so ain't no reason for me to trip 

When provoked I choke a bitch until she gimme that grip 
Murder I wrote, like movies make the whole crowd scream 
Runnin' through the back door bustin' like I'm jackin' for cream 
Nigga duck down 

I'm 'bout to pound like some cake 
Psycho, schizo, to the nymphos can my nine get ate? 
Nutty like the professor 
Pullin' out weed like dressers 

Make 'em all fall 
When it call for laws I change like draws 
Into a killa 
Fuck the world I'm out to get my scrilla 

Don't give a fuck about bitches, don't give a fuck about niggas 
My trigga pulls like pimps, with they hoes on the strip 
'Bout this money, ain't nothin' funny when I'm clockin' that grip 
Bag 'em like they some groceries 

You niggas don't know me 
Tight like blue Nikes, I'm kickin' this funky shit like Shinobi 
Might go do life for bustin' I'm bringin' ya death 
Kill at will, bitch, with the steel until there ain't nothin' left

Faut te rabattre quand mes rabzas, négros sont khabat
A fond dans l'autre sens de la droiture
Mes khos des pointures, toujours à l'avant dans la voiture
Je te fais saigner quand t'as pas tes règles
Je veux qu'on m'enterre avec une barrette
J'ai le son qui dépouille comme les Touaregs
J'ai pas de pareil et ceux qui essaient me font marrer
Je suis déjà arrivé, ils ont pas démarré
On est foutus, une clique de barbares
On va tous y passer, comme le pape sans gilet pare-balles
J'ai le vice et quand je vise c'est droit dans ton terma
Toujours chaud, je vis dans un thermos
On veut te baiser dès que tu montes
Et je me demande si c'est truqué comme la Coupe du Monde
Donc j'emmerde tout le monde
Ici y’a rien de tendre, rien à comprendre
Les Hauts-de-Seine en Cosa Nostra
Putain c'est grave comment on cause à notre âge
Y'a pas de feeling, et si tu veux tester mes égals
On te baise ta race comme si c'est légal

J'ai 6 millions de raisons de perdre la mienne
Le système développe trop de pièges
Les gars racistes occupent trop de sièges
Immigré depuis le gène, faut que je maintienne
Sur mon droit chemin, marche de travers
Vivant, mais comme à quatre coudées sous terre
On s'en sort car soudés comme l'a voulu le Mahdi au Soudan
Dédicacé à mes nègres et mes crouilles sous écrou
Prisonnier du ghetto du corps, et pire celui de l'esprit
Chaque jour qu'on respire est une épreuve pour nous
Mon trajet, une véritable tragédie
Dans les ténèbres à chercher la lumière faut surtout pas que je dévie
Ici-bas, je connais rien de l'avenir
Vu que j'ai pas la prophétie délivrée à la tribu de Lévi

Chaque fois ça pète et je reconstruis
On est les plus divisés du monde
C'est pour mes gars, civilisés ou non
Mes troupes sont mobilisées
Je vire dans le rouge mais je dois rester civilisé

C'est pour mes gars, civilisés ou non
Mes troupes sont mobilisées
Je vire dans le rouge mais je dois rester civilisé

Je voulais être seul mais trop tard j'étais déjà né
Pour tout baiser, pour être champion du monde comme Tidiani
Enfance insalubre, comme un foetus avec un calibre
Et les putains qui crachent leur salive
Mais moi j'ai le sourire comme à l'enterrement d'un flic
Voir ma clique, retour en Afrique sans rapatriement
Et pour me traquer sur le ciment
Oublient leur jour du seigneur
Ces fils de putains taffent le dimanche
Fais pas de blabla, chante pas de balades
Je reste dans le vrai même si faut que je graillle, je te jure wallaye
Et si je dois canner, naturellement ou d'une balle dans le dos
Quand je partirai faudra que je sois dans le Dîne

Improvise parmi les démons et les anges
Compose textes après textes pendant mon éveil et mes songes
Ecriture sacrée comme le Gange et ses crues
Inévitable comme la femme et ses menstrues
De quoi je te parle?
De nos rimes et de nos instrus
Des vérités que nos lèvres articulent
Surveille le bien, le mal jusqu'à sa moindre particule
Vu que le diable manipule, voudrait le monopole
L'humanité divisée, pôle Sud contre Nord
Civilisé je me dois d'être
Cultive la science semée par les ancêtres
Homme Kemite, original donc normal que nombreux imitent
Tout comme les galaxies j'ai mes propres limites
Même les étoiles s'éteignent, t'es pas éternel
Bonhomme réfléchis une minute
Orienté vers Mecqua, atteste que Dieu est unique
Vers lui le retour, aussi sûr qu'additionner 6, 6, 7 donne 19
Additionner 6, 6, 7 donne 19

Lunch Money,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop

Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top

Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine

You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar

Hop in the low, let's jump
What the fuck you runnin' yo' mouth for?
It's Coleone bitch, I'm ready so what you gon' do?
I'm higher than your bedroom, 'bout to stick you like this tattoo
Make a move nigga, you opened them death threats
Better run and hide with your bitch, that'll see your best bet
I'm a psycho, aim for the head when the lead blow
One less nigga, one less stanky hoe
Now who can fuck with me?
The type of nigga that'll grab the gun and say you stuck with me
Got these niggaz up on the run, my bitch bust quickly
So spread out, I'm coming through - wit a pump
Mistakin' my size you best prepare for the funk
Cause I'm a hostile nigga, got my shit cocked
A false move might get yo' punk ass popped

Bitch you want some huh? Oh, you crazy as hell
They call me Coleone, and I can ???? my ??????

I remember back in the days we used to live so right
Not word about a thang just ridin my bike
Clicked up with the homies at the school house ballin
After dark I hear my teacher at the front door callin
I ain't leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
Walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
Those were the dayz dead now things did change
Takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
Tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
Get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
Leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
Give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse

Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons

About the old school days
When we was rippin verses 
Strictly for the love of the game

And all the sessions were packed

Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream 
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet 
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until we meet on the other side 
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

If I could decide which heart to love, I swear; it would be yours

This time you're here to tell me
You're in love- that's nothing new
I could consult you, like I always did before
But this time it's something else:
It hurts you to stay with me, and I donâ??t want to lose you

Hoy mi corazon late por tu said 
Es mejor decir adios, no volvernos a ver 
Terminar con esto que tanto duele 
Tu me heristes muy cruel 
Pero como ves, la soledad te ataca why quieres volver 
Hoy no creo en tu amor, ya dejame 
Que en tu juego no voy a caer 

Es mejor dejarnos why ya no mas buscarnos 
Deja de estar llamando porque ya no quiero intentarlo

Perdistes la oportunidad

El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Lo nuestro se arruino, no trates de arreglarlo 
El amor que te di no supistes valorizarlo 
Perdistes se te hizo tarde 
El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Ya se acabo el amor, ya no hay solucion ( yeahhh)

Vamos, así es que ellas mueven las poleas

Y vroom vroom, ella se come la brea 
Llega a la disco y todo el mundo la lokea

Eso, beso con que se come con queso 
Esto es un proceso, suelta de eso pa' los presos 
Tú sabes, doña, como mi voz tiene peso 
El perro quiere un hueso, avanza dame un beso 
Fuimos, sácala en la parta que tu eres tremenda loca

El tiempo que separa con calma los colores

Sin ti no puedes parar y tu cuerpo ya quiere actuar 
Falta poco lo de tu mirar que me quiere perriar 
Es tu sonrisa lo puedo notar, con tu baile tan sensual 
Es tu mirada al bailar, suéltate y pégate mas 

Te vi bailar, mujer lucete, demuéstrame lo que puedes hacer 
Para saber como ahí te atrapo muy cerca de la pared 
Te vi bailar, mujer apriétame, enloqueceme perra
Para saber que yo soy ese hombre que tu quieres tener 

Tu bailar es un arte 
Muy sensual cuando lo haces 
Todos te quieren pero tu me sigues 
Soy quien mas de ti recibe

If, if, if, if, if...
If you ever change your mind
Only turn back the hands of time
Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't want to see you cry
I don't want to see you cry
Can't take place its not to fair
I know for you it's much to bear
When you're drowning in despair
Just know I'll always be right there
Right there, right there, right there...
(Verme...) No, no, don't want no more
Maybe you're gonna regret it someday
You feel that you'd be better off
But it's still your loss
And you know it, take it
Take it as a loss
You'll regret, the very thing
When you just up and left
You can act you're better off
But it's still your loss
You'll regret it, regret, regret

No será fácil olvidarte de mí
Yo te hice feliz, lo sabes, lady
_________,baby, te quiero a ti
No pienses que yo iré por ti
Now you're calling, you're feeling lonely
Hoy sentirás lo que yo sentía por ti
Se que hay un dolor why un vacío muy dentro de ti
Pero fue lo que decidiste, lady
Que quieres de mí, recuerda de que al fin
Arrepentida vuelves tú aquí
Necesitas verme why regresas por mí
Se que te mueres por mi...
No puedes olvidarme...
Estoy en tu piel...
Lo sabes bien...
No quieres perder...
Ni un minuto sin mí ser...
Arrepentida estas, no finjas mas ...
Verme no quieres mas, why tal vez...
Te arrepentirás, yo se...
Serás tu quien perderás...
Serás tú, tú lo sabes...
Verme no quieres mas, why tal vez...
Te arrepentirás, yo se...
Serás tu quien perderás...
Serás tú, tú lo sabes...

Everybody need to take time to reflect
Take time to put things in prespect
Soon as you realize
And start to regret

and get a better hope
and get a better hope

No la cambio por na' ahora

¿Quién es? El que te pone a vibrar
¿Quién es? El que te pone a pensar
¿Quién es? Al que tú quieres besar
¿Quién es? The boss, Daddy

Ay, nuestro amor se acabo
Por mi búscate otro hombre
Otro que te vuelva loca
Loca, loca, vete

Ay, nuestro amor se acabo
Por mi búscate otro hombre
Otro que te vuelva loca
Loca, loca, vete

(¡Oiga, sinceramente!)
La relación se cancela, te di gabela
Sabiendo como soy me gritas why me celas
A esa avena no le tiro más canela
Yo sigo en el party gastando la suela

Porque en la novela esta es la parte que tu vuelas
Why yo controlo la manivela
¿Oye, tú haces dieta, porque modelas?
Why yo sigo aquí comiendo arroz con habichuelas

why ya llevo un año sin ella en el puro jangueo
Ya yo no la veo, solo ron why bureo
Why si es cuestión de perreo, perreo dale un paseo
Hoy es noche de entierro, chula, siente mi deseo

Bienvenidos a otro capitulo!
De la historia del reggaeton!
""Los Benjamins""!
Nosotros somos el dream team!

Socio, ando por la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡Se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de Playe'?
Cuando no había radio, video ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como Jack the Ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
A John Kennedy le dieron, papi, con to' y escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en BET, TRL por MTV, ¡please!
Pa' acá tú no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en sus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday
El pasado, presente y futuro way
Si esto fuera la NBA
Fuera Dr. J, Jordan y Lebron James

Abran paso al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor Morera controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra del cabo en madera
El enviado como Neo que anda aborreci'o
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con los corta-frío
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Manso como Titi Chagua por el área de Caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""Agua!""
(¡El junte de los guerreros!)
(¡""Los Benjamins""!)

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa' meterte con la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata
Quieres sentir la barroca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el mothafucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te vo'a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el Cerro
Mamahierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, muchas vidas he priva'o
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber
Quien va a tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblenme claro y pa'l duelo
Llego cortés, el de Morera y Veguilla, el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Si en pifia los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su ""brutality""
Ustedes to's me pagan ""royalties""
'tan to's leídos no me hablen de ""loyalty""
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi ""versatility""
Y no pueden con mi ""productivity""
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una ""opportunity""
Pues, compárense con mis ""capacity""
Sigan mascando lo que Luny hace, el ""beat""
Y Don te batea un ""hit""

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces ensorroso
El mío queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero
Papi, yo soy el favorito de los pirateros
Yo soy aquel que te mata
Y pa' hablarte claro, papi
El favorito de tu gata
De los dones y las doñitas
El mas que suena en las ""scooter"" y las motoritas
(¡Arcángel, pa'!)
(¡No te copies, papi!)

Hoy mi peine caracol se va de gira
Hasta que no tumbe un par pa' atrás no vira
Mi pana, coja la orilla, póngase las zapatillas
Porque hoy vas a correr mas de una milla

Luny Tunes,"Esta noche no entregare el corazón
No confundiré el amor con la pasión
No quiero saber de engaños que me hacen sentir desilusionada
Luego de entregarme abandonada

No estaré loca pérdida por un hombre
Que no tiene nada para darme solo un duro corazón
Money money, si no hay money money no?
No tendrás ni mi número de teléfono

Pague con lágrimas el dolor
Y en mí, solo el pobre corazón
Y hoy se, que no quiero hablar de amor
Sin hacerme llorar, anyway

Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar
Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar
Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar?
Y esta noche la sacare para bailarte

Como la música vuela
Llevamos en mis sentimientos en un viaje
Y tú sientes como mi corazón se congela
Y se pone fríamente calculado cuando tu?

Siente como la música vuela
Llevamos en mis sentimientos en un viaje
Y tú sientes como mi corazón se congela
Y se pone fríamente calculado cuando tu?

Quieres hacerme llorar
Y ya no voy a llorar
Quieres hacerme llorar
Y ya no voy a llorar, any way

Esta noche tomare tu corazón
Busco sacarlo de la oscura prisión
Luego de bailar contigo yo te haré sentir
Tanto amor? que olvidaras la pena y yo?

Ten cuidado digo que te quiero
Que me muero por tenerte a mi lado
Bailando este reggaeton
Honey honey dance until we see the moon
Bailemos con la música de luny tunes

Que pague con lágrimas el dolor
Y en mí, solo el pobre corazón
Baila y solo abre tu corazón
Y yo no te haré llorar, anyway

Yo no te haré llorar
Yo no te haré llorar
Yo no te haré llorar
Yo no te haré llorar
Yo no te haré llorar
Yo no te haré llora

Estaba loco por verte
Deseoso por tenerte
Quiero volver a su lado (Más Flow 3)
No importa que diga la gente
Le juro señora nunca le falle  (W, Yandel, El Rey Don Omar)
(El mejor de todos los tiempos DY)

Decían que por ser menor que usted
Yo no la quería
Que no era amor solo interés
Y aquí estoy todavía
Y aunque pase el tiempo lo sabes bien
Que soy aquel chico que te hizo sentir mujer
Siendo mayor que yo Usted (Luny Tunes Más Flow 3)

Llego papá
Don

Señora usted me gusta tanto igual que el primer día
Bienvenida a la tercera dinastía
Se juntaron los que to el mundo quería
Para cumplir toditas sus fantasías
Con esa experiencia que usted me ha conquistado
Me tiene loco, me tiene enamorado
Y esa cinturita como que no ha cambiado
Y esta noche la quiero tener
Allá en mi cama
Topar tu calenta'o, prendió en llamas
Que el ronque dure hasta las tres de la mañana
Yo forever papa, tú forever mama
Aye malvada, tu mente de perversa
Como acelera cuando pone la reversa
Y choca con el hunter cazando la presa
No baje el fronte vamo a matarnos

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me deje loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me deje loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar

Lunes a viernes tiene novio, pero el sábado lo deja
Aparece el domingo con la cara de pende
Ella se viste cara y el tipo se acompleja
El tiguere es su favorito me lo dijo en la oreja
Señora mía, saludable, rica, cero calorías
No has cambiado en nada tú sigues de reposteria
Quiero besarte de nuevo, me gustaria
Hay una sorpresa de Victoria, tú me la modelarías
Ese cuerpo no ha cambiado me tienes hipnotizado
Siempre fina, maquillado, tremendo calzado
Recordemos el pasado ya yo estoy desesperado
Completemos lo que no hemos terminado
Guille salvaje, de tinker bell el tatuaje
Cuando esta sola en su casa me llama pa que trabaje
La monto en mi viaje ella quiere cangrinaje
No tiene ropa interior debajo del traje

Decían que por ser menor que usted
Yo no la quería
Que no era amor solo interés
Y aquí estoy todavía
Y aunque pase el tiempo lo sabes bien
Que soy aquel chico que te hizo sentir mujer
Siendo mayor que yo Usted (okay)

El mejor de todos los tiempos
The GOAT (Daddy)
Fuimos

Y a mi me gusta la fruta madura que se deja comer
Cuando yo te pele ahi, ahi te voy a morder
Que bien tú te conservas haces que me sangre hierba
La mujer es como el vino y tú eres la mejor reserva
Quiere que le diga, quiere que le diga dale mami enseñame
Quiere que le diga que en la cama usted es la que sabe
Dame cariñito corazon, dame cariñito corazon
No hay hombre que la dome cuando ella aprieta

Ao ao me puse salvaje
Ao ao aguanta el voltaje
Ao ao sacúdeme ese motete
La llevo a casa y de suerte se lo bajo pa que respete

Me tiene enloquecido, estoy convencido
Que usted se va conmigo aunque me busque un lío
Yo no te obligo ma', si yo te sigo
Tranquila que de aqui nos vamos encendio

Yo sé que arrepentido no me quedare
Entre mis sabanas te encontrare
Sabes que soy el hombre, que más te conoce
Siendo tú mayor que yo

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me vuelve loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me deje loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar (fuimo)

Quiere que le diga, quiere que le diga
Dale mami enséñame
Quiere que le diga que en la cama usted es la que sabe
Dame cariñito corazón, dame cariñito corazón
No hay hombre que la dome cuando ella aprieta

Luomo,"I guess you turn me on,
When you're gone,
For me it didn't go wrong,
we just made another song.

Off getting it alone,
Never asking if for long,
It's just that the world ain't enough,
And it never was for the two of us.

Baby, it's okay.

I guess you made me warm,
When you do the hum,
Making everybody come,
Getting creative with your charm.

I tried to be all yours,
Over line ain't answering your calls,
Don't say it's false,
I'm only following my thoughts.

Baby it's okay,
We'll make it better,
Baby, I, I'll survive,
Without these women in my life.",Tessio,2000

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shunning while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his colour will be cured

With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say, that we ought to
Live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect

You ever feel like the pressure is
Too much to take, too much weight?
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In the dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen

Odds of making it were slim to none

I'm tired of them saying the dream you have
Doesn't exist, telling you you're worthless saying you should quit

Mumbling to yourself in the basement all day

My boys used to get it they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I knew 'em by heart like a brain in my chest
Then I took 'em to school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, ""Mr. Jaco?""
""Yes?""
""With all that knowledge, you ain't trying to college
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence?""

To all my homies out there grindin' (ya know what I'm saying)
Legally and Illegally
Ha
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
So, check it out

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact
First time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like this
Now we can end the story right here 
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea
He said it was somethin' so appealing
He couldn't fight the feelin'
Somethin' about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, since his first kickflip he landed
Uh
Labeled a misfit, abandoned
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea
When he said it's getting late in here
So ""I'm sorry young man there's no skating here""

[Chorus]
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way he roll just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, and Push, and Coast

Push down with the right, lift up with the left
Push down with both feet man, now land that shit fresh
We used to ride around just doin' that
With some used Airwalks and Billabong on my back
Happily because my mom couldn't afford it
When it came to Black validity, I guess they felt shorted
Identity crisis, they scrunched they facial
How we both black and our kid is biracial?
Okay, let me simplify the story yo
I was black but white in the middle like an Oreo
I skateboarded past all the shit I coulda been
I know my dead homies wish they was much gooder then
I mean gooder then, not cuz I'm better than
See, Airs got hooder man, blood got wetter than
I was just tryna bring it home and set a trend
But they would just yawn like it's Late Night for Letterman
I'm tryna tell 'em, it ain't no chance it's a fad
But they look at my Sadplant like a plant that was sad
These niggas count more grants than my dad
From all the cocaine in the grams of a bag
Skateboard P stand for skateboard past
All the bullshit that the devil's plans had
It grew up happy man, that plant wasn't sad
So I put it in Vanity Fair and the Zoo York ad
And I cooked it up to a crystallized dream
Take a puff, don't that taste like ice cream?
My record come out, the store calls your girl
Hate it or love it, I warthog the world
Yezzur

So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, and the way he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, so come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast

[Chorus]

Yea uh, yea, yea
Before he knew he had a crew
That weren't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks
They would Push, till they couldn't skate no more
Office building, Lobbies weren't safe no more
And it wasn't like they weren't getting chased no more
Just the freedom is better than breathing they said (they said)
And they escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out (they'd head)
To any place with stairs, any good grinds the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take them there
Till the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""

So don't be trying to steal my light because you don't know me, don't pretend to

Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give em coca-cola for their property
Give em gum, give em guns, get em young, give em fun

Lupe Fiasco,"He came back in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain laying on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smell the Hennessey from where his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just filling the casket up
Floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second-grade handwriting, simply read, I miss you
Suit-jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his men stuck a swisha
He had a notion as he lay there soaking
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open and he

Chasing the cool

Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it, working like a
Hmmm reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave, and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That had got him in the box, ringing Henney out his socks
He figured it was hours, because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder, so
With a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home, so he?

Damn that nigga stank, is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, was he shook, was it the shame?
Matter of fact, the only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and getting back in his lane, doing his thing
First he had to find something to sling
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
He walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked, and some little niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
They put it to his head and said, you're scared, ain't cha?

For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day

I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep 'em happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep 'em on autopilot cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin' on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try, not to step on the children,
The news camera's filmin', this walkin', project building
Now there's hoes selling hoes, like right around the toes
And the crack heads beg, at about the lower leg
There's crooked police, that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's car chase, going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest
I'm sitting in my room, as I'm looking out the face
Somethin' to write about
I still got some damage from fightin' the White House

We need a few more half naked women up in the pool
And hold this mac-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22's
And where's the champagne, we need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And know hold up your chain, slow motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud 'cause the baby's sleepin'
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreamin'
Me and my robot tip-toe round creepin'
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me

Through the good neighbourhoods and all of the woes in it
Exerted control in it

Bounce in the booth, spit it like Skoal in it
Putting my heart and my soul in it

He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not comin out the box he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
'Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
'Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
'Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all) He never lies
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin' them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin' them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
'Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all, anything at all)
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars",The Instrumental,2006
Lupe Fiasco,"Food and liquor stores rest on every corner
From 45th and State to the last standing hymn nuhana
J&J's, pale chicken, good finger licking
While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild and Lynnwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger
Meets the high stride of the youth searching for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get, high off that drum bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubbling over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry, the days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood
I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good

You know what it is
See, I got this philosophy right
I think the world, and everything in it
Is made up of a mix, of two things
You got your good, y'know, and your bad
You got your food, and your liquor
That's right, Chilly Chill!
You already know, it's a long time coming

Lupe Fiasco,"First got it when he was six didn't know any tricks
Matter fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp like this
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it couldn't understand it brand it
Since the first kick flip he landed
Labeled a misfit a bandit cucump cucump cucump
His neighbors couldn't stand it
So he was banished to the park started in the morning
Wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea when they said its getting late in here so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here

So he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled jus' a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me just a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast

My man got a little older became a better a roller
Yea no helmet hell he'll end up killing himself
Is what his momma said but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what was happening to him now
He said I would marry but I'm engaged to the aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two
She said bow I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now let me make one thing clear I don't need to ride yours I got mine right here
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Something odd in a apartment parking lot she said I don't normally take dates in here
Security came and said I'm sorry there's no skating here

So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they roll jus lovers in the twine with no place to go
So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me jus a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast

Before he knew he had a crew
There wasn't no punk in they spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push till they could skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
And the skate route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs any good grinds the world was theirs
And they four wheels will take them there until the cops came and said there's no skating here

So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they roll jus' rebels without a cause with no place to go
So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come roll with me jus' a rebel looking for a place to be
So just kick and push and coast","Kick, Push",2006
Lupe Fiasco,"Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
You know what it is, haha

Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read:
""A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy""
Wasn't lying tho, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
'Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The kunk-kakunk-kakunks now took him to the crib
A lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bid
But what was on his mind, and pushed him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids
Gets up to pump, so he

Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh

You see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings, would ride
Switch over the transition help her conquer it
Pays for mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit
Uh huh, and that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel the pain and a place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why, she

Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah

A traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Nod they heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch, and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, ""You thank for push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick""
Well I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you

Kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why you

Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look

And, 1st and 15 is just a sewing machine
So I, cut the pattern and I, sew in seams
And, button in this hustling then publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them and cuffing them is like
Ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that
A little big in the waist, Tupac it on the back
Call them Nu-vi's, O.G.'s covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
Look, how you think I got here?
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper, deliver like river
Content a little more thicker, slicker

Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish

Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was Do or Die
They was tired of being ""Po' Pimps,"" now for sure

I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants

Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's

Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move
Something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

Lust
Sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved
He just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them
But we hush if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real

They don't know how to feel

Ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free
Ain't a G, show you right

The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know
That's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel

Struggle
Another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low
Being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes
To try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes
Or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can
On the man up above you

That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop
Something they can feel

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
It's hard to get
In the car we sit
From the intro
She rolled down her window
Just in case I was a schitzo

So I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm
A lil more confident (Uh Huh)
And then we lose consciousness
She says ""that I've been waiting for you""
And I know you been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle
I been thinking of you
I told a fire breathing dragon ""he bet not harm me"" or he be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said ""see, too beautiful to let you sleep""

Relationship is just 30 minutes long
It's kinda heavy maybe a lil strong
""Go and take"" much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me outta the trillions of numbers that's in the world
Just leave me a few that lead to you
Won't be longing I see you in the morning

You don't girl you don't know about me
But you will, that's for sure
Let's start with an introduction!

Take a little sip with some conversation

What's it gonna take for some motivation?

Them other guys causing you pain?
I'll show you that I'm not the same
I swear to you I'm not the same, oooh

I've got this question I keep asking myself
Are you my cure for addiction?
Are you love's definition?
Or just bad for my health?

What we need is each other
Make our own little story
We could start it today

Lupe Fiasco,"If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Yea, uh
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you
Did you improve on the design
Did you do something new
Well your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you, you
The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you
You come to
And then it hit me
Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules
And two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer
And too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle
I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know

If you are what you say you are

Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'mma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'mma veer so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness, the windshield is menstrual/minstrel
The whole grill is roadkill, so trill and so sincere
Yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills, when a bloke in a trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost, so a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in a lear
She's fine and she's flying, I feel I'm flying by em
'Cause my mind's on cloud nine and in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the underground king
Who's also klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I sphinx like leon
Or lying/lion in the desert
I'm flying on pegasus, you're flying on the pheasant

And I ain't used my headrest yet

About the best-fed f-f jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and, excess depth
Even scuba steve would find it hard to breathe

See: now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic
That click when it's pushed and a wack-ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like: ""That's that heat!""

With a screwed-up hook that went ""stack that cheese""

Down baby-momma, who he really had to honor
Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda to
Drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
And buy everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

Grind, might feel like murder, but

They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it 2 times, say it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool

Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day yet listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hat
He's gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then could get a soccer ball

Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from

I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still to young

And in shimmer shades who looks half his age
About half the size of the flags they waved
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off dead soldier hang a little loose
With AK-47 that they shooting into heaven
Like they trying to kill the Jetsons
They struggle little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, avoided of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kids will come through and murder a whole town
And sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down

B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silence she don't approve of violent games
She leaves resume activity
Start and blew hearts, with poor harsh wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the purses of murder work load
I tell him he work for
CIA with A
And operative, I operate this game all day
I hold a controller connected to the soldier

And, everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, um

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the, house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed ya
In my dreams fore I went to sleep to lala land to count them sheep
I swear you're lookin' prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more
For better or, less or poor, or worth our weight in buried treasure
X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to ya
But Ian said: Aloha, and Harley said: Cheers
Julian said: Bonjour!, Big O was like: Yeah
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we goin' there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, Pursue your interests, cause even If
I'm ticket less, I'll be there, by your side
In your heart and, on your mind
So, as I taxi down another runway
I Gotcha, who loves you bay
Now bring it back, now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Yea, uh
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you
Did you improve on the design
Did you do something new
Well your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you, you
The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you
You come to
And then it hit me
Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules
And two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer
And too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle
I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know

That a sinners hide
You can get a ride
Just get in line
Hand by your heart
Like memorize
Ask God please
Could you energize?
Beam on up
To the Enterprise
From the inner-city
Or the winter-city
Where's Mini-mini?
Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's
Not a lot of hymns
Only one eye
Whole lot of them
Saw a cyclops
That's a eye clock
Like a Rolex
With a eye patch
See what I got
Matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow
Suicide watch
I'm just killin' time
Plus I'm insane
In a straight jacket
But it's Romanelli
I'm just gettin' back
For now it's kinda poor
Want to have things
Couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me
'cause I ain't got a mind
I'm from Ha--
I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine
But don't step here
Because it's unbear
That I didn't find
Nympho mo' top
Like a mohawk
I remember when
I was so not
It was no locks
Man I couldn't ball
I was so bald
Robocop
I was Mr. Clean
Now I'm Mr. T
But a different team
F & F rules
Call me F.I.
From the west side
And I'm underground
Pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)

Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black
(Black [x7])

And I'm feelin' good
Like a villain would
If he was doin' bad
Kill Superman
Tied to a log
Push into a saw
Take a little dog
Right through the fan
Enemy man
Like a dictionary
Like a definition
Like you never listen
Not the issue is it
But the deaf part
Break it in half
Like an intermission
You'll see then
What I mean then
Or what I meant there
Doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it
Keep versin' it
'til it's permanent
Like pen-pal
Got an empire
I'm the emperor
Like the cat were
I'll be faster
Are you tryin' to ask her
Just slow me down
But I'm goin' down
Like a network
That's wolf-man
You got a full house
I got a full moon
Then I pull out
The ace-summer sleeve
Like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips
What they took now
What they put now
Gotta look down
And check your shoulder
'cause I'll be over
Like a boater
You got boaters
In your loafers
Put your foot down
While I ottoman
Or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand
See I elevate
L.A., Otis
My toes is
And my flow sick
Let it marinate
Try to break it down
Might take a while
All good though
I'll wait around
While you chase it down
That white rabbit
Down that long hole
Like paper towels (yeah homey)

Like a lighthouse
In the daytime
Make it lay down
Make it go to bed
Make it go to sleep
Like D-bo
Who needs jumpin' cred
That's a headlock
It's what I said I got
The whole game is
Like shooter box
Then the Shokazuki
If you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish

I get super low
I get super lost
I be super cool
Like a super boss
Say they super bad
But they super soft
Like super chicken
Without the super sauce
Let's step out
It's a rap now
Blow your candles
And your lamps out
When I pull up
You can pull the plug

It's a black out

Lupe Fiasco,"The coolest nigga, what

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

I love the Lord
But sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see; therefore, I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers
Of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene
The obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king
Together, she would make me cool
And we would both rule
Forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the reign stops and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven, set the fires in Hell
And I'll be

The coolest nigga, what

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

And so began our reign
The Trinity: Her and I, caine
No weather man could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard, umbrella, whatever
Put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon' need a sub til he does reply
And not one of Jared's; you think it's all arid
And e'eryt'ing's irie, another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger, Felix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class who might not pass
Rap record pressured to laugh at a life not fast
Can you feel it?
Is what I got asked
Do I love her?
Said, I don't know
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to the daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace with a solid gold key
Like the starter of a car, the opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea
I'm on my mission to be

The coolest nigga, what

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast-talking of the hustle

And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase

Well I herd like groups of cows
That all your enemies wanna shoot you down
They got AK-47's and a bunch of Mac-11's
Semi-automatic weapons that produce ka-pows
Word on the street is they all got heaters
They gon' hit you up, you ain't even gonna see it
You got a lot of money, I ain't tryin' to be funny
But they say where you goin', you ain't even gonna need it
I seen you ridin' round, shinin' with your fine round
Diamonds, pretty green eyed lady
Been on the sideline, plottin' while you prime time, poppin'
Hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect your bakery cause they comin' for your head
And there's a bounty on the chain that's hangin' from your neck, you see

I don't know what you been told in your ear
But I hear it's goin' down, somebody gotta (Die!)

Enemy to any nigga gettin' money on my honey
Man I heard Michael Young is the real clown here
Run upon a nigga from the back with a Mac
Gon' be strapped cause a nigga finna' squeeze off ten
Run upon this nigga 'lac, rat-a-tat-tat
Click-clack, where this nigga at? I needs in
Shit is going down if ever I see him
Rub a nigga out like Oxy 10
And keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet
To pay the cops so they can never box me in
That's what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Ridin' around polishin' this big pistol
I'mma catch him in the wind, pray the gun don't jam
So, until we meet again, nigga, it's cool

Ain't nobody with a shotty out plannin' to do a robbery
Itchin' to catch a body creepin'

Should I let the mini Mac or the shotgun hit him?
I been waitin' all day tryin' to spot this nigga
I can't let him get away I'mma pop this nigga, uh!

The Glocks in the box and the 9 on tuck
The bulletproof glass, the 40 in the stash
I pull the steering wheel and it pop all up

40 caliber stashed up in his dash box
Bulletproof windows you couldn't break 'em with a pad lock
Ak in the trunk, where the sounds bump
2 twin Glock 40's, and a 9 in his damn crotch

Man, we finna go up in this club, show a little love
Get a few drinks, holla at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some dro' in the air then go get some grub

And don't go nowhere, nigga wait for me

Hello darkness
You, you, you, you, you

All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend
That it's better than it's ever been

Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel
And it's well and it's fine and it's fine if it fell
And you couldn't find the story line
If you survive to retell, we are targets

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion

Said everything is going to be fine
Said everything is gonna be okay
Said just don't breathe the air

He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a foot hits the floor
His gift for not fighting another man's war

And if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore
On his face, they can put somebody else in his place and restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great

As gas fills the room and rockets destroy
Everything around him he stands to find himself surround
By thousands of soldiers that his once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye

Hello darkness

Salutations, Kanechiwa

Don't you know that I run this place
And I've begun this race
Must I rerun this pace
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this
But they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow
I am the one that they march with
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack-houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
Through the veinses of the fiends

One of the oldest, most ancientest things

I am the American dream
The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes

I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back

I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my trap
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food

The stars are aligned, and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving, and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of the rhymer, the pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her

Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores

From the antennas on the top of the shrines

Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then

Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those

Hey, little girl, don't cry, dry your eyes
I wrote this song for you
Now, it goes down

Can you imagine every world?
Every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things
They'd all get the same things

A little dough, a lot of love
With a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things

Huh, but down here the world is real
And it don't matter how you feel
Because, we don't get the same things
We don't get the same things

You got to work to stay alive
Forty hours, from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things

All my gangster friends, yeah
And all my skater friends
(What they want?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
We all want the same thing, yeah

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, now

And, I think about the way
All the politicians say
(What they saying, now?)
Say they want to change things
Say they want to change things

But every year, they take some more
And I don't know what it's for
Though, they never change things
(They don't change nothing)

But, if you want to make it stop, stop
Well, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes
Doing some different things, yeah

Get up out your bed, think outside your head
And you won't get the same things
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, now

And all my skater friends
(What they want, now?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
I said, we all want the same thing

We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
(What they doing, now?)
They all want the same thing
(What they want, now?)
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
(And what you say, what you say?)

Yeah, first say pie to the people
The have's and the have not's
Are we willing to give up all the hours
Just to make it all equal?

And make players out the mascots?
'Cause, right now, we don't see you
Like the Sasquatch
Unless, the root of all evil is what you have got

You're even more visible
If your hair is lots
If not banging from the beach
Then banish you to the sand box

With no lifeguard to come after you
No amount, you don't count, like Dracula
Your bound to drown like a Titanic passenger
Or, a Haitian refugee trafficker

They come and get you off the island
That you crashed into
They take a yacht
And send the slave ship back for you

Money matters, don't let it master you
Pressing on the answer
Till they give you what you're asking for
It's like that, yeah, it's like that

This is a message to
Remind you there's just one who calls love
Take them to church, Kevin

All my gangster friends

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker

Lupe Fiasco,"Dear Mr. President I
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?",Dear Mr. President,2009

Well ask me a question I tell you no lies
Cause there's nothing to hide my souls in my eyes
And I'm a head of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light

I begin and I master

But they sayin' what I'm seeing through is false like Ross
I can hear him through the wall like walk
This way they tryin' to dissuade my thoughts
I'm a slave to myself don't disobey my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst this array of different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the King of the south
Forgot that I was fat I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
And not wonders, the sky summers
So don't make me take off my stunners

And them there can't see us like hunters

Tryna keep my head above water
So I stayed out the navy
I, I, I made a promise to my girl
Said Imma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket
Took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace
And the first thing she said, was (it's too late!)

Now I don't need ya

fuckin' bitches
Nah
Nah nigga you're too late

My homie served ten years
It's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Ridin' around doing my thing
Is it too late to be tryin' to live dreams
Turn them all real
Reality is just a technicality
And so is being fake

I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long
And don't look too strong

Another second maybe second
Maybe third in the worst case

Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome

Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yea you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading, love
I can't win if it's me against me

Feels like I'm running out of soul
You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go

My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my own self I wonder if we still see a light
We was tight seeing lights
Speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted trying to fall asleep, losses at my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

To never go our separate ways
And spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin'
Playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits
Livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow
Can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room, the entry room, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is
I'm prepared to filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers shootin' out of you and me

You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go

Sometimes I feel like, the world is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This uzi weighs a ton, but I think I'm done!

The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat

The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at

I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip
Nine eleven building seven did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move you so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV all you see's a bunch of ""what the fucks""
Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news
And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'ma part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people

I can't take back the words I never said

Now you can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better than we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam!
And you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the Kush went
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gone make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects
Take 'em when the pains felt
Wash them down with diet soda
Killin' off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the World
Would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment
They can take your home away

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said

I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few

And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm that bitch
Something that's far above average""
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here

And because she's relatin' to herself, his most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

Now being the internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored

And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims

Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp

And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at bein' a bitch, like his mother
Momma never dressed like that, come out the house hot mess like that
Ass, titties, breasts like that, all out to impress like that

That’s cause you’re at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the front line with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away

You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armours and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

'Cause you've set me on fire
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah

Hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love

And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does

You ever see the inner depths of a man's soul?
Or ninja turtles pouring out of manholes
This is balance
Between a comic and a conscious, that's the challenge
Between the solitary and the conference that I examines
That I imagine was a figure
Would be the start of world peace and the transformation of niggas
Like the transubstantiation of liquor
But that's just turnin' them into blood
And we'll be right back where we was
Not a peace-sign, but a fascination with scissors
So I can cut
Myself off from the calculations of empress, empires, and the sinners
For advancement of human suffering
And other things trying to impede my publishing and editorials

Also I drive to stay alive and ride this over there

I'm Aries Spears on my Jay-Z shit
Affion on the Drake skit
Now how many more can I make with just one voice
They might call it fake shit
This some deep shit
It's my me impersonatin' we shit
Vicariously in every rap I speak with
I hope you're speakin' for me, if I'm ever speechless
Cause I'mma be you
Even though you're not here to be with
I hope I see these gangsters actin' like teachers
Wake up out they sleep, then they dream
And the world so Martin Luther King-less

On a jet plane with no fear for fallin'
But wishin' it never lands
Reminiscent of the dream time
Presently en route to the rhymes of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Please listen to the critics, pointless is the common passerby
Might as well not even exist, not even a bit
In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war

They shoplifted and stole
That just let me know they know
That was Lupe #1 now this version #4
And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the cove
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode
Now that boat is now my bed, desk, dressers and my drawers
Now that's a house of pain!
Plus I use nooses when I hang up all my clothes
Couldn't change up if I chose

Lupe Fiasco,"At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like,
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defence
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold

Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold

In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
In the back of his chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government

Ride around, you know what I'm saying
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
I used to tell him like ""yeah you alright""
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump

They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note, America's most

First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours 'cause ours is Kingdom Hall

Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it

So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jet ski
I got a catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu' all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line
Cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road
Dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super dog
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three mis, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest

You know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?

And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
We don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling
Bees just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seeds
Aloe, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be

And art what I draw
And ooh, what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then

Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type

So you respond lucid
That means you're non-foolish

You think you gon' lose it
But you don't bounce, you just bond to it
Like you Sean Con or Gorilla Glue-ish
With a blonde in your palm, King Kong in your coolness,
But they still tryna knock you off the roof kid

Change it into rainbows and rubics

Keep your sons out the slums and your daughters
Out of orgies

Whisper in your ear, I fear nothing that's before me
And always remember that you're royalty
From the line drawn until it's Porky
And everything that's in between
Make sure you cherish every scene
And put on the biggest show your adversaries ever seen

Like Gotham's under attack I will spot em, keep you from ever touching the mat
Be your Robin, bring that onomatopoeia
Down upon all your problems like ""zap! boom! bang!""
Cause all y'all my pals
I tribune through your tribulations, channel through your trials
Please God, help keep the value in my vows
A man of my words that Vanna turns around
And if your fortune turns, I never turn you down

Lupe Fiasco,"Now I can’t pledge allegiance to your flag
'Cause I can’t find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons’ abs
I’m telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab
Corruption is the swinger sittin’ high ridin’ dirty, drag racin’ into danger
And it’s so clean, pine trees smellin’ good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can’t shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down and tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don’t know what really matters anymore
'Cause I don’t know what really matters anymore

Many things, strangest things you ever seen
Oh, look at how they swing, would you look at how they swing?
Embedded they go, no eyelids gone low
Or gone by sundown, they're dodging 5-0

Now as I wander through the city goin’ mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doin’ bad
Then the separation from the truth is gettin’ vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummyin’ down of the importance of crowns we’ll never have
That’s why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be livin’ off your sad
Hatin’ on your happiness you hit ‘em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill ‘em off with glad
Hello evil, I’m back

Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes then
What they think are islands are much more in their size
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Other children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here. 
And for 500 years
Torture, Terror, Fear til they nearly disappear

My unforgivable youth

Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labour force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
""How can land be owned by another man. 
Warns one can not steal what was given as a gift. 
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish.""
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forest's were cleared, the factories were built
And our mistakes will be repeated 
by your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatment
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And you rushed to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die. In a world of hungry ghosts

As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
Appeared a 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. 
With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. 
They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. 
Kinda hard to figure out
And this must be the temple
This White House

How high I am and cold I is is the words that I just spoke, I did
I hope I did, 'cause sometimes I forget how much of a GOAT I is
Not a measuring of how dope I did, not an athlete, but the black sheep

Give me that late 80's early 90's old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that O.G.
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want it (Eh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past, what's up

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife like it's Christ-like
But nigga' I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school, what's up

Give me that old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling,
Giving you everything you want

Lupe Fiasco,"Now bring it out
Like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum, Tara at Sarah's wedding
Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't well then you wicked
Such is life
Odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark greys, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals
Vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your day, can I make what you say
What I wanna hear, cause I want you here
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like prolly in the eye
What of the chicken? what is it missin', is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And attention from its demise pulled all of the flavor from the fat
And made it flat and rather lifeless
Well there's a place that has a stunning [?]
And more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory?
Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
Or was it slippin' like permission am I trippin' like Phil
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real, is it real, is it real
Ha, hah!

How at the date can I make you my break
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised to the heavens make [?] for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

So glad you're back, but not glad at that you're glad
Where is the glamor in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The attended years slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

How are your chains, do they make you behave
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace down from heaven to memories [?]

Lupe Fiasco,"We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings

Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
As buried living and cherry picking
Every linen from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like nova scotia landscapes
Nerd game make mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word play playin' at the man's states
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world

And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to santa claus sleigh man
But reign like queens that reign over made man
And not queen like queen killer, rhapsody bohemian queen
But queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying ""hey""
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor
But now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops
And the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks
Then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack
On his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah

Then forge poetry like a young honory morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots
Who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbity
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a stacey dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding barbie doll
A river of women like a brazilian carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to mally mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at madri gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My reposition was black condition of activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications, stuck inside a apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion

Or are we more, than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and goyle chasing
And foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh!
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Unless you virgin mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest

As I perform a nerve storm
I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like kool-aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's oj the juiceman meets oj with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug
To judge who was, who drew blood

And, lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
Bucaraa roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerated shoes and the manual for contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat konami sign contract
Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spread an aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in chicano
Who’s the boss? if isn't alyssa milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the l
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of seal school
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
Take no viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes

Simple as a buddhist monk in a temple
Standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness

What if I said, love was a lie though
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Asking you where do I go
I and I keep high hope alive though
That loves not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you just got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, see the part, of your partner, that's the heart
If you die it's like apartheid
We can bring it back to the

No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah

On second thought leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's making sure it don't break into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape, and know things decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like 3D wage just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the street art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake?
When you was driving reckless, didn't pump these brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine running heart makes a soothing sound

Didn't appreciate now, bet you do

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)

And in the futuristic love will be reduced to physics

That use statistics, algorithms, and group logistics

Easily updated with few commitments
Can find it's way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you came back she wasn't there no more
She says, ""Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip to take a look at the stars around parsec 4""
And it was the most beautiful thing you both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love, so you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty, now the moments passing
It'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the end

Had a long money, minor do that action for them figures

Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said, ""Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million""

Said, ""I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like""
She said, ""My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life""
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah them niggas started bussin'
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said, ""Nigga hit the gas,"" went from zero to a hunnid

She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb
And ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard
And she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like ""What is this?""
And then we looked up and a light came down

Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lapdance
With a lit match in your left hand, and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush

Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?
Ayy fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this ho
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it

So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama

Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant
Some mamas just good for shoes
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy
Some mamas might not be cool
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
'Cause you don't make the rules
Really thought that you was doin' it today
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face
When you get home just tell her you're sorry
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass
Boy cut that shit off
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you
Said through the party and the problems
Gotta honor my mama
So that's what I'm tryna do

Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth

And I love my car
More than I love my heart

Now some might think their mama ain't perfect
She is
All in her face, better get in your place
You're one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it
She is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did

No material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath
Attain wisdom and refuse graph
And build upon what I built on
And wisely regulate time I do have
'Cause what is defeat?
But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste
So I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove the schism when the rules missing

Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships

Lupe Fiasco,"Adults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors
In fact, God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home 
And when they walk along the road, when they lie down, and when they get up
In other words, God is saying, ""Don't mess up the children""
African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other
To the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods
Are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide
Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost
Like teaching children to respect their elders and saying ""thank you"" or ""no thank you"" 
And other forms of common courtesy, God is saying, ""Don't mess up the children""",Don't Mess Up the Children (Interlude),2018

I heard you heard that I was fly so I'm Dumbo to my listeners
Gimmie them inches I make miles out them, bitches
Brew, listen, you couldn't do a mountain trial while in my intertube, Tour de Force
Tied so I am not the daddy
Had to move the club all by myself 'cause I ain't had no caddy, gladly
Didn't always have that cake but I always had a patty
Or at least a homegirl like Aesha from Cincinnati
Word to Ken and Kathy, who says that we can't be happy?
Sadly that it ain't no joke on that block
Let Laffy Taffy tried to trap me, dug out like a nappy snappy
Even Lassie attacked me, attacked me for grappling so I can get back to wrasslin' for the love
Because the foundation is my heart, that's my start
Play my part, make communications with my art
Give my DJ the Serato, got that chico from my vatos
Down in Chicos in El Paso, Tapatío on my tacos

Future, want it cuter than Karrueche Tran
Hula dance, not like Yokozuna in booty pants
On Hoover, I do the Dam
Or at least I'm tryin' in the hopes that I see some diamonds
And a boat and a piece of minin'
On a coast with a decent climate
Where dopes wanna seek refinement
And the Pros wanna keep it client
And the GOATS wanna see my rhymin'
For the dose of the secret science (yeah)
Went through the maze on the way to the stage at the pace of Amazing Grace (okay)
And the rays, and rays and the rays of the Sun wouldn't fade in the shade of the day

Not the nails salons but the nails that attack and 
A rusty razor blade to the face to clear your sins
Don't lie, they don't want that fate
No, they won't take that place
Yeah, gotta get mine from the love from below and above in the mud
And the mind of a kind, but I'm tryna relax but design all the time like floods

How bout them bullets ain't slow you up
You ain't really die and we watched you grow up
At 12 months you took your first steps
Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best
Your first breaths that we can call words
In your father's lap on November 23rd
They were ""live for me"", and he did for you
Flipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you
And this commitment from your father
Imparted a deep sense of value you'd forever harbor
And we were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter
And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter
But you were not a martyr, you lived

Find out, I was just a bad dream
Goodbye

At six, you started reading whole books
At seven, you knew how a brain looked
And could roughly describe, all the different regions
Could tell when we was sick and even knew the reason
The world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend
But you were hardly there, 'cause you was always leaving
Field museum planetarium aquarium
You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in
And those moments as a little girl
You realized it was a bigger world
Bigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago
You were bigger still wanted rims on your car, though
And big ass woofers in your car door
So you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks
Went to King where you were teased for being smart
Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art
You live forever

Find out, I was just a bad dream
Neither ever, nor never, goodbye
Neither ever, nor never, goodbye
Neither

At sixteen is when you got your scholarship
At twenty-two is when you got your doctorate
Even now it's kind of hard to believe
But your father taught you work hard, and achieve
And you complied, accepted by every medical school you applied
But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot
You replied: ""they need me in the hood"" and that's where you reside
Free clinic, nobody denied
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside
And saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands
Fading fast, but you knew she could survive
Did everything you could to keep this girl alive
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived
And in that moment, where you gave your help
I bet you didn't know that you saved yourself

Copper alloy bracelet forms were recognized 
And used as currency for transactions 
From the end of the 15th century to the mid 20th century
Their metal content varied from copper to brass
Most manilla were manufactured in England or France
And like trade beads, were used for trades with Africa
The local chiefs on the slave coast of West Africa traded 
Their human cargo for many different commodities and manilla was one of them
This manilla was manufactured in Birmingham between 1830 and 1850
Being shipped to Africa to be bardered for one slave, each manilla
These slaves were then packed into hulls of ships and 
Taken to the West Indies and the Americas to be sold
For vast profits if they did not die from the journey

Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Farthest standing, I was landing
Two one hand, one man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe

Mad at the world
In a voice of a man, with a bag of a girl
She just avoids the success
It’s what he said
Or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what’s been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker take scene
In a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to afford sun with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings
Getting caught up in the trees

With one heart and one mind

There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, ""truth crushed to earth, would rise again”
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that
“Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies, forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future
And, behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his own”
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr Martin Luther King
And Dr King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people
Is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed
We have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We thank you for what you’ve asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men’s lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined
To keep us from being exterminated
And we thank, the almighty, for the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words, and I hope it would be of assistance in this project

She just walks, and talks to the noise in her heads
Safe in the middle but destroys at the edge
Burns up the nest and poisons the eggs
When the sound hits the ground, the tone seems to beg
For the dark, wanna dart but it's too hard to march
When you heart's nailed down to the ""start, on your mark""
Then a spark but she parked, too caught up in the blitz
To risk ripping them apart
So she wanna stay
On a high tonight to survive

Opening the face to be go washed and awash in the glow
Of the faraway souls of downtown Atlanta

She just runs
And comes to the back of the beginning
Which once was the happiness of winning
The killing contrived the inner vibe, tried to fill her in size
But then survived the attack of other feelings
Cracking at the seals life, hacking it, backing it
Something real as the key to the ease of the bees in the ceilings
Fauceting all the things down from the dark clouds
The valve house, canals, the foul, the undependents, til it breaks
The surge, tsunamis down advantages, knocking down establishments
Washing out the catalyst of fate
Weight filling the room, moon, the moon 
And the wanderlust stuck in downtown Los Angeles

Y puse a tus pies mi vida

Tra??a cargando amarguras
Como recuerdo a mi viejo
Y sus tantas aventuras
Se le volvieron los a??os
En su rostro una madeja
Y transformo su sonrisa
Tan solo con una mueca
Si encuentras en tu camino
A un hombre que va llorando
Dile que a diario en mis rezos
Su nombre voy pronunciando
Por se??as tiene ojos tristes
Herido su coraz??n
Es alto y de pelo blanco
Su mirada es puro amor
Ese se??or de las canas
En las buenas y en las malas
Siempre supo responder
Fue pobre alla por su infancia
Tuvo un poco de ignorancia
Pero la logro vencer
Si encuentras en tu camino
A un hombre que va llorando
Dile que a diario en mis rezos
Su nombre voy pronunciando
Fue andador de mil veredas
De pueblos y calles viejas
All?? quedaron sus a??os
All?? acabaron sus penas.",El Señor de las Canas,2003

Se le aplaude y se le admira

No se andan con la mentira

A los que traen en la mira

Cuando cumple años el jefe
Siempre salen los regalos
Unos le traen cementales
Otros traen carros del año
Unos arriesgan su vida
Y el regalo sale caro

Se dio cuenta Barbarino
De un acérrimo enemigo
Era el que mas estorbaba
Y el emprendió su camino
Iba a rifarse su suerte
Al buscar aquel bandido

Tu le estorbas a mi jefe
Y matarte lo he planeado
Toda la gente del Shaka
Donde quiera te ha buscado
Esta vez vengo por ti
Tu eres mi regalo caro

Se agarraron a balazos

En la frente del bandido
Se le dibujo la muerte

Y te hable de terminar

Y por las noches
Poner mis manos
Sobre tu cuerpo y comenzar otra vez
A descubrirte las semejanzas
Del universo que laten sobre tu piel

Y al despertar
Imaginar que soy la luz y abres los ojos por mi
Y verte entrar al mundo por la puerta sur
De mi razón de vivir
Verte crecer
Sembrado en mi como un rosal
Atado a mi soledad

Lupita d'Alessio,"Solamente la mano de Dios podrá separarnos
Nuestro amor es más grande que todas las cosas
Del mundo, yo sé bien que nacimos lo dos para
Siempre adorarnos, nuestro amor es lo mismo
Que el mar cristalino y profundo

Solamente la mano de Dios podrá castigarnos
Las demás opiniones mi cielo me salen sobrando
Yo seré para ti nada más te lo digo llorando
Cuando tú me trajiste tu amor ya te estaba esperando

Nadie sabe ni puede decir las cosas de amores
Porque todos se entregan borrachos de amor en el mundo
Es por eso que quiero gritar sin matar ilusiones
Que mi amor es lo mismo que el mar cristalino y profundo

Tú no puedes dejarme de amar y yo de adorarte
Porque estamos unidos del alma quien sabe hasta cuando
Solamente la mano de Dios podrá separarnos
Cuando tú me trajiste tu amor ya te estaba esperando",La Mano de Dios,1991
Lupita d'Alessio,"Él me decía que era gaviota del aire
Que no tenía que darle sus cuentas a nadie
Y que no había otro amor, que era el único el mío
Y yo lo creía, y yo les creía y sin tanto esfuerzo me mintió

Él me decía que nadie celaba sus noches
Y que su vida era simple sin trampas de amores
Que solamente en mi puerto anclaba su barca
Y yo le creía, y yo les creía y ciega en sus besos me mintió

Me mintió, me mintió no era libre su amor
Me mintió, me mintió y la imbécil fui yo
Que quemaba mis manos en fuego creyendo en su amor
Me mintió, me mintió no era libre su amor
Me mintió, me mintió era solo un gorrión
Con las ganas de quererlo tanto mintió en el amor
Me mintió, me mintió",Gaviota del Aire,1991
Lupita d'Alessio,"Yo también estuve enamorada como tu
Yo también llore desesperada como tu
Por alguien que no se merecía

Escuchara como tu
Yo también halle quien me
Cuidara como tu
Sintiendo ese miedo escondido
Que da un ser desconocido
Como tu después me recupere
Como tu mi cuerpo en otro
Cuerpo me abandone

Como tu se que necesitaba fracasar

Revisar bien mis maletas
Y sacar mis sentimientos
Y resentimientos todos
Hacer limpieza al armario
Borrar rencores de antaño
Y angustias que hubo en mi mente

Para no sufrir por cosa tan pequeñitas
Dejar de ser niña
Para ser mujer
Hoy voy a cambiar
Sacar a luz mi coraje
Entregarme a lo que creo

Y ser siempre yo sin miedo
Bailar y cantar por hábito
Y ver claro en vez de oscuro
Desarraigar mis secretos
Dejar de vivir, si no es por vivir la vida
Que grita dentro de mi, mi libertad

Hoy voy a cambiar
Salir dentro de mi no ser solo corazón
Dejar y parar fracasos
Soltar los brazos y libertad que oprime mi razón
Volar libre con todos mis defectos

Para poder rescatar mis derechos
Y no cobrarle a la vida caminos y decisiones
Hoy quiero Y debo cambiar
Dividirle al tiempo y sumarle al viento
Todas las cosa que un día soñé conquistar

Porque soy mujer como cualquiera
Con dudas y soluciones
Con defectos y virtudes
Con amor y desamor
Soy como gaviota
Pero felina como una leona

Tranquila y pacificadora
Pero al mismo tiempo irreverente y revolucionaria
Feliz e infeliz
Realista y soñadora
Sumisa por condición
Más independiente por opinión
Porque soy mujer
Con todas las incoherencias que nacen en mi
Fuerte, sexo débil

Hoy voy a cambiar
Revisar bien mis maletas
Y sacar mis sentimientos
Y resentimientos todos

Y mataron mis amores el silencio que les distes

Luqman Hamza,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2000
Luqman Hamza,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2000

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2000
Luqman Hamza,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2000

Who lost his love through his indifference

And every road that takes him, takes him down

While life goes on around him everywhere

And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

From some enchanted land

Must it be forever inside of me,

Why can't I let you know,

stuck with you through your rainy days
thought that it was just a phase
when the sun came out i tried
to get away and fly
but the needs we had did not subside
what a way for our love to die


i've been hiding behind my gifts
i give until it starts to rip
the skin is torn where i begin
the thread is worn and might give in
underneath it all i feel the eyes
of all the things that i despise
can i fight them off with sticks and stones?
can i fight them off alone?

soothe yourself 
soothe yourself

now i'm thinking about my own advice
if i could soothe myself it might be nice
callin' names ain't the same no more

memories and cold hard facts
watched it all come rushing back
all the times i told you what to do
all the times i thought i knew

all about coming from dust
cashed it i to buy a few locks i knew wouldn't rust
if i lock you up
will the edges fade 
will you understand
how simple i am
i can walk for many miles
thinking that i'll never comprehend
i can't argue worth a damn
'cause i know my questions never end

if i walk away
will the phrases play
or will they all become one
under the sun
 
and when the pleasure is done
(why don't i want to know it all) 
(why don't i want to know it all)
and when the measuring's done
somehow i already know it all

answers never satisfy
i wear them out as soon as they come
i lie in between the sides
i'm happy when the fighting is done
so i'll read the news
and i'll get the blues
and i'll make it matter
for a minute or two

of living in the deep frost

They can make me soar and touch extremes

I just fell down from whitest skies
And now I start to realise
And all the colours talk to me

And if I had wings then I could take you in
I'd stay on the ground and I could teach you things
The grass is strewn with blades of gold
These sights and songs I have been told
All hopes desires that seem to sing

Come on little man now you're times nearly through
Colours are dripping down red and blue
I'm standing in the middle of a great glass ball
I'm told that I've nothing but I'm having it all

My eyes were opened so widely
And its a shame to end this way",Thoughtforms,1989

But silver winds cut my skin everywhere

After the act close my eyes
I always longed for the deep

Can you make it alone

So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
