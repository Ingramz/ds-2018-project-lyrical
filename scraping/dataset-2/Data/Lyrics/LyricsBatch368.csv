Hothouse Flowers,"You know the way I could never say no
To anything at all
You know the way you just got to let go
Before you take the fall
You came out of the smoke before me I had to take you in
Then right there you spoke and told me you're ready to begin
So I'll find the time, take all day
Find a smile and find the way
Took the time went for a stroll somewhere I'd never been
Kick the ball let it roll and watch it spin
I know that we can bring this through
All we got to do is start
Take a positive step forward to the scary part of the heart
And find the time take all day
Find a smile and find the way
Woke up late last night, never felt so good
Went outside for a walk, went tripping through the wood
Back to bed to think of you, babe I'll see you soon
But instead of you I'll send my kisses straight up to the moon
And find the time, find the day
Find a smile and find the day......
Oh baby baby baby baby, find a smile and find the way
We can bring this through, we can bring this through
",Find the Time,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"I'm sitting on my own by the fire again
And the healing is turned on
I've been just out drinking and I feel my mind is gone
And the flames are dancing like a ballerina
Reminding me of you
And the night that we fell through the mist
And we made one out of two yeah

And I think I'm going to go out and buy a diamond
And I think I'm going to dress you up in white
Forever more forever more forever more forever more
I like a drink that takes some time to settle
It's worth the wait and it tastes just like a dream
And my soul is full of gold and precious metals
And my heart is singing a song that's never been
And I think I'm going to go out and buy a diamond
And I think I'm going to dress you up in white

Forever more forever more forever more forever more
And the first night that we made love was so wrong
And the night that we got drunk to write this song
And the friends we couldn't tell what's going on
Took us to a place where we belong, where love is strong
Love be strong, love grows strong ah
Forever more forever more forever more forever more",Forever More,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"We finished what we had, we had created
This big rolling ball, tore us apart
This is for the record I never meant the pain
Spitting volcano, waiting to explode
That's how it is, that's where we are
Yes it was good, but it went too far
It's hard to let go, when no one can talk
Two years on, we're learning to walk
Sometimes when I sleep, if I ever sleep at all
I dream of you, standing in the cold
Most of the time, I'm too tired to talk
Too scared to reveal, to show you it all
That's how it is, that's where we are
Yes it was good, but it went too far
It's hard to let go, when no one can talk
Two years on, we're learning to walk
I'm reading a page, cobwebs of rage
I'm building a cage for you to embrace
Forever the fool, forgetting my lines
I'm lost in sublime, healing in time
That's how it is...
",Learning to Walk,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"You introduced me to all of your friends
I saw your kindness
And what it said was that the lie would end
It's where you'll find us
If you're suspicious then just read the guide
The drum is leading
She'll bring you deep inside your troubled mind
To what you're feeling
Can I watch you fly, when I cry
Just carry on what you're doing
Don't ignore me keep doing it
And if I die, make sure your mind is in this song
See all the images are up ahead, go easy sister
The universe cries out to be your friend, you might have kissed her
Oh come alive in visible heart, spinning like a sparkler wheel
Some people jive when they hear music start
Oters just kneel
See all the images up ahead, go easy sister
The universe waits to be duly fed
You might have kissed her
Come alive invisible heart, spinning like a sparkler wheel
Some people jive when they hear it start
Others just kneel
",Pop Song,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"You make me feel so good, you make me feel so good
You tame a wild man, just like no other could
I'm going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
When I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb
You're gentle to the bone, pure and homegrown
You're living every day, you're a precious stone
I'm a going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
And when I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb
I hope it never ends, I hope it never ends
'cause I'd be too long lonely but I'd be back again
I'm going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
When I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb......
",Turn Up the Reverb,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"You drive really fast sitting in your car
You like to blow kisses but you don't know where you are
Everything you say really makes me mad
When you stand still you're the best I ever had
Your remote control turns you on
You can even change color surfing all night long
All the old pictures hanging on the wall
Hold a million secrets you can't recall
And I wonder what you do
Everybody wants a piece of you
The radio is playing and the music takes me back
To when we used to call it love
When we used to call it love
You're always getting caught but never break the rules
When you go out dancing everything is cool
Your remote control tells you what to see
I am running you are free
And I wonder what you do
Everybody wants a piece of you
The radio is playing and the music takes me back
To when we used to call it love
When we used to call it love",Used to Call It Love,1998

Hothouse Flowers,"Hallelujah Jordan he went to the nearest bar he ordered
Whiskey and Soda
See how far he'd get to forgetting her
Yeah

He met her in an all night cafe
And they sat all night drinking coffee
And talking, and they found they had a lot in common
And later on they went back to his place and sat till dawn
Laughing, Talking, yeah, they found they had a lot in common

He was young
He had a young spirit
They could have kissed all night
And he knew that he loved her, yeah

But now you'll find Hallelujah Jordan in some unknown late bar
Trying to tell strange folks his secrets and his problems, yeah

Yeah, you'll find Hallelujah Jordan in a late bar in the ghetto
Wine stains on his belly and Oh He'll tell ya
How she was falttered by a smart young man
He drove a fast car and Ooh Ooh she went

Hallelujah Jordan, you can tell me your secrets
You can tell me your problems
I think I know what you mean

Now Hallelujah loves the bottle more brittle than her body
More brittle than the heart that she'd broken, yeah

Hallelujah left this town
The next drink he had he drowned, Oh
Finally drowned his sorrows, Yeah

",Hallelujah Jordan,2001
Hothouse Flowers,"This song tells exactly how, when I was, while I was
Sitting back on my deep pile reclining chair
Thinking about my life and all the good things that happened

Well, it just came to mind to me that
Yeah, came to mind to me that
I ain't been treatin' her too bad, too well, too well

No I been pushin' her 'round and you know
There comes a time in every mans life when he's got to
Look over his misdemeanors, misgivings, misfortunes and
Miss whatever her name is

Yeah, I'll say you're sorry, sorry

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
'Cos I been telling you lies, standing on your face
I been making you cry all over the places, Lord
I should have known, yeah, I should've known better
Well, I could not phone, Lord I, I could, I could, I could, but I'm

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

You know I'm crazy, sorry
Sorry, sorry, baby, baby, baby

I think this time I realized
Get down on my knees and apologies

Oh Lord, I didn't know when I hurt you
I didn't know when you cried
I didn't know when you screamed, ""Lord""
I didn't know when you stopped to cry

I didn't know when you called
I didn't know when you hurt

Hothouse Flowers,"If the lonely night surrounds you
Yeah you're weighed down by gloom
No you don't like what it feels in
Your dark and dirty room

It'll be easier in the morning
It'll be easier in the day
Sun will shine on though your window
We got light to lead the way

Looks like the bottle has run empty
Yeah your heart is torn and dry
Lord you don't like what it feels like
Your sad and lonely eyes

Looks like the highways never ending
Yeah your legs they feel like lead
Lord you're twisting yeah and turning
In your wide and lonely bed

It'll be easier in the morning etc.

Looks like you got no one you can talk to

No one left to talk to

And your heart is torn'n'blue
Yeah you look in no direction

No direction...

I guess these words might pull you through
",It'll Be Easier in the Morning,2001
Hothouse Flowers,"As a child touching age we think that it's so
That life, love and everything is easy to know
The old, they can't reach us, their ways are not ours
Though they furrowed our futures, our freedom they bore

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me

I believe in these people, I believe in this age
Though I hear about torment in lives lonely page
Yet still we walk strong, we'll remember we're free
For the truth we are given, for what we believe

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me, oh

I have searched out the answers to the mysteries, the laws
Though still I find barriers, yet still I would fall
But I still struggle on the truth that I seek
But I must remain strong for the lonely, the weak, the weak, the old

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me, older we get

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me, yes

It came to me when I needed it so bad
A long time, a long time I wasn't waiting
I wasn't down with what I had
Let me start, let me start at the beginning
When I first set eyes on you, I knew that you'd be the one
Be the one that makes me feel like living
You're the one that makes me feel

When you speak, when you sing
I see beauty shining down on everything
'Cause your heart is still so pure
You're as precious as the day that you were born
Let me start, let me start at the beginning

I knew that you'd be the one

Will brighten up your days
It can't be wrong
If it makes you feel so right

Walk the line, go ahead
It will surely blow your mind
You can show them what
We're all about

Take a minute just to get away
The perfect time
To plan your big mistake

And your head starts to spin
And your teeth get numb

As it swallows the sun
This high won't last forever
Get your head together

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Well, the day goes by so slow
When you've got four more to go
And you left your head in the radio
Too much time to think of what to think about
I can't find a reason to let it all out

No one has anything good to say
Close your eyes and make them go away
Can you make them go away?

Living lies inside the Devil's eyes
Beneath the cloaks he holds your paradise

And your head starts to spin
And your teeth get numb
The black sky burns
As it swallows the sun
This high won't last forever

She sits and she waits for the one
That she loves to come for her
To take her out, get her out of that house
Where her demons lie down before her

I heard that she says
She's better off dead than with someone else
And she'll find, yeah, she'll find no greater love

Everyday
In the morning he waits up
To find his way to forget her
Too worried to rhyme, too fucked up to fight
Too afraid what's to come in the future

Despite what she says
He's there every single chance he gets
And he doesn't
No, he doesn't wanna be like them

And it's so hard for them to see each other now
That it's all said and done
You never know how much you love a person
Until that day they're gone
But it's not over 'til it's over
Over 'til it's over

",Until It's Over,2007
House of Fools,"[Verse 1:]
In a world that seems so fake, artificial everything;
Oh I just want be real,
I gotta say how I feel, can't wait.

Always looking at myself,
Never liking what I see;
I never gave me the chance,
Never knew what I really could be.

[Chorus 1:]
(Better than living a lie),
(it's better than wearing a disguise);
Take a chance on you,
(You just be you),
(take a chance on you).

[Verse 2:]
I can't say the world has changed,
They still judge by what they see.
Though I can't help what they say,
I know who's inside of me.

It's okay to take that chance,
Try your possibilities (possibilities);
No one can do what you do,
Or stop all the things you can be
(they can't even stop what you're gonna be).

[Chorus 2:]
(Better than living a lie) living a lie,
(it's better than wearing a disguise);
Take a chance on you,
(You just be you),
(take a chance on you, on you).

[Bridge:]
The grass is always green on the other side,
It's when you're looking through your insecure eyes.
And it's better than living a lie (living a lie),
So much better than wearing a disguise,
(take a chance on you) You just be you,
(You just be you, You just be you).

[Ending:]
It's better (better)
Than living a lie (living a lie),
So much better than wearing a disguise;
(take a chance on you),
(take a chance on you),
(take a chance on you),
You just be you.

Now gimme some room, and I'll explode
Cock back my hammer, then squeeze off my load
So hit the road, Jack, and don't come back no more

To step up, cause you'll get swept up
Like dust, or I just might bust and unload my clip
Unless you're a punk, then I'll just pop you in the lip
And show you the deal, now how did that feel
You know I'm killin' any pig that squeels
I'm fillin' up reels of tape with my fly rhymes
And I've got a subsciption to High Times
Son Dooby's in the back, the Mexican Ralph Emms is on the track
My DJ Lethal, he's on the cut
When I bust a dope rhyme, it's like bustin' a nut
So let me jerk off on the mic and get it sticky
When I drink a brew it's either Guinness or mickeys
I'll put your head out just like a fuckin' Malboro
Don't fuck with me, punk, you know that I'm thorough
Bred like a race horse, right-in-your-face force
Feedin' you beats, straight off the streets
So catch me catch me, if you can
You know I'm the man like Chewbacca knows Han
Solo, bolos are what I'll be throwin'
When I be flowin', I get the job done
Cause I'm number one, the Prodigal Son

And not with the same style, I'm known to get buckwild

That the white man is back

I come in peace, but you'll leave in pieces

Everyday I'm sleepin', every night I'm doin' shows
Always gettin' hoes when there's hoes to get got
Always wear my hat so I never need a shot
Always drink a beer before I write a rhyme
And if I have to drive I avoid the one time
Stay between the lines and I won't get pulled over
I don't need luck cause I got a four leaf clover
Yea I'm Irish, word to the motherland
But on the otherhand

'Cause I've got the right one, like Ray Charles
Follow, swallow, the funky pass the bottle
'Cause I get recked like if I crashed my auto

I'll play it, I'll win it, I've done it, I did it
Some say I'm kiddin' but right at this minute
I'll freak it, I'll funk it and like a country bumpkin
From Albuquerque who's gonna carve the turkey
Ready, serve, entertain like Merv
Griffin, sniffin' panties, I'm a prev

The Dooby funk fellow, smooth like a jello
Some say mellow, complicated like a dello
The freakin' who's speakin' freaks it every weekend
'Cause I'll be trick or treatin' I used to drive a Lincoln
Drivin', speedin', hey Rid, I'm readin'
I make more money than that kid Alex Keaton

I rip flesh, yes y'all, run for the mess hall
And get your grub while I'm rhymin' on your dub
Gettin' play at the club, then I step to the pub
And crack a brew, what the fuck ya gonna do?

I rip shit, kill it, cut your gut and spill it
Treat ya like a gas tank, take your ass and fill it
And take ya for a ride to where I reside
Put your face in my pillow, and have ya weepin' like a willow
I tax that but, wax that ass
Floss a nut in your teeth, then wait for you to beef

That's what it is y'all
That's what it is, that's what it is
That's what it is y'all
That's what it is, that's what it is

House of Pain,"I'm a wood peckin' peckerwood
Take me out, ya never could
Act up in my neighbourhood
You better not, my aim is good
The House Of Pain is not a gang
Just a funky Irish name
A Celtic savage makin' cabbage
With corn beef on the side
Irish pride is what I got
I got a lot so don't dispute it
Constantly I'm zooted
If ya got a gun then shoot it
Pick any beat I rock it
I'm always in the pocket
You try to ill, I grab my gat
And now you see me cock it
Next I pull the trigger
I don't care if you're bigger
You try to con yourself you're bulletproof
But how ya figure?
The caps that I'll be poppin'
They'll have your body droppin'
You thought you knew the deal
But now you feel your heartbeat stoppin'
I'm moppin' up the comp
That's short for compitition
I write my lyrics like
The Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen

Chorus
The House Of Pain in effect, y'all
I say the House Of Pain is in effect
You know the House Of Pain is in effect y'all
And anyone that steps up in gettin' wrecked

I'm a beer drinkin' fighter
The bike in Easy Rider
I only roll my spliffs
With the extra easy riders
Papers to vapours
Is what you'll all be catchin'
Meanwhile I'll be snatchin'
Up your hoes and all your dough
The styles that I'll be kickin'
You know they're finger lickin'
Good, the peckerwood never could play the victim
Only the offender
I go out on a bender
Drink a case of brew
And then disgrace the crew
But only if it's Mickey's
I never wear no dickeys
Only wear the Levi's
My whole family cries

Chorus",House of Pain Anthem,1992

Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe

House of Pain,"Remember when the shit hit the fan and the man wanted to know
which way you ran?
(Life goes on) (4x)

Back it up, smack it up, pop your corn
I got more style than Son Dooby's got horn
Top o the morn, rise and shine
LA swine, got no spine
Drop that stick, pig, my crew's real thick
Drop your gun, pig, and get a real dick
I got my gat cause I don't trust ya
Play me close and make me nervous, I'll bust ya
LA's no joke, the cops don't care
They'll beat ya down till there's just a fuckin' hair
Of life left in ya, then they'll pin ya
Way out in Wayside, watch your backside
White and black crime is what goes on
And life goes on

Chorus
And life goes on (13x)

And on and on till the break of dawn
And on to the next day, ay yo, by the way
Did you know about the science of creation
About the Masons, about their nation
Of disarm, this arm, a lega lega or a head
To the thirty-third degree, you know that's me
Ease back, so ease off or I'll squeeze off
My clip, please don't trip, or we's gonna flip
The House Of Pain makes clouds a rains
On parades, I wear shades when it's sunny
Sometimes I rock funny, I ain't in it for the money
But I get mine before the show goes on
And life goes on

Chorus",Life Goes On,1992
House of Pain,"Huh!  Check it out!  Everybody in the house, check it out!
The House Of Pain is in full effect
Call me the corn fed, peckerwood, redneck cracker
White bread, shit kickin' Irish beat jacker
Comin' with the style of a Celtic rebel
Those who ain't on my level call me the blue eyed devil
But that's just because they don't know what I know
And that's just because they can't flow like I flow
I rip shit, dip shit, so what you gotta say
Why you want to play, I fuck you up with no delay
And knock your motherfucking fronts out
Smoke my philly blunts out, my buddha never runs out
I turn the little scunts out
And I got the hookers callin' me pops
Once their cherry pops, Everlast gets all the props
I'm hittin' skins from here to Copenhagen
I bed the wenches cause you know I'm a pagan
The House Of Pain, that's the name of my crew
You don't like it, tough luck, what the fuck you gonna do
Nothin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
You need to start puffin' and relax
Or you'll wind up gettin' taxed
For your money, for your jewels, for your car, for your ho
My crew, they start trippin' while I'm rippin' up the show

Chorus

Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
I said Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
One for the road, this is one for the road
For my man Matt Champy, this is one for the road
Tura lura lura, tura lura li
Tura lura lura, that's an Irish lullaby
No need to act fly, you'll be sayin' nighty-night
The place you're in is right if you're lookin' for a fight
Step up, your blood, I spill it
Put on the beat, I kill it
I'll burn ya like some bacon that's been fryin' in my skillet
Move over Sizzlean, my favorite color's green
But I'll beat ya black and blue, cause I'm always with my crew

Chorus 2X",One for the Road,1992
House of Pain,"Yea, check it out now
Everybody check it out now
Yo, I got the corn beef
I got the moz
I got the shotty
Ay yo, I got the buck shot
Ay yo, I got the burgers
I got the grill
If you're steppin' up next
Ya better flex that skill
The House Of Pain is in full effect
Everybody in the place give full respect
If your girl's in the house keep the ho in check
And if I'm bustin' off caps, you better hit the deck
Steppin' on stage with the fly routines
I'm hemmin' up suckers like bell bottom jeans
I always switch trains in Jamaica, Queens
When I go to by the street to see my Aunt Ilene
Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style
The money back guarantee, I make it worth your while
I'm layin' out fools like kitchen tile
You come around with a frown, and ya leave in a pile
Step back man, I ain't a black man
But everytime I grab the mike I rock a phat jam
Without the Slimfast, and if I skim past
You know I step up and get a ho with gym blast
I give her what she wants, even if she fronts
The Hill is down with the House, they got the philly blunts
Ya know we roll 'em up, and then we light 'em up
And then we puff them up and pass them
So Danny Boy blasts 'em
I got the shell-toe Adidas, with the fat strings
The Celtic crosses and the Claddagh rings
The straight edges razor and the marther pump
You heard me shit clickin', now it's time to jump
Jump around just like a frog on a log
Fuck the Dukes because I like Boss Hogg
I'm hittin' home runs like my man Wade Boggs
And if you try to act stupid, I'm droppin' the dogs
Everytime I go to town
People start kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if my dog's a hound (hound)
You better stop kickin' my dog around

Chorus
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit (4x)

Now I've droppin' records since the age of seventeen
First I came solo, but I now I got a team
It's the four man crew, with the Irish stew
You catch us puffin' on a blunt, and sippin' a brew
What's up with that brew, man, hurry up and finish
Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guinness
You can drink the Guinness while I'm sippin' on the mickeys
When it comes to hookers, yo, the Everlast is picky
Always got my hat in case I come across a quicky
And when I do my shows I get the hoes all hot and sticky
The House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
I say the House Of Pain is in full effect
You know the House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
And anyone who steps up is gettin' wrecked

Chorus 2X

Check it out now!  Owww!
I said the House Of Pain!
We out",Put on Your Shit Kickers,1992
House of Pain,"I rip shit like a bow when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow deadly
I'm no punk see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm goin' all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm livin, punk you better stall out
This is the House of Pain
To come inside is insane

Chorus
I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out

Who steps the booze
When the hoods want to take a cruise
They're feelin' the effects of the booze
Ain't no clues to hold with them fools
Who got smoked even though they scrat crews
You got bruise but I got the booma
Trigger to blast ya askin the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In the do what's the difference if your think of droppin Jews
Carbon copy think you're so cool
Stop dreamin' and hallucinatin'
You're caught up in a piece of pain
Click click, punk, now you're thinkin' oh shit
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead

Chorus

Blessed with the gift, and gifts with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smokin' a fat blunt, waitin' for some punk
To act up like he's got somethin' in him
Then I grab the mike and start spittin' out venom
Coughin' up headstones, blowin' out headphones
Steppin' to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothin' personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef, and you'll wind up losin' teeth
Cause I don't give up the mike that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't gettin' it
Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweatin' it

Chorus",Put Your Head Out,1992
House of Pain,"Yo, the time has come 
For everyone to clean up their own backyard
Before they go knocking on their neighbor's door

Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You want to fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A descendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin, you can bet you'll be chokin
on a fist full of nuttin, meanwhile I'll be puffin
on a fat blunt, what punk?  You don't know the half
Tryin to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin, I'm buckwhylin
The House of Pain is pumpin, start jumpin
Freak it, funk it, back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin it
Then you'll get a beatin just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shileighly
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the Tin Man
you got no heart, here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy

I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I

Real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel
Introspection an afterthought, swimmin in guilt your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow, 
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know, cause you're John Doe

Feeling like DeNiro in Taxi Driver

Looks like I'm walkin through a livin Hell
So spark that L, and I'll get lifted
Feelin the effects of what my spliff did
Cause I'm gifted, I read Sun Tzu
I bought a Gun too so you'll never come too
The weight of the world ridin on my shoulders
Cause I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya

House of Pain,"I'm sick, demented
I came to represent it
I rose from the grave
I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'cause the gloc they found
was stolen
that's how I'm rollin'
Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
So I don't like Marky
or the monarchy
don't start me up like a rolling stone
or I'll leave ya sulkin like Maculay Culkin in Home Alone

So get a grip like Steven Tyler
I used to trip with the divine styler
back in the days there were Irish ways
and Irish laws, stand up for the cause

(chorus)
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man

(Danny Boy)
Well it's the D to the A, double N why BO
why, cause I rock shit like I run it in you
It's a black day, avenge quick run get the vest ?
I'm down with the Hill cause I still got the skill
To turn the party out
Its all about the skyscraper
Your girl caught the vapors
so I might videotape her
I make a lot of papers so I don't have to scrape the
bottom of the barrel
I rock fly apparel
Now I could pull your car
stating up the Harley David - son
I got the gun, so the drama, you could save it

Well it's the mad bum rushin'
funky with percussion
from LA to Flushing
I get your girlie blushin'
I'll cutcha like a butcher,
Well it ain't Joe the writer (?)
the old rock a loop cause I'm super like Schneider

(chorus)

I'm ill, retarded
so don't get me started
I might lose my cool
ya lose if we do
cause I can stomp a hole in the soul of a monk
with the rhymes in my head and the beats in my trunk
I got skill kid
and I run the mill kid
for all its worth, I'm gettin mines on Earth
so step to the next head
or like Sadat X said
'He's gone and that's how it flows to be
Don't stand so close to me!'

(chorus)",On Point,1994
House of Pain,"I'll in them clothes all the gray
I'll stay if you go away
Concrete, tall as the sky
Movement passing me by

And you blush, what a rush
Reminisce, cold crush
Next door, ear to the wind
All the tension made for the core

I wish, I wish
I wish it was all that easy
I wish, I wish
I wish it was all that easy",All That,1994
House of Pain,"Straight out the casket, risin' up
Open up your eyes, can't you see me?
What the fuck is this? Madness, pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kickin', breathing the air
Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there
No question, my suggestions of the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin'
Messin' with me, you're messin' with the best
Blaow, you're takin' two shots to your chest

'Cause I'm back from the dead.
Everlast comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head

Back from the dead, back from the dead

You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it
And if you can't feed it then why not blow
You may be positive and not even know
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling
I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealin' like a pig
My grave's something you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum, back yard or Colosseum

Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, 'nuff said

Skip the autopsy 'cause I never O.D.'d
I only puff boom kid, I never get skeed
I don't sniff or shoot up, riff I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick fast, Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam I'm still alive
(Look at all these rumors)
Spreadin' like tumors, gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you believed 'em, well then you got gassed
The media deceived 'em just like in the past

'Cause I'm, back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head

Back from the dead, back from the dead

Like Steven Seagal I'm hard to kill
Like GiGi Allen I'm crazy ill
I'll beat you down with my mic, kick your ass with my Nike
Bust you in the eye if you tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin' I'm dead you must be smokin' dust
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must

House of Pain,"I'm a swing it
Watch me bring it
To the next level
The graphic devils
Gettin' funky like the Nevilles
Brothers from the bayou,
So why you want to trip
Just play the sideline kid
And wait for me to trip
'Cause I can feel it in the air tonight
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
'Cause I search and destroy
Retoy with the plot
Tryin' to get what I got
Ya might get shot
Hot damn I'm a slam ya like ONYX
Then teach ya how to write a rhyme
Like hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
'Cause I get loose at the jam and wreck the whole party
I make em' jump and mosh
Oh my gosh
There slamin in the pit
When I'm kickin my shot
They're buggin at the eyes
'Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm numero uno
Dos not cuatro
word to cool Kieth
I'm a break up your teeth
When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe and take a bite
And if they don't taste right then don't blame D (D)
You need to quit swingin
The styles that I'm bringin
The funk knuckle dragon
The kids on the wagon
I'm not the 12 stepper
Don't play me like a lepper
My mic sounds nice
But it's not Salt-n-Pepa
Well it's the man with the plan
To get all your skins
The tip of my dick is where the line begins
So hoe's form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass butt naked
Let's see if you can take it
'Cause I'll make you feel...
LIKE A NATURAL WOMEN!
'Cause I keep it comin'
I'm the Everlastin'
Free style assassin
My soul and my goal is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the Daily Sun
Throw her down on the bed
And tie her up wit ropes
I'm just another rager with a Dairy Face
Punk motherfuckers beef and rhyme my race
You need to step back kid and give me some space
So I can cold spark the party when I'm rockin the place
Danny Boy's arrivin'
I Stand six five and a half, don't laugh kid
The outlaw biker with my big shit kicker
On a highway to hell
'Cause I never tell
Well it's the funk back breaker
We heat it up like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party cause I'll take her
Hit the deck 'cause I'm down with the Hoolis
I got a trunk full of funk like the groovy doolies
I'm not the man but I'll asked who was he
Quick's hot the hair do just like Ruth Buzzy
Runnin' 'round town like ya been to jail son
But ya hit the swap meet to get your hair and your nail done
Get off my sack
'Cause your shit is wack
Ya dis me and I'm a dis ya back

House of Pain,"Verse One: Everlast

Johnny was a bad boy, he was juvenile delinquent
He had his picture on the wall of every precinct
He had a rep of hanging out with his homies
Puffin on the blunts and sippin on the forties
But when he spoke, nobody would listen
And when he was home, yo, his parents they would diss him
They called him a bum a worthless piece of shit, so over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag and heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood liquor store
Pulls out a gun tells the old man ""Hit the floor!""
Then breaks open the register drawer
Pulls out the money stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol then he starts to cock it
The man panics and gun goes off
Stupid old fool made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care cause Johnny was thought
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught (repeat 3X)
That's how it is homie like it or not

Verse Two: Evelast

Now coming out store Johnny shot two Haisidic Jews
And when he got home his face was on the news
His mom freaked out told him get the fuck out
That when the pigs rolls up, so yo he ducked out
He hit the backdoor like his name was Carl Lewis
Skipped to the payphone to find out where his crew is
He called up his homeboy Jose, ""Word up!""
""Can I come over my man?"", he said, ""No way 
a cop was here he was looking all over for you
but I told the pig that I didn't know you""
He said, ""Cool meet me up at the school
I need a ride cause I'm wanted for homicide""
Johnny got a gun and now he's on the run
But he don't care to him this shits fun
Now that he's an outlaw sorta like Robin Hood
The hard rock hero of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him he'll wind up in court
But it ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus

New Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a sale if it don't get bought
It ain't a show if I don't get paid

Freak your mind
And wreck your brain
The thoughts I would have
would drive most insane

Gettin' Down wit' Jimmy
Hendrix, and Page
Make up the rage

McLou's back yard
Me and D was starvin'
And times were hard
Danny used to roll through
Schemin' on the hustle
Credit cards and slang
M..MC bangin'
Lethal used to come with his reel to reel
We didn't have no deal
But that wasn't the point, we'd...
Rock a funky joint
Then we'd rock another
The only thing to eat
Was some bread, and peanut butter

They didn't forget me

I thought we was people
I'm tryin' to get mine
I thought you had my back

Makin' every mark that was out after dark
Stick 'em for their loot, cut em up then I'd dash
And when I had to shoot, I'd nutted up for the cash
Ran down the block with my 45 glock
Capped off a round, everybody hit the ground
The next thing I heard was a siren
Couldn't turn around, money grip kept firin'
Runnin' for the ride, I can't go inside
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Makin' all the runs, Rakin' in the funds
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood
Now people thinkin' Danny lost his mind
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hardtimes
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die
Now I got the work and the dough, 25 grand and a 5 keys of blow
I gotta' relocate and start all over
But watch it blow up like a supernova
I keep my game in tight and follow the plan
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

I got myself locked down in the pen
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud
So I pick out a hardrock and rush him in his cell
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell
And if I gotta' do him, scrw him, the convict's dead
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

Mama I just killed a man 
Put the gun against his head 
Pulled the trigger, now he's dead 
My rhapsody's bohemian 
But ya never see me in 
Jail cause I just made bail 
I gotta good attourney so the man can't burn me 
Presley to the Jackson, Getz to the Bernie 
Last to the Ever, die I say never 
Even though I done a 
I never run from a 
Punk talkin' junk just to smack his teeth 
Cause I beat a man who said it 
If you really want beef 

It's like that ya'll 
It's like daddy-ilac 
It's like this ya'll, come on! 
It's like this ya'll, come on! 
It's like this ya'll, come on! 
It's like this ya'll, come on! 

With everything so perfect, I really hate to spoil it 
But I think I'm about to loose it, my whole life is in the toilet 
But I think I'm about to loose it, my whole life is in the toilet 

So feel the rush as the flush starts suckin' you in 
You want an earl with your girl, where the fuck you been? 
We're just a couple of friends just drinkin' and cussin' 
There really ain't no need for your fightin' and fussin'

I be gettin' demo out on the corner 
And if it's my turn to get wrecked I'm gonna 
Cause I'm on a expidition 
You could even say I'm going on a mission 
Competition, there ain't none 
Open up your eyes, watch me rise like the sun 
I got the gun plus a buck knife 
Runnin' up on me is like sayin' fuck life 
I got a hot piece of lead just set shit off 
But you're runnin' from my steel cause your butt is soft 
And if you don't cough well then you don't get off 
I beat a man who said it from south to north 
And east to west, sugar, I'm the best 
When it comes to givin' love, I don't give out no stress 
It's strictly Buddha-blessed lovin' in the raw 
I be the flyest white boy you ever saw 
So turn out the lights and lock the door 
Cause I'm bringin' more love than ya bargained for 
And if ya want beef I got fillet mingion 
And if you're looking fot the brothers, just play my song 
Cause I can keep it on and on like Noddy 
Come to the club alone and leave with your hotty

Got a closet in my crib where the hydrophonic grow
Act like you know

It ain't the season
The reasons strictly economic
So pour the jinn and tonic
Pump the Tony Bennet
If wifey ain't watchin' then I'm runnin' up in it
I'll make ya hot and spicy like some wavos rancheros
Then hit the Knicks game with my man Don Terros
And if the Knicks are winnin'
Then Spike Lee's grinnin'
Next I hit the spot with Stretch Armstrong spinnin'
Sippin wiskeys to my favorite cuts
Watchin' all the earthpieces shake their butts
Some People think I'm nuts 'cause I act a little funny
But play me soft I'll beat ya down like ya stole money

I keep it idle with my be	-boy brovado
From downtown Brooklyn
All the way to Colorado

When you go for yours
It matters the most
You like to brake a post
And drink and make a toast
When you don't come up close
Kid, you be coming up boast (?)
Plus, you playin' coastandoast (?)
But you girls on my Jimmy
Try to give me bassoast
Before you finish, kid that's Spanish for pieces
I'm nuttin' up, cuttin' up

Somethin' I can't sweat
Kid you never see me worry

And I'll engage in this gift that's kicked swiftly
Stickin' to the groupie I'm out like some Jiffy
Peanut Butter
You know my style's butter
'Cause every work I utter
Rocks the sky from the gutter
I'll make ya shutter

Well then ya get Vic

Kid, it's making me sick

I'm Danny Boy with the hardcore style
I'm punchin suckers in the mouth like a root canal
Ya get me started then I'm hard to stop

And when I pop off
Ya drop off
Ya get blown out the frame

House of Pain,"If I was to sit down and actually write out a list 
Of the MCs that missed it would be the constitution 
They play their caps backwards still saying whack words 
No power to (durhust) just a few yes men 
Raising the question of who gave you a contract 
They should be fired you're officially retired 

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass 
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools 
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards 
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard 
Thinking you're the white hot man of the hour 
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour 
Back in 89 PE fought the power and in 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw 

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium 
You never played a venue local college or a stadium 
A young boys (fiddin' pad) fad is now a grown mans profession 
To earn this is a blessing 
This skills have me guessing learn cause I'm testing 
Follow this down no question 

No doubt check it out 
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node 
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode 
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is 
Built on lies don't apologize 
Cause once they watch you rise they want to watch you fall 
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall 
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir 
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career 

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 

When its time to rise Ill open the archives 
When you be in dreams you got 85s 
Chrome down with the leather package 
You got a home of your own 
you're holding acres 
I got it made 
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers 
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals 
Crowd scream decibels x2 
In your ear you want to make rapping your career 

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota 
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters 
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights 
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'm a put out his lights 
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved 
We show love they show it back all problems solved 
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump 
But I ain't quitting 'til I'm shitting on Donald Trump 

So take heed to the verses and styles and versions 
When you socialize with other MCs 
And boast your rhymes to company enemies 
And in any cases that feel is what you want 
??? 
You want to make money money and take every honey 
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career 
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier 
Now you want to know fear to impress your peers 
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on",Heart Full of Sorrow,1996

I got ponies, I got mares, and I got stallions
I got planets, I got moons, and I got stars

I got family, I got foes, I got an ally
It's the E man, you got priests and a rabbi
I got knowledge, I got wisdom, I got overstandin'
I got culture, freedom, you got a weakly meat
You have bless, you have blood, you have a sacrifice
You have guilt, you have shame, you got your soul on ice

And God only knows what can make you pursue it
For those who can't dance and clap your hands to it

Verse 3 (Everlast)
You tell me you're the baddest and you get the most cream
But tell me what's the status of your self-esteem

All the bodies that you caught and all the females you sex
Yes yes y'all, true indeed, the sight of the world keeps me high on weed
Makes my eyeballs bleed but i must proceed

Lord have some mercy on my soul
Whoa whoa

Now why everybody making shit that's unreal
Cause the a & r man he wants mass appeal
Forgetting all about how it's supposed to feel
Kids be going out for the record deal
So if you pull out the clap then bust your cap
Or I'm a make like the van and drop bombs on your gap
But don't snap cause this ain't HBO
Kid you got no Benz plus you got no dough
While you say that though you trying to gain that ho
Used to be you had to rhyme about stuff you know
I don't need MTV to make no bucks
I rock styles that make you say ""Ah who dat waz?""
Who that was is the man of all hours sending all star players straight
back to the showers
Fake hard rocks are really just cowards
I master dub plates like my name's Herb Powers
I getcha open like hunting season
I make papers don't front on the reason
Cause I'm seizing up every day
You say carpe diem I call em like I see em

Get up I'll break ya down a little something
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Dead up too many crews be fronting
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Get up I'll break ya down a little something
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting

Get up I'll break ya down a little something
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Dead up too many crews be fronting
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting

Get up I'll break ya down a little something

Dead up too many crews be fronting

Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time
I got what it takes to make this groove complete
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D.
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother cool Nick
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick
I've worked hard and long to master this trade
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)

(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)

(You know I feel alright)

(You know I feel alright)

Everlast is in effect
Gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's, 20's
100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on my tip to get a sip
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid
All across the country my records gettin played
On radio stations, clubs and on tours
And after every show I make three encores
Sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack

(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack

(Ah yeah)
(Hit me)
(Alright)
(Check this out)

Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune
But first I must issue just one word of caution
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety
Everlast is on the rise movin through society
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals
Respected worldwide and feared by locals
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts
E-v-e-are-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme
It's confusing to see so many people so blind
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete

House of Pain,"I used to kick it with the thugs  pushin' drugs in the park 
Makin' every mark that was out after dark 
Stick 'em for their loot  cut em up then I'd dash 
And when I had to shoot  I'd nutted up for the cash 
Ran down the block with my 45 glock 
Capped off a round  everybody hit the ground 
The next thing I heard was a siren 
Couldn't turn around  money grip kept firin' 
Runnin' for the ride  I can't go inside 
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride 
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand 
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man? 

[Chorus (x4)] 
Who's the man with the master plan? 
Who's the man? Who's the man? 

I used to sell yayo back in the day-o 
Ran with the gang, had all the homie's slang 
Grams to the quarters, I'm takin' all the orders 
Makin' all the runs, Rakin' in the funds 
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter 
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood 
Now people thinkin' Danny lost his mind 
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hardtimes 
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew 
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die 
Now I got the work and the dough, 25 grand and a 5 keys of blow 
I gotta' relocate and start all over 
But watch it blow up like a supernova 
I keep my game in tight and follow the plan 
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man? 

[Chorus (x4)] 

I got myself locked down in the pen 
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again 
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect 
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck 
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood 
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud 
So I pick out a hardrock and rush him in his cell 
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell 
And if I gotta' do him, screw him, the convict's dead 
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest 
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho 
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

(making this money man) uh-huh, true that true that
Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over
There on the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby
Know I'm tal'n bout, candy coated still putting it down
Still swanging and banging ha, boys gon feel us man

See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse

Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast

That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene

In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU

And I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a why-2G bird, valeted on the curb

Them tops still dropping, the trunk still popping

And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin

Houston,"Yeah, Its all good, I'm doing better without you (nooo)
Anyway, But its funny, we look just alike (just like you)

Verse 1:
Everyday that I look in the mirror
A reflection of someone I don't remember
But I heard that he was something special
To someone that I hold so dear to me (momma)
(She said he was a singer) Oh he could sing yeeaah
But he used it to abuse a lot of women
Now your seed was a he and that seed is now me
And I love my son (forever) and my son loves me (me)
And I know that its painful but I wish you could see

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways
Cause a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Bridge:
Was never there for me (no no)
How could you betray me
Broke up the family tree
What about me
What about me

Verse 2:
Now I hear that you wanna see me
But I can't let it go not that easy
See a man only knows what he feels
And I feel that I can't trust you
Keep it real, I don't need you
And I can't think that you would think I would ever be like you
Cause its sad that you're my dad
And I don't know you
Even when I see you
And to my son, I could never leave you

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Breakdown:
You was never there
Probably didn't care
That you had a son
While you on the run
Never thought that twice of being in my life
Cause you broke a happy home
Why you leaving us aloneneva
Never gave a damn to find out who I am
Its to late for you to communicate
You was never there
Probably didn't care
That you had a son
While you on the run

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me on her all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya

When you left her on her own to raise me on her all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Never gonna walk, talk like you noo

Houston Calls,"Albert's always sincere; he's a sensitive type
His intentions are clear -- he wanna be well liked
Well, if everything is nothing, then are we anything?
Is it better to be better than to be anything?

And Albert's visions blooming uncontrolled
All his wings are slowly sinking

The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
All the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Einstein's down on the beach standing in the sand
'Cause everything he believes in is shattered
What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway
And we all get burned as one more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall

And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Albert's waiting in the sun
On a field American
For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run and...
Yeah-e-yeah

One more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall

And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Albert's fallen on the sun
Cracked his head wide open

And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen, fallen

The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall

Or how we got this way
Just forget the things I said
Cause today?s a brand new day

Months move by slow
Autumn winds blow through the chimes
How can a second spent without you
Feel to me like a lifetime

I?ll be with you 
In good time

No tongue can tell
How we?ll fare this year through
If so much can change in hours and days
Who?s to say if I?ll know you?

But I?ll brave what comes
Though I?m sure we?ll stretch the ties
That forever stay connected to you
That are anchored in your eyes

We?ll see things through
In good time

I hope you hear this song
And that wherever you are
Know that I am always singing it for you
From the cliffs of this cold shore

And if you ever want to come
I?ll send a quarter note your way
You can ride it here and stay for a while
Or just visit for the day

In time we?ll see
Our hearts set free
And you won?t need me
In good time

Houston Davis Jones,"We always think, 
We're more mature than that.
This time won't be like the others.
Then when it's time for us to get back
We always seem to have a setback or two

Why do we always feel compelled to return to this state
That we've been in before many a time'
Are our lives really that much better when we're together
Is it really worth the pain we put ourselves through

Or da da da da da da da

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Houston Person,"I see trees of green, red roses too 
I see them bloom for me and you 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world 

I see skies of blue and clouds of white 
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world 

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces of people goin' by 
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' ""How do you do?"" 
They're really sayin', ""I love you."" 

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you

Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat

Houston Symphony Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

Howard Alden,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Howard Alden,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2004

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1978

My dear, sweet child. That's what I do. It's what I live for. 
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself. 
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn

Go ahead!

Ein Jahr lang war ich ohne dich, ich brauchte diese Zeit für mich
Kann sein dass ich ein and'rer bin, als der der damals von dir ging

Ich weiß du wirst mich nicht viel fragen
Wie damals werd ich einfach sagen

Hello again, ich sag einfach hello again
Du ich möchte dich heut noch sehn, dort wo alles begann
Oh, hello again, dort am Fluss wo die Bäume stehn
Will ich dir in die Augen sehn, ob ich da bleiben kann

Noch ein paar Stufen bis zur Tür, ich spür ein wenig Angst in mir
Wie kann ich nur so sicher sein, vielleicht lebst du nicht mehr allein
Ich würde gern für immer bleiben, das kann ich nicht allein entscheiden
Vielleicht wird uns noch viel verbinden
Vielleicht musst du erst zu mir finden

Samstag Nacht - und do hast nur deine Lieder. Die Sehnsucht kommt wieder in jeder Samstag Nacht. do machst die Augen zu, tanzt einen Blues, niemand hat an Dich gedacht. Die Zeit, wo die Sehnsucht erwacht kommt in jeder Samstag Nacht.Und dein Wagen ist dort vor dem Haus abgestellt,doch do weißt nicht, wohin sollst do fahr'n. do fühlst Dich so verraten jetzt,weil seine Freunde deine war'n. do, ich kenn' das Gefühl, wenn man langsam erkennt, ohne den anderen weiß; man nichts zu tun,und am schlimmsten sind die Nächte dann, da bin ich so allein wie du. Samstag Nacht - und do hast nur deine Lieder. Die Sehnsucht kommt wieder in jeder Samstag Nacht. do machst die Augen zu, tanzt einen Blues, niemand hat an Dich gedacht .Die Zeit, wo die Sehnsucht erwacht kommt in jeder Samstag Nacht.Oh - Samstag Nacht - und do hast nur deine Lieder.Die Sehnsucht kommt wieder in jeder Samstag Nacht. do machst die Augen zu, tanzt einen Blues,niemand hat an Dich gedacht.Die Zeit, wo die Sehnsucht erwacht kommt in jeder Samstag Nacht.

Howard Carpendale,"Sally called, when she got the word,
She said ""I suppose you've heard
About Alice.""
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive. 
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

Grew up together, two kids in the park,
Carved our initials deep in the bark
Me and Alice.
Now she walks to the door, with her head held high,
Just for a moment, I caught her eye,
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive. 

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

Sally called back, and asked how I felt,
She said ""I know how to help
You get over Alice.""
She said ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting 24 years.""
And the big limousine disappeared.

Howard Carpendale,"E cosi' te ne vai,
forse, mi mancherai
non si puo' stare soli
amo te, niente piu'

e non c'e' piu' bisogno d'inventare
le sere per poterti divertire
la scusa dei blue jeans che fanno male
per poi finire sempre a far l'amore.

E non c'e' piu' la luna che ti guarda
l'avevi detto tu che e' un po' bugiarda
il vento che portava il tuo sapore
la voglia matta di ricominciare.

Piangerai? Forse si', forse no, se non piangi tu
Scriverai? Forse si', forse no, se mi scrivi tu
Dove andrai? Forse qua, forse la', ti ritrovero'
Ci sarai? Forse solo un momento ti aspettero'

E non ti posso dire piu' domani
ripeti mille volte che mi ami
sei dolce tu che prendi la mia mano
lo sai che come te non c'e' nessuno.

Und die Dünen nur und das weite Meer
Und mir war als ob ich die Zeit
Ganz fest in meinen Händen wär

Es gab nur uns beide für mich 
Ich wusste ich hatte dich
Wie einfach und klar doch alles war

Deine Spuren im Sand 
Die ich gestern noch fand
Hat die Flut mitgenommen 
Was gehört nun doch mir
Deine Liebe sie schwand 
Wie die Spuren im Sand
Was ist mir nur geblieben 
Nur die Sehnsucht nach dir

Ich weiß nicht wann du anfingst
Ohne mich die Stadt entlang zu gehen
Und wenn ich dich danach fragte
Stumm an mir vorbeizusehen
Bis man die ganze Wahrheit versteht
Ist es nicht selten zu spät
Da bin ich nun was kann ich tun

Howard Carpendale,"Ti Amo du sagtest Ti Amo das heißt ich lieb dich so
Was ist geblieben von deinem mich lieben
Von hundert Mal Ti Amo sagest du das nur so
Weil es dazu gehört Worte sind billig
Sind manchmal so billig

Man redet sich selber ein alles das muss so sein
Hast das auch du getan
Sinnliche Spiele und falsche Gefühle
Und nun willst du wieder ein neues Ziel finden
Willst dich nicht mehr an mich binden
Stehst da gepackt ist dein Koffer
Was gewesen ist gewesen

Dein Ti Amo dein schönes Ti Amo war nur Begleitmusik
Für Sommertage mehr kam nicht in Frage
Und ich hab geglaubt das mit uns geht so weiter
Jetzt bin ich leider gescheiter
Aber ich kann nicht bestreiten
Dass es schön war ja so schön war

So geh den Weg du hast ihn selbst gewählt
Wenn dich hier nichts mehr hält
Ich werde leben auch ohne dich leben
Und werden die Tage für mich noch so schwer sein
Werden die Nächte auch leer sein
Irgendwann werd ich vergessen
Es wird Schluss sein denn es muss sein
Du willst es so ich weiß du willst es so
Wann sagst du anderswo

Howard Carpendale,"Er stand im Rampenlicht, in der Hand die Gitarre
Grell geschminkt sein Gesicht, wild zerzaust seine Haare
Sonst war nichts mit ihm los Aber das merkte keiner
Er war ein Superstar – und nicht irgendeiner!
Seine Finger war\'n bunt Niemand sah seine Wunden
Bis auf Platz Nummer 1 hat er sich hoch geschunden
War die Stimme die sang auch der Schrei seiner Seele
niemals fiel je der Satz : „Seht doch, wie ich mich quäle!“

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

In ihm war alles leer Doch er merkte das schon
Er besang doch nicht sie sondern sein Mikrophon
Und die Boxen da hinten, die heulten wie wild
Und der Mann der da sang passte gar nicht ins Bild
Doch 10000 und mehr hat er hypnotisiert
Sein Gesicht nass vom Schweiß
Doch er fühlt nur, er friert
Und noch nachts im Hotel ist sein Tag nicht komplett
denn da wartet auf ihn irgendeiner im Bett

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

Ja, er hatte es geschafft Er sprang über den Zaun
Sein Gesicht so vernarbt durch die Träume der Frau\'n
Wie ein hungriges Tier, so verschlang er die Zeit
Nahm, was immer sich bot und war doch nie zu zweit
Und seine Welt war zu groß um ihm Heimat zu sein
Und für das, was er suchte war sie ihm zu klein
Eines Tages, da merkte er, dass nichts mehr lief
Und er fiel und er fiel in ein endloses Tief

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Howard Godfrey,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,2016
Howard Goodman,"The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now)
Now that I'm with you",With You,2000
Howard Goodman,"Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed

Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on

When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
And than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,2006
Howard Gospel Choir of Howard University,"1. There´s a battle cry being sounded near
By the royal army of the Lord.
Soldiers march to the rhythm of the Lord´s commands,
And this promise that is written in His word.

CHORUS:
We shall overcome, we shall triumph.
We shall stand in the victory as one.
Calvary´s hill´s been conquered by the Lord and King
So the victory is already won.

2. There are times so often in the battle´s rage
When the fighting will light the darkened sky.
That´s the time I focus on the Word of God
And can clearly read the final battle cry.

CHORUS: twice

Howard Griffin,"Well on the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot
Dan dropped in about five o'clock
Pulled off his coat, said ""The night is short.""
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart

And hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan got happy and he started raving
He jerked out his razor, but he wasn't shaving
And all the cats knew to jump and hop,
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried.""

The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
They all ran in to see what it was about
And I heard him holler when they led him away
He turned his head, and this is what he had to say

Hollered, ""Rave on children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
He let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
And through the black crossed bar he tossed a note to his dig
It said ""It ain't my fault, hun, that I'm in here""

But hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried

""It's almost dawn and the cops ain't gone,
And I've been Dixie fried",Dixie Fried,2000

And much too long since love's been here

Now I know there's many questions runnin' through your mind
You're wondering have you felt true love this time
Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there
I wrote this song just to ease your mind

They say in life you take a chance
And in love there's no guarantees
But the sweetest satisfaction comes from sharing our lives
And tearing down walls of mystery

What we share is special, it's mystical
There's magic when I look in your eyes
Oh, but this is no illusion, I never want to lose you
Say you'll be with me for the rest of my life, oh, girl

Was to love you and think of you with pride

Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry Mother's child is gonnna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

We can be one together

Don't you think now is the time
We should be feelin'
Just want to simply say
Won't let you slip away

People want to talk about the future
Don't want to linger on the past
Just want to reach to the real you inside
Forget cold glances and rejections
Leave the things that separate
Build on a trust that we can stand on

Howard Jones,"I've been waiting for so long
To come here now and sing this song
Oh Don't be fooled by what you see
Don't be fooled by what you hear, whoa

This is a song to all of my friends
They take the challenge to their hearts
Challenging preconceived ideas
Saying goodbye to long standing fears

Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains

I don't wanna be hip and cool
I don't wanna play by the rules
Not under the thumb of the cynical few
Or laden down by the doom crew

Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains

Don't crack up

Howard Jones,"I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind
Why should I mind, why should I mind

What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting",What Is Love?,1984
Howard Jones,"The lives were taken
For feasts at the table
A life of misery
Ending with a shock

Brutal murder (brutal murder)
All hands to the slaughter
Mass torture
All hands to the knife

And I can hear the screams
With the knife, the jolt, the wring
They must follow in our dreams
Carrying a twisted sting

Children's stories with their farmyard favourites
At the table in a different disguise

Don't talk to me of health
Or something someone else will do
We're talking about the act
Of taking life for me and you
And I hear their screams",Assault and Battery,1985
Howard Jones,"Please don't look at me this way
I am from the same seed as you
Take me back to the womb
I am weary of this life

Don't believe in my eyes
Don't believe in my mind
Don't believe in right or wrong
Don't believe in cruel or kind

But all this talk is only poetry
Only as true as we would believe
We must live to fight the negative
Not to court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh
In defeat oh oh oh oh

Oh the pain of life is sweet
Is it wrong to long for death?
Must I cling to the thrills of life
Ash to ash and dust to dust

But all this talk is only poetry
Only as true as we would believe
We must live to fight the negative
Not court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh
In defeat oh oh oh oh

You have looked at me this way
We are all from the same seed
Take us forward through the tomb
There's no finish to a life

Howard Jones,"Spare a thought for the souls
Who cannot leave this earth
The attachments bind so tightly, not a chance
Not a chance of a new birth

But the answer is no
Gripping their illusions
They cannot let them go

Hunger for the flesh
Leads them to a weaker heart
Mortals who imprisoned themselves
Let them have a new start

Wishing to hold onto life and all it's games
Singing their lament song
Holding back the change

They came here for to dance
To learn and not to cling
Holding onto life
As if it were the important thing

Hunger for security
Caught up in the mesh
Caught up for eternity

His knowledge would be tapped
The link was based on a respect
On their lives they would reflect
A perfect state of non-attachment
Was striven for and claimed as fact
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well
All his ideals were intact

Why look for the key in another
The answer lay in his own heart
Won't find yourself in some other
It always was there right at the start
But power it corrupted
That's where attachment starts
The power had erupted
The spell will crack
As each mental bond was broken
Strength grew in the young man's heart
What began as love not passion
Had left a seed in his heart

Why look for the key in another ...

With my old friend luke
And the strangest thing we saw
There was a flash like dynamite
And we fell down to the floor
And as we looked up this weird dude stood
I guess he was standing about four feet five
With a nonchalance and a joie de vivre
His face was grinning from side to side

Chorus
Well he said button up and tighten your lip
Keep a check on what you say
Those crazy words you fling from your mouth
Are going to bounce back on you some day

Now several years pass
I thought nothing more
It was down to a nine to five grind
I was shuffling round to my old friend's house
I had party on my mind
While chatting this chick
A guerilla muscled in
A brace of henchmen right behind
My blood boiled hard
I'll give you a piece of my mind
And this guy appeared by my side
Don't you know what he said

Chorus

I was walking down the street with my old friend luke
We were getting into a bit of a heavy scene
He say yes and I say no
He say what do you mean
I pulled my piece and he pulled his
We stared each other right in the eye
There was a flash like dynamite
And this guy appeared by our side

learnt to work with his hands
A million years passed by and his work was done
And his words were these...

everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything, 
everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you

With it's ups and it's downs, 
its rains and its sun
She decided that her work was done, 
time to have fun
and she found a game to play

Then as part of the game
She completely forgot where she'd hidden herself
And she spent the rest of her time

You should be thinking 'bout how to give your love instead
I've seen you lying and cheating your way
Then you complain about what all of your friends say

You shoot your mouth like you damn well own the world
We always have to keep our little white flags unfurled
Just try to finish the things that you start
Stop thinking with your fists
And start thinking with your heart

Oh can't you see
Oh what you could be now
You never listen to me
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world

Things have to be attempted one step at a time
You got to take that poison from your eyes
You know the lights are going out in your life
Your killing yourself with your own knife

Oh can't you see
Oh what you could be now
You never listen to me
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world

You don't want a love you need a chaperone
You want a first-class alibi
You bore the pants off people on the telephone
People are sick of your lies
You better open your eyes

You're like a gun turned on the world, like a gun

You're takin' one step forward then two steps back
Friendly advice gets treated like a heart attack
You can drown in the shallow water of hate
Get the sense before it's too late now

Oh can't you see
Oh what you could be now
You never listen to me
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world
Oh can't you see
Oh what you could be now
You never listen to me
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world
",Gun Turned on the World,1992
Howard Jones,"Give me one last try
Hold on for me
Believe my alibi
Keep strong
Don't set me free
Well this weakness makes me wrong
I'll show you I can be strong

And this time it is for real
I know the hurt I've made you feel
But I won't let you down
No one else would have me 'round
You gave your love so honestly
Is heaven's grace too good for me

I know I've pushed my luck
So many times
I'm slippin' slowly now
Loosin' track, of my mind
Well this shadow I've become
Will step out to meet the sun

And this time it is for real
I know the hurt I've made you feel
But I won't let you down
No one else would have me 'round
You gave your love so honestly
Is heaven's grace too good for me

And when the darkness comes
And I lose sight,
Of the precious world
That you put right
You've the strength to pull me through
One last try I'm asking you

And this time it is for real
I know the hurt I've made you feel
But I won't let you down
No one else would have me 'round
You gave your love so honestly
Is heaven's grace too good for me

Howard Jones,"We got the same beat runnin' round
Through this crazy town

We'd be shakin' the ground
She's sick and there's a way to bring her 'round

Show me what you're waitin' for
This moment may not rise again
And your heart will never know
Show me what you're waitin' for
The voices may not rise again
And the world will never know

The party drags us over the edge to a poison shore
I can't carry this desire anymore
Across the blue sky callin' me with the sweetest demand
She talks to me of mercy make me understand

Show me what you're waitin' for
This moment may not rise again
And your heart will never know
Show me what you're waitin' for
The voices may not rise again

And through these years 
As the tears chase the rain
The picture has cleared
Can we face the change

Howard Jones,"He saw flames in the department store
He tried to get the people to the safety of the door
There was no fire the voices were telling him what to do
You could see from his face he needs someone
To help pull him through

The voices are back they're telling him what to do
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

Ripping through the fabric between his world and the real
He's trying to protect you but
The knife will know that your flesh meets steel
Took him to an institution
And they helped the voices go away
But he didn't have the right set of papers
So they put this boy in jail

The voices are back they're telling him what to do
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

Six weeks turned to twelve
He was locked up for twenty-three hours a day
The warden found him in his cell
His only crime was that he was ill

The voices are back they're telling him what to do
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

I saw you standing there
Darlin' you were hungry for life, 
an innocent in this land

What is it about this city, 
that brings us all to life
Ten millions souls vibrating,
They're shimmering in the night

You mustn't think of staying,
The price is more than you'd think
It's giving up the sweetest part of you,
For this heartless prize

When does a vision of heaven 
become a living hell
Ten million souls vibrating, 
they're acting it out for real

Where do all the lonely people go,
When they want some lovin'
Where do all the lonely people hide, 
when they feel like cryin'

It was that night at nowhere, 
a cold glass in your hand
Darlin' you were angry with life, 
a prisoner in this land

They're shimmering in the night

Where do all the lonely people go,
When they want some lovin'
Where do all the lonely people hide, 
when they feel like cryin'
Where do all the lonely people go, 
in this crowded city
Where do all the lonely people hide, 
there's no sanctuary

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to handshake, nowhere to smile
Won't you talk with me
Spend some time and give me life
When does a vision of heaven 
become a living hell
Ten million souls vibrating
They're shimmering in the night

Where do all the lonely people go, 
in this crowded city
Where do all the lonely people hide, 
there's no sanctuary

Howard Jones,"He wasn't looking for a pretty face
She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV
She needed someone with an interior smile

She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

This is love worth waiting for
Something special, something pure

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

What is love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

No, don't look at the rain

They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery
And joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard

No, don't always look at the rain

Is in your smile again
Is in your life again

Was a time when love grew cold for you
Turned your back on memories

I was there for you
I will see you through
Darkest hours fade
The promises we made
Were not the kind to fade away
We'll face another day
We'll face another day
When that was yesterday

Will the ocean rollers bring you home
Or will they take you out to sea
This is real-time
And you are still mine

Breaks the cruelest schemes

A room of din and chatter

When the streetlights shine above

Safe in your arms
So simple to me
Safe in your arms
Oh so temporary
Safe in you arms
Oh so tenderly
Not one of the lonely tonight

Flying hectically
Through a cloud of buts and maybes
Passing frantically
Over nights and days unended

You turn my head and laugh
When my world turns sour
You give me strength to pass

",Not One of the Lonely Tonight,1997
Howard Jones,"What freezes love in your eyes
What steals the force from your life
What holds us ransom tonight
What stops you seeing yourself?
Only fear can stand
On potential's hands

This is the greatest day of your life
If you make it
And the old spells you know
They can be broken
Nothing to fear
Nothing to fear

The greatest faults can be beaten
The grandest problems defeated
Impossible choices completed
Infinite pain will be treated
Only fear can stand
On potential's hands

This is the greatest day of your life
And we made it
And the old spells you know
'cause they can be broken
Nothing to fear
Nothing to fear

This is the greatest day of your life
And we've made it
Break the old spells
Oh, let them be broken
Nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear

This is the greatest day

Break the old spells
Don't why'know they can be broken

Howard Jones,"Sleep my angel
It is time for bed
I will be there
To watch over you
I'll protect you from the world
And the voices in your head
I'll be with you
With my life I will defend
I'll be with you
I will be there in the end

And I'll cry your tears
As you feel every pain
Coax out the sun
From the endless rain
Thought I'd never feel
So much love for another
I'll be with you
I will be there in the end

Love that is there
Through the false and the real
Love that desires
No reward and no gain
As I hold your tiny hand
You'll never know how I feel
There's a promise
With my life I will defend
I will be there with you 'til the end

And I'll cry your tears
As you feel every pain
Coax out the sun
From the endless rain
Thought I'd never feel
So much love for another

Bursting inside
Let me help you on your journey
Let me help you with life

Howard Jones,"Heaven is a somewhere locked inside and I must find the key
Wish I'd never locked the door
Ordinary things in life are where this heaven likes to be
Hold the sky, feet on the floor
Hold the sky, feet on the floor

We make our sun to shine
We make our space and time
We make the weather
We make it change

Hell is not somewhere but a state of mind I choose to be
When my faith in life has gone
Cruelty rebounds to hurt itself puts shackles on the free
Vicious circle carries on
Hold the sky, feet on the floor

We make our sun to shine
We make our space and time
We make the weather
We make it change
We make the weather
We make it change

Time to judge the act don't judge the actor of the circumstance
Time to free compassion's world
Life is not the end we're passing through like bubbles on the sea
Time to learn and time to mend

We make the weather

On your wedding day
With the one you love
To share the way
A life ahead of you
Youth left behind
Go out and make yourself
Some memories

Faced at every turn
And there's children
To save from harm's way
Three thousand doorways
Reveal a thousand more
Treasure each moment
Forever more

I promise to love you and do my best for you
I need you to help me to find my strength
Walk with me all through my life
My lover my husband my wife
Share this journey with me
Write this story with me

Life comes and it will go
And there's no time to sit and watch the grass grow
When we are old and grey you know we'll say
We went and made ourselves some memories

We're starting our life
We're starting together now

I can't see land
Hiding out and biding it's time
Yet it's all around
Shimmering sun for day
Jealous moon will prey
On the mind of an unfulfilled soul

Life seems a moment away
Challenging and beckoning
Needing this freedom today
On the night when lovers confess

Chilling winds will blow through this heart
And won't let me rest
Matchwood bridges are doin' their best
To keep us apart
Love that was meant to be
Love that was sent to me
In the land of troubles and peace

Life seems a moment away

Howard Jones,"There were times when I thought there was nothin' in this world
There was nothin' in this world for me
Everywhere I looked there was trouble in my life
Trouble far as I could see
Hey there's a man doin' alright
What's his philosophy?
He come over here and whispered in my ear

You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary

So who am I so nervous and shy
To be brilliant and talented
It's the light not the dark that frightens us most
And the power lies in our head
You playin' small doesn't help at all
The world need the things you give
Switch yourself on, turn the pressure on

You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary

There are times when I think there's plenty in this world
There's plenty in this world for me
Anytime I see trouble in my life
It becomes an opportunity
Now there's a chance to make the world dance
You do it unconsciously
Help this Winter turn into Spring

You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary

Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow(in your heart and in your vein)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow(free your mind)
Did you ever make it stop?

Don't you part with it
I devoured it
You can work with it
You can part with it
Satisfaction guaranteed
Give'em folks what they need
What you need is indeed
A little funk from EV
Now hit me
Sounds so funky, you'd agree
Funky divas in 3-D
Let if flow
did you ever make it stop?
",What Can I Say?,2006
Howard Jones,"It's not my fault if you didn't live out your
Youthful dreams
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise

Chorus
When you cross that line, there's no turning back
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door

Everyone has got to take some responsibility
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare

I'm telling you when I say these words, that
They're not spoken in bitterness
That destructive emotion has long ago left
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me
Start afresh

When you cross that line, what more can I say
When you cross that line, we are no more
We are no more
",Cross That Line,2006
Howard Jones,"The throwing of your mental clothes wasn't ever your intention
The malady within your heart has no cure and prevention
There are those who move clouds
Those who move clouds
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd
Those who move clouds

I wish that I could offer you a chance to change direction
But you know that pathways must be followed to near destruction
There are those who move clouds
Those who move clouds
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd
Those who move clouds

There are those who will patronise and compromise your position
They can't feel the forceful hand of
Predetermined destination
There are those who move clouds
Those who move clouds
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd
Those who move clouds

I can feel the forceful hand
And it won't let me change direction no
And there's this hunger inside of me
And it won't and it won't no it won't stop it's aching
And I can feel it inside of my head the forceful hand
And it won't let me change direction
And there's this hunger and it won't let me
And it won't let me stop and it won't let me stop this aching no
",Those Who Move Clouds,2006
Howard Jones,"I've known you since you were a girl
When things just didn't work out for you
I said don't crack up and see both sides
But you kept on blaming the world for everything

I tried to tell you that you were in control
But you didn't seem to listen to a word I say
But I'm never giving up, giving up on you
I try to help you see the world in a different way

Now look me in the eye, now and tell me straight
Did you find it hard to tell me everything
I said things can only get better dear
But they won't if you don't lift a finger to help me

What's the point in taking this human form
If we can't understand the point of living here
Who would ever want to live alone
Without sharing this world with everyone and everything

Darlin' you were hungry for life, a prisoner in this land

What is it about this city, that brings us all to life
Ten millions souls vibrating
They're shimmering in the night

You mustn't think of staying
The price is more than you'd think
It's giving up the sweetest part of you
For this heartless prize

Nowhere a handshake, nowhere a smile
Won't you talk with me

He didn't want someone who walked straight off the tv

He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Was feeling so caged, hands tied
I can't find anything feeling so right, it's blinding hope

The Reaper is close, save a spot
A matter of time, can't deny
I won't try to run, run, run
This destiny's mine

I search for the edge of Earth
'cause that's the only place I'll ever find that makes me hope

It's out there waiting to ignite
the favor will rise, rise, rise
taking over my mind

I'm numb, I succumb when he renders

Like a butterfly caught in a shutter 
When he calls me his mate

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June

I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you

No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves

No Halloween
