Paul McCartney,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly, into the light of a dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free",Blackbird,1991

Paul McCartney,"To lead a better life, I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can, deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me I know I'd need never care
But to love her is to need her 

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me I know I'd need never care
But to love her is to need her 

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies

Paul McCartney,"Crash bang wallop, I'm a lover again
I've got my eyes on the road and I'm feeling no pain
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her

Bye bye, melancholy, listen to me
We had a long long ride
But it isn't to be
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her

Get out of my way, get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me how to be right
Don't try to stop me, I've got the answer

I won't need anybody except my woman tonight
I can't help it if I'm starting to smile
I've got a full gas tank and it's only a mile
'Til I'll be with my little woman
I'm ready to see her

So I say
Bye bye, melancholy, listen to me
We had a long long ride
But it isn't to be
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her

Get out of my way, get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me how to be right
Don't try to stop me, I've got the answer
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight

Paul McCartney,"Last night you helped me through, 
Took me to the lovers zone. 
I saw there, images 
Projected on a wall of stone. 
I stood inside Egyptian temples, 
I looked into eternal gardens, 
Lay on the shores of distant islands, 
Listening to the sea birds song of joy. 

Oh, I owe it all to you, 
You make me happy, 
Oh, I owe it all to you. 

Late last night, we were right 
Into some exotic scene. 
Everywhere, images 
Appearing on a giant screen. 
I stood inside a glass cathedral, 
I looked into the golden canyon, 
Lay by the lakes of holy water 
Glistening like a diamond in the light. 

Oh, I owe it all to you, 
You make me happy, 
Oh, I owe it all to you.",I Owe It All to You,1993

For you to sink so low. 
You must have had a ton of pressure. 
Only answer if the answer's no.

Doesn't take a lot to get off the ground. 

There must have been a lot of magic 
When the world was born. 
Let me be the one you wish for, 
One you call for, when you're all alone. 

I need loving, you need loving too. 
Wouldn't take a lot to get off the ground.

Hear the sound, hear the sound.

For a seed knows what a seed must know.

And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(take you anywhere)

But I love you endlessly
(loving we will share)

So come and go with me
To one town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover,

Paul McCartney,"How many days will the wet weather last? 
I want know will the clouds 
When they roll back 
Reveal a man in an old mac 
Living on a park bench 
Sitting on his own? 

Cut the rain as it runs down the glass 
Eventually through the lightning and thunder 
We see a man going under 
This is how it happens 
This is what he said 

I don`t need love 
Though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

Focus in on the breath of a man 
Who takes a brown paper bag 
From his knapsack 
Between his whispers and wise cracks 
He`s looking for permission 
Screaming at the sky 

I don`t need love 
though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

I`ll be right again 
Be upright without you 
I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 

Cut back again to a girl walking by 
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks 
Climb an invisible soap box 
Laughing at the traffic 
Shouting at the world 

I don`t need love 
though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 
I`ll be right again 
Be upright without you 

We see a life through the eyes of a man 
As he live and he dies 
By a simple tattoo 

I`ll be back again 
When I land on my feet 
I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again, wouldn`t you 

Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him 
It`s there on his face 
He`s a case where there`s clearly no hope 

Give me your hand again 
`Til I land again 

His face starts to fade 
As we pull down the shade 
And the picture we made 
Is in glorious cinema scope

You`re going to find out what it`s like
Just what it`s like, now you`re a mess
You wanted something you could never possess

You went your own way one too many nights
You treated her like some small oversight
What in the world makes her think that she can
Turn you from a playboy into a man

[Chorus]
She`s going to make you suffer tonight
To turn you from a playboy into a man
And when you`re worthy of her then she might
Turn you from a playboy into a man

You thought you were the answer to her prayers
The perfect gift that every girl prefers
But that`s the trouble `cos every girl still thinks you`re hers
So there you are with your gold chains jangling
Your lucky charms and jewelry dangling
But when she saw you she turned and ran
To turn you from a playboy into a man

[Chorus]
You couldn't see that the juvenile things you do
Would drag you down and now that the joke`s on you
You`re pretty cold you end as you start
When your facade isn't falling apart
So now you`re standing in your underwear
Well now you know just how it feels for her
You`re halfway there you know that she can turn you from a
Playboy into a man

What did I do to make her go
Why must she be the one
That I have to love
So like Candy

We were so happy then
But that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no not that again
But that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy

She couldn't say ""goodbye"", but ""I admire your taste""

She was counting out the window of the outbound train
All the poles of the telegraph
And the rock-a-bye rhythm in the song of the rails
Couldn't make the sweeper laugh

Down down down so deep
Down down drowning in his sleep
Tommy's coming home again

And a hawk hovered high above a skinny jackrabbit
Pursued by a hungry fox
And a broker awoke her from a fitful slumber
Then consulted his shares and his stocks

Down down down they go
Down down how he'll never know
Tommy's coming home again
And it's almost April fools' day

As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil (? )
He could see she was really upset
As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box
As he offered her a cigarette

Down down down she took a drag
Now he's covered in a flag
Tommy's coming home again
And it's almost April fools' day

Almost April fools' day
And the joke's on everyone
He had that premonition
Only dead men dwell upon

But how could he know that only twelve months later
She would wear her skirt up over her knee
And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses
And forget the tears of bigotry (? )

Down down down they flow
Now now now it just don't matter anymore
Tommy made it home again
When it was almost April fools' day

Almost April fools' day
And the joke's on everyone
He had that premonition
Only dead men dwell upon

Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Where they play the west coast sound

Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Shake some dust off of this old bus
I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day up on the motorway
Where the carburetors blast

Of your familiar song 

I tell you what I'm going to do 
I'll try to take my mind off you 
And now that you don't need my help 
I'll use the time to think about myself 

You're not aware 
Of what you put me through 
But now the feeling's gone 
But I don't mind 
Do what you have to do 
You don't fool anyone 

I'll tell you what I'm going to do 
I'll take a different point of view 
And now that you don't need my help 
I'll use the time to think about myself 

The definition of friendship 
Apparently ought to be 
Showing support for the one that you love 
And I was open to friendship 
But you didn't seem to have any to spare 
While you were riding to Vanity Fair 

There was a time 
When every day was young 
The sun would always shine 
We sang along 
When all the songs were sung 
Believing every line 

That's the trouble with friendship 
For someone to feel it 
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right 
And I keep hoping for friendship 
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there 
While you were riding to Vanity Fair",Riding to Vanity Fair,2005

I want to walk through your fire
Light up my eyes with your smile

I was alone in this world
Take me away from here

I've been shot from a gun
To your final embrace

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

How could they steal all these feelings?
How could they lie to this world?
A picture away from your smile

Life's being run at a blistering pace
I've been shot from a gun
To your final embrace

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

One soul displaced, one heart replaced
Feelings defaced, invade our space
No one left to give us back our time

Climb every mountain
Swim through every sea
When all the world is asleep
We could set ourselves free

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

We could climb every mountain
Swim through every sea
When all the world is asleep

Recover from the trip you've been on. 
I want to lie on the bed, 
Get you ready for my polygon. 
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it, 
Sweet banana, you've never been done. 
Yes, I go like a rabbit, gonna grab it, 
Gonna do it 'til the night is done.

There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
And a far, far better world

Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits her with a plan

Music and fun
Nights out for dancing
And the days for the sun

And together they will steal the show

He has to cancel
'Cause they got him working late

Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dream begins to fade

Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Light's out for sleeping
If a girl's to get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
But they'll be together
And together they will make it through

Our danger's up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's real said

It feels that there's a good chance
That we've been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

What can we do, what can we do
What can we do to stop
This foolish plan going through
What can we do, what can we do
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew

Despite repeated warnings
From those who are to know
Well, he's got his own agenda
And so we'll go

We shout the loudest
We'll not always be the smartest
But they have their promised moments
Right before they fall
Red sky in the morning
Doesn't ever seem to face him
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern his soul

How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it, we can save the day

The engineer is with his wife and daughter Janet
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet
They'll never want him to go
He had a premonition
He said that something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy but he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him if we don't do something soon to stop him

How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it, we can save the day

No brakes, the engineer cries
The cabin's gonna leak, that's when the temperatures rise
The heat is going up, the engine's gonna blow
And we're gonna be left down below, down below

Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now

And that'd be so fine for the wife and Janet
Sometimes you might have to battle through it
But that's the way you learn how you got to do it

Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it

Despite repeated warnings
Our danger's up ahead
While the captain wasn't listening
To what was said

So we went to the captain
And told him to turn round
But he laughs in our faces
Says that we are mistaken
So we gather around him
And everyone stood around him
Oh, but he should have listened

Where they play the west coast sound

Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Upon his flute - toot toot toot toot

Upon the dirty ground of London Town

People pass me by on my imaginary street
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet
Holding conversations that are always incomplete
Well, I don't know
Oh, where are there places to go
Someone somewhere has to know
I don't know

Out of work again the actor entertains his wife
With the same old stories of his ordinary life
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife
Well, I don't know

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Back in '92 there were love affairs, with a sidelong stare, and you caught them all
Back in Leavenworth you would pray that I'd wait

But I never told a soul that I'd stay
That I'd wait
Would you trade in the days? 
All you ever were was an oddity

You were lost in me, and I was so confused
But looking back I see this is how it was, and always will be, forever",Wait,2006
Paul Michiels,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be. 
And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be",Let It Be,

Why should my heart feel lonely and long for a heavenly home

His eye is on the sparrow and I know he cares for me
His eye is on the sparrow and I know God watches over me
I sing because my soul is happy and I sing because I'm free

Je chante sur mon chemin
Je chante, je vais de ferme en château
Je chante pour du pain je chante pour de l'eau

Tourmente mon appétit

Je défaille en chantant et je meurs à moitié
Et gendarmes, qui passez sur le chemin
Gendarmes, je tends les main
Pitié, j'ai faim, je voudrais manger

The last embrace, the final touch
With nothing more to say

As silence fell around the bridge
Not a single word was spoken
A bitter breeze, a lonely stream
Echoed through the Glen
Echoed through the Glen

In forlorn hope we wait for
Distant hills still haunt us now

Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

A heavenly nest,

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

Paul Nelson,"Hello my friend sure has been awhile
I don't know where the time has gone 
But I really missed your smile it's been too long
I got so much to say that I don't know where to start
Ever since we went our seperate ways 
Been a big hole in my heart.
As I recall it was you that said goodbye
Now you're asking me to give it one more try.
 
Only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
And so my friend I hope you understand 
It's hard to put my trust in you 
'Cause i'm afraid you'll leave me again
I want to believe thatcha fin'ly seen the light 
That you miss my love and you want to make it right
 
But only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
Got no way of knowin' what the future's gonna bring
So I'll just listen to my heart 
Because it's never lied to me and what I left to be
Only time will tell if you're gonna stand beside me 
Through both heaven and hell I want to know if you're behind me 
Only time will tell 
What we have together gonna last forever
Hoo time will tell do you believe in me?
Only time will tell if we're gonna be together woa'
I wanna love that last forever",Only Time Will Tell,2005

Paul Nicholas,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.

(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Paul Nicholas,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High Flying, Adored",1997

Paul Nicholas,"The greatest magicians have something to learn
From mister mistoffelees' conjuring turn
And we all say
Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister Mistoffelees
Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister Mistoffelees

He is quiet he is small he is black
From his ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail

He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice
He can play any trick with a cork

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone
You find it next week lying out on the lawn

And we all say
Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister mistoffelees
Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister mistoffelees

His manner is vague and aloof
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire

And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
(At least we all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours
When he was asleep in the hall

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat

And we all say
Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister Mistoffelees

Wind blows revealing a frozen tear upon my face
Black crows are guarding, a grave up to now that's had no name

Paul Oakenfold,"'I believe with the advent of acid. We discovered new ways to think and it has to do with piecing together new thoughts of mind. Why is it that people are so afraid of it? What is it about it that scares people so deeply? Because they are afraid that there is more to reality than they have ever confronted. That there are doors that they are afraid to go in and they don't want us to go in there either because if we go in, there we might learn something that they don't know. And that makes us a little out of their control.'",LSD,1995

Sparks a fire within my sould

And that was the crime that history will burn on his memory as a brand. 
By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, 
By fleeing the White House like a diseased cure, 
Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream""",Nixon's Spirit,2002

Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love, life, live
Come play the game, our world is free
Do what you want but scream

We know a place where the nights are hot
It is a house of funk, females and males
Both headed all for the disco
The D.J. plays your favorite blasts
Takes you back to the past, music's magic, poof
Bump, bump, bump, get bump with some flash, people

(Rock, rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop)
(Rock, rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop)

Out Of My Dreams
Last night you were here again, third time this week
You always slip in when I'm asleep
I thought those old feelings would be long gone by now
Why in the world do you bother to come back around
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life
Out of every thought
That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes
That it might be you every time the telephone rings
But will I ever get you out of my dreams
There we were making wishes on evening stars
Promises sealed with kisses straight from our hearts
But then I woke up to reality again
Even the sweetest dreams come to an end

Paul Overstreet,"To me she is a beauty queen 
I love to watch her on the screen 
In our home movies 
And when she sings around the house 
She's got a voice that knocks me out 
She is my favorite singer 

But you won't see her on T.V. 
Or hear her on the radio 
Worldly fame is not her aim 
And she's the first to let you know 

CHORUS: She wants to be a homemaker 
It's her dream to raise a family 
And give her love to just one man 
And I thank God it's me 
I'll never underestimate her 
'Cause she could take this word and turn it on 
But she takes her love 
And makes our house of home 

She can't afford to spend her day 
In a old soap opera haze 
She's much too busy 
At night she puts the kids to bed 
She's makin' sure their prayers get said 
Before she lays down with me 

It's plain to see 
That she's not seeking glory on this earth 
'Cause she believes in honesty 
And the joy of giving birth 

(REPEAT CHORUS)",Homemaker,1989
Paul Overstreet,"I guess we must have met somewhere
That you were not around
I can't remember why I fell
Why I did not turn her down

But then I thought about you
And my heart began to cry
Because I knew how it would hurt you
And your trust in me would die

And somewhere through the darkness
Came a Little stream of light
That opened up my eyes
And washed away the night
Then I saw it was you
Who had been holding me tight

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up
That it all went away

I was dreading to tell you
That your man had been unfaithful
I was so glad that I was dreaming
When I went astray

I told you all about it
And you helped me understand
Sometimes we learn from dreaming
And thank God that we can

'Cause that's one lesson
I don't want to have to learn again

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up
That it all went away

I was dreading to tell you
That your man had been unfaithful
I was so glad that I was dreaming
When I went astray

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up

When I went astray",I'm So Glad I Was Dreaming,1991
Paul Overstreet,"Looking back I clearly see
Where I was better off
One wrong turn, then before I knew it,
I was lost.

Some say I was lead astray
But I'm the one to blame
I'm just glad I found my way
Back to this little road again.

I gotta keep walking
Down the straight and narrow
Those winding roads are hard
On your heart and hard up on your shoes

Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose

There's temptation on the left
There's temptation on the right
If you need a little help,
Keep your eyes upon the light

Keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues
If you want to save yourself a world of sorrow
The straight and narrow is the road to choose.

Well I know you've heard of greener pastures
Just beyond the hill
Once you've turned the corner
You'll find its a package deal
There may be good times now and then
But the truth be known
Just a trick to keep you lff the path that leads you home

Better keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow.
Those winding roads are hard
Upon your heart and hard up on your shoes.
Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose.

There's frustration on the left,
And aggravation on the right.
And it will worry you to death
So if you value your life
You better keep on walking down
The straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues

If you want to save yourself
A world of sorrow
The straight and narrow
Is the road to choose.

The straight and narrow is the only road you should use.",Straight and Narrow,1991

Daddy used to go out every night with his friends
And Mama stayed home taking care of the kids
Daddy didn't mind the way it was arranged
To his way of thinking, it didn't seem strange

Then one night Mama met him at the door

Mama said more than the locks have changed
There's a new set of rules to this old game

But Daddy don't seem to mind at all
Come straight home when the work day's through
He's even done the dishes a time or two

And late last night when the lights were low
Daddy told Mama, ""I love you so""

""You just might get to be a Daddy again""

Paul Overstreet,"I use to love to walk behind my daddy
As he plowed our garden every spring
Our little bare feet in the dirt would make me happy
As we talked about what harvest time would bring

He'd say son this whole world is like a garden
And what you sow your surely gonna reap
Where bitter seeds are planted hearts will harden
But a caring hand will make the harvest sweet

And he was sowin' love for the family
Yeah, he was sowin' love, he took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest

Workin' with her needle and her thread
So patiently she'd listen to our problems
And we knew she heard every word we said

She'd say, ""Children this old world is full of scratches
And in your life your bound to have a few""
I guess that's why the good Lord gave us patches
So we could start each day out feelin' new

I set it on the table and I talked to it till four

He just told me so last night (Johnny loves her)
Now each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright (Johnny loves her)

Johnny's heart is really mine (Johnny loves her)
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine
I feel so pretty, I'm all aglow
When he says I'm wonderful
He makes me feel it's so
Yes, Johnny loves me
Now each day is bright and new (Johnny loves her)
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
""Johnny loves me and I love my Johnny, too""

Paul Petersen,"Ronnie, I know that you're mad at me
So I'm writing this note to ask you please
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
There's something I just have to say
I wasn't flirting with Jim
When you saw me with him
I could never hurt you that way

So, Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
And give me a chance to explain
You saw me talking to Joe
But I want you to know
Every other word was your name

You saw me with some of your buddies
And that was careless of me
Everything went wrong
When you came along and saw
What you weren't supposed to see

So, Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
So you can get everything right
I only met with the guys
Just to plan a surprise
For your birthday, Saturday night

My dad, now here is a man.
To me he is ev'rything strong; no he can't do wrong, my dad.
My dad, now he understands when I bring him troubles to share; 
Oh, he's always there, my dad.
When I was small I felt ten feet tall. 
When I walked by his side
And ev'ry one would say, ""that's his son,"" 
and my heart would burst with pride.
My dad, oh, I love him so,
And I only hope that some day my own son will say,

Paul Peterson,"Gray skies are gonna clear up,
Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!
Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!
And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face
And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine
I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing
So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face",Put On a Happy Face,2004

De vous laisser parler d’amour
Gens du pays, c’est votre tour
De vous laisser parler d’amour

Le temps que l’on prend pour dire Je t’aime
C’est le seul qui reste au bout de nos jours
Les voeux que l’on fait, les fleurs que l’on sème
Chacun les récolte en soi-même
Au beau jardin du temps qui court

Gens du pays, c’est votre tour
De vous laisser parler d’amour
Gens du pays, c’est votre tour
De vous laisser parler d’amour

Le temps de s’aimer, le jour de le dire
Fond comme la neige aux doigts du printemps
Fêtons de nos joies, fêtons de nos rires
Ces yeux où nos regards se mirent
C’est demain que j’avais vingt ans

Gens du pays, c’est votre tour
De vous laisser parler d’amour
Gens du pays, c’est votre tour
De vous laisser parler d’amour

Le ruisseau des jours aujourd’hui s’arrête
Et forme un étang où chacun peut voir
Comme en un miroir l’amour qu’il reflète
Pour ces coeurs à qui je souhaite
Le temps de vivre leurs espoirs

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you
