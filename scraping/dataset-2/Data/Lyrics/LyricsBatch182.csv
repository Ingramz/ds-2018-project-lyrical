Dvicio,"Era lo bonito del mar, cuando estás a mi lado no hay otro lugar
Y era lo bonito de ser un par de enamorados
Era lo bonito de ti, tú nunca te rendiste hasta verme feliz
Y es lo más bonito saber que nunca me has fallado

Ahora sé que es fácil decir que te olvidé
Que lo nuestro nunca existió, que te fallé
Todo ocurrió mal y tu error se vino del revés

Siento que hoy te quiero más de lo normal
Por primera vez el dolor es vertical
Se hace cuesta arriba el tiempo cuando tú no estás

Enamórate, te, te, otra vez
Quiero recordarte que bonito es verlo
Todo en una nube del color del cielo

Te, te, te, otra vez
Bajar a la tierra y tocar con los dedos
El agua del mar, tu cuerpo con mi cuerpo

Era lo bonito del sol, siempre brillaba más y hacía más calor
Era el día más bonito si estabas conmigo
Era lo bonito de hoy, que es nuestro aniversario y esperando estoy
Y hasta me conformaría con ser sólo amigos

Ahora sé que es fácil decir que te olvidé
Que lo nuestro nunca existió, que te fallé
Todo ocurrió mal y tu error se vino del revés

Siento que hoy te quiero más de lo normal
Por primera vez el dolor es vertical
Se hace cuesta arriba el tiempo cuando tú no estás

Enamórate, te, te, te otra vez
Quiero recordarte que bonito es verlo
Todo en una nube del color del cielo

Te, te, te, otra vez
Bajar a la tierra y tocar con los dedos
El agua del mar, tu cuerpo con mi cuerpo

Sigue enamorándote, sigue persiguiéndolo
Si el impulso viene de tu corazón
Como el aire que no ves, que se mete en tu interior
Pase lo que pase siempre seré yo quien te va a querer

Enamórate, te, te, otra vez
Quiero recordarte que bonito es verlo
Todo en una nube del color del cielo

Te, te, te, otra vez
Bajar a la tierra y tocar con los dedos
El agua del mar, enamórate",Enamorate,2014
Dvicio,"Aquí estoy solo, recuperándome,
De tu partida, y no vas a volver.
Sabor amargo, latido sin compás,
Noche de llantos, y ya no aguanto más.
Y ya no entiendo dónde fuiste,
Ya no entiendo porqué ya no estás
Y te vas

Justo ahora, que empiezo a quererte, te desapareces.
Justo cuando tú eras el motor para mi despertar.
Justo a tiempo para reprocharte que no me mereces
Aunque muera por las ganas de volver a caminar,
Junto a ti

Un día largo, no quiere terminar,
Porque se aleja, de ti cada vez más.
Y no lo entiendo
¿En donde estuve mal?
Para perderte, y de ti no saber más
Y ya no entiendo dónde fuiste,
Ya no entiendo porqué ya no estás
Y te vas

Justo ahora, que empiezo a quererte, te desapareces.
Justo cuando tú eras el motor para mi despertar.
Justo a tiempo para reprocharte que no me mereces
Aunque muera por las ganas de volver a caminar,
Junto a ti
Junto a ti
Junto a ti
Junto a ti
Y no encuentro una mejor manera,
De decirte esto no es porque yo quiera,
Que si esto es un sueño
Yo quiero despertar.
Y te busco, pero no te encuentro,
En cada amanecer, en cada pensamiento,
Siento que te alejas, y cada día más

Justo ahora, que empiezo a quererte, te desapareces.
Justo cuando tú eras el motor para mi despertar.
Justo a tiempo para reprocharte que no me mereces
Aunque muera por las ganas de volver a caminar
Justo ahora, que empiezo a quererte, te desapareces.
Justo cuando tú eras el motor para mi despertar.

Dvicio,"Despiértame mañana
Hoy ya no tengo ganas de nada más
Tu olor sigue en mi cama
Han sido tantas noches que recordar
Una mirada fría
Haciéndonos creer que todo irá bien
Mil lágrimas perdidas
Se esconden sentimientos bajo la piel
Y que me quema y me envenena
Y está matando, está matándome

Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas, nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, si nadie hace nada, nada

Quizá sea la distancia
La que me obliga hoy a pensar en ti
O el tiempo que no pasa
O el que debí pasar más cerca de ti
Y cada noche a oscuras
Quiero sentir tu respiración
Yo quiero que me digas
Que esto que yo siento no se terminó
Y que me quema y me envenena
Y está matando, está matándome

Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas, nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, si nadie hace nada, nada, oh

Oh
Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas, nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, si nadie hace nada, nada

Y ya no tengo nada, no
Camino por la calle y voy mirando nada
Cómo encontrar calor
Al lado de mi cama oh, no, no, no
Cómo decirte ya que sin ti no soy nada

Soy nada
Soy nada
Soy nada",Nada,2014
Dvicio,"Tu padre no me quiere ni un minuto al mes
Tu madre te prohíbe la palabra Andrés
No hay flores para ella o vino para él
Y no hay cara que ponga que le siente bien

Hay algo que no sabe, déjeme explicar
Cuanto más le prohíba, más le va a gustar
Y cambien esa cara de perro al pasar
Me voy volando con su hija a otro lugar

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
Es el paraíso
Donde todo lo hago contigo

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
En el paraíso
No hay nada como estar contigo

Perdone que le diga que no puedo estar

Sin besar a su hija ni un segundo más
La boca se me seca y todo me va mal
Me pierdo entre la gente
Y no encuentro el compás

Es algo tan absurdo que no sepa ver
Que ya no es una niña
Ahora es una mujer
Pensaba que era fácil pararle los pies
Pero se ha ido volando al paraíso Andrés

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
Es el paraíso
Donde todo lo hago contigo

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
En el paraíso
No hay nada como estar contigo

Yo sé que usted es su papá
Que no pensamos igual
Pero su hija ya entro en el paraíso ideal

Y cuéntale a tu mamá
Que ya se va acostumbrar
A verme más por aquí
Tocar la puerta al entrar

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
En el paraíso

Mi paraíso
Es tu paraíso
En el paraíso
No hay nada como estar contigo

Si usted no entiende mis formas
Sáltese un poco las normas
Ni a mí ni a nadie le importa
Este es el paraíso Andrés

Y si no encuentra manera
De respirar, no se muera
Su hija vuela en primera
Destino paraíso Andrés",Paraiso,2014
Dvicio,"Dice que es la niña más feliz del mundo
Brilla su sonrisa un poco más que ayer
Va contando horas segundo a segundo
Todo por besarlo, por estar con él

La temperatura sólo sube y sube
""Cuando estás conmigo me quiero morir""
Tiene la cabeza metida en las nubes
Y le pide por favor ""quédate aquí""

Con diecisiete años tan enamorada
Cómo imaginar que un día vendría así
Y cada noche lo consulta con su almohada
Que nunca tuvo tantas ganas de vivir

Que hoy soy feliz, por ti, por ti
Gracias a ti, soy más feliz
Hoy soy feliz por ti, por ti
Gracias a ti, feliz

Pásame a buscar en menos de una hora
Quítate la ropa, llegara al final
Llévame contigo hasta romper las olas
La temperatura sube un poco más

Con diecisiete años tan enamorada
Cómo imaginar que un día vendría así

Que hoy soy feliz, por ti, por ti

Si no estás, mi vida si no estás
No encuentro la manera de vivir, si tú no estás
Si te vas, la vida queda atrás

Dvicio,"Adiós, adiós
Ya me despido sin tener explicación
Ya lo que diga o lo que haga está de más
Se apaga el fuego de este amor

Y aquí me encuentro, en esta habitación tan llena de recuerdos
Voy despegando de mi corazón tu foto en mi pared
Un corazón que ya no siente nada, un corazón de hielo
Que te dejó las heridas abiertas y después se fue

No llores más amor, no llores más por mí
Porque no me lo merezco
Y acuérdate mi amor, y acuérdate de mí
Y que no nos sobre el tiempo

Adiós, adiós
Ya me despido sin tener la solución
A tus problemas o a tu vida
Ya que más da, si lo que opine está de más

""¿Y si me extrañas, vendrás a buscarme?"" preguntas con miedo
Si no me atrevo a contestarte a eso es porque no lo sé
Porque ya siento que estoy destrozando lo que más quería
Y algo por dentro me cierra la boca y me para los pies

No llores más amor, no llores más por mí
Porque no me lo merezco
Y acuérdate mi amor, y acuérdate de mí
Y que no nos borre el tiempo

No llores más amor, no llores más por mí
Porque no me lo merezco
Y acuérdate mi amor, y acuérdate de mí

Dvicio,"Todo en esta casa me recuerda a ti
Tu mirada escrita en la pared
Duermo en nuestra cama y tú lejos de mí
Me pregunto si ahora estás con él

Desde que tú no estás no sé ni qué hora es
Las luces se me apagan, todo me da vueltas, no me siento bien
Desde que tú no estás en mi contestador
No queda ni un mensaje que me de esperanza al escuchar tu voz

Y ahora que ya no estás todos me hablan de ti
Y te prometo que voy a reventar si no sales de mí

Y todavía no sé qué decir
Son tus amigas, tu familia, tu hermana
Que no quieren que te acerques a mí

Que alguien le ha dicho que han oído, que se habla
Siempre de todo menos bien de mí
Pero yo sé que tú te mueres de ganas
Que al fin y al cabo es lo que importa aquí

¿Por qué se meten en nuestro espacio?
Somos rebeldes, descontrolados

Quiero ver si el ritmo de tu corazón
Suena igual cuando sientas esta canción
Quiero ser aquel error que te marcó
Por saber que nunca podrá ser mejor

Quedan dos horas para verte en mi cuarto
Y hacer todo este sueño realidad
Todo mi cuerpo contigo lo comparto
Ya tú decides por dónde empezar

Ve poco a poco, que esta noche no hay prisa
Por fin llegó la hora de la verdad
En la mañana te pones mi camisa
Comerte a besos pa' desayunar

You did what Simon said
Doing what you feel

Humpty-Dumpty why'd you fall

Now we've solved this mystery

Three seconds is all I take
Three seconds of pure disaster
Two hits to blow me away
Three seconds you'll burn in hellfire
Three seconds you'll fall in love
Three seconds you won't go slowly
Three seconds is almost up
Three seconds of bumpin' clangin'
Three seconds of wasted youth
Three seconds there's no denying
This thing that's coming to you
Three seconds the pain and pleasure
Three seconds the morning light
Three seconds is simply forever

But I ain't trippin'
Cause these are the '90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin' like this

I say baby, why you want to do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin' in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you want to wake me up?
When I told you once I don't want to fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin to sleep, so just leave me alone

Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our Benz
Get somethin' that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin' like these groupie hoes
And since Tony Toni Ton?made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it

Lookin' at the bed, askin' am I ready

We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my sky pager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, cause I got friends
It's goin' down like always

Dwayne Tryumf,"I know a lot of people out there scared they're gon' die
A couple of them thinking they'll be livin' in the sky
But while I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why, what am here fo' I gotta figure out
Waste my life no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 12: 15 down to 21
You've really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we've wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' to show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living
To get a minute of any women and men that you admire
It ain't no lie

We're created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and he raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrects Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my life
Then I lost my rights
I lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that would cost that price.

So the devil just can't hang with us
Christian youth them will stand with us
Living and driven, given a vision, fulfillin' the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles, the rap evangelist
My daddy wouldn't abandon us
I gotta backpack full of tracts and I keep it on the Johnny Mac
So are you ready to jam with us
So let's go, give me the word an let's go
Persecution let's go
Tribulation let's go
Across the nation let's go
Procrastination let's go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows how many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in to get them

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life

Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
You're trying to figure what to do with your life
If you make a lot of money hope you're doing it right
Because the money is God's you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The colour your skin, naw you're a Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money start living for a car
Get 'em a wife a house kids and a dog
Then they retire they're living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in a mall
Your money your singleness marriage talent your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is Divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around Him He's the life in my lines
I refused to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time 'cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights

I could reach nirvana tonight

And devote his attention to me

But I said look here brother

Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

The mystery man got nervous and he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
And he whipped out a shaving kit
Now I thought it was a razor
And a can of foaming goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo
He said you might not believe this, little fella
But it'll cure your asthma too

Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

And you can't help me out
So, take your meditations and your preparations
And ram it up your snout
But I got the crystal ball, he said
And held it to the light
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then
As long as he was hanging around
I said the price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down

Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?

So you was my lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights

After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love
'cause I was young, I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I, I

I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love

Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that
Can't we just slow down a minute and talk it out?

I've been through my share of love since then
Don't know about what you've been through
But nothin' compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back and I know that you need me back

It never stopped me from girl thinkin' 'bout your body

Thinkin' to myself the lord must've blessed me many times
I wrote many verses girl, many lines about you and me,
Us together intertwined.
On some serious shit,
Girl you got a nigga st-stuttering.
Got me on some long term thinkin' other than.
On some diamond ring shit.

Spending tour money on you girl I don't mind.
But it's been a minute girl, you been on my mind.
Call me.

Yellin', niggas could hear us through the walls and the bricks
Sayin' what we don't mean
Stabbin' each other in the heart through the back
And actin' like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight

I might be forced to leave game alone

It hurts to the touch

You burning pimp my game

No captain save her, my moor dawdle goings
The genie in a bottle, lucky sevens that hit the solid coins
That's all I was, tipping my frame, had a different dip or a dame
Trip over game till they fall in love, had pretty women kiss the ring

Pecking the kicks, bet I'm convinced
I'm everything they wished and dreamed
You was more than just a fish on string
Earned a crown that was fit for queens, you a fix for feens

Know what I mean? Got a dude sick to spleen
Type a girl that could pose for king
(Listen, listen)
You got a body let me pick your brain
Get with dude, get this fame
Ditch your man, shake that lame

Come and take exotic trips
And exclusive whips with the premium bang
Hitting the autobahn, got us shifting lanes
Swear to God, just keep doing your thing
Just
(My lover, keep on)
Keep on

Got me in love with you, I'm telling me
All the things you can do for me
To bring my change when you buy my money
I cop the range and now you ride with me

You doing things that make me wanna keep the range
Parked outside when the sun's high
And I love the range but I can't lie
(You've got me higher)

Than I've ever been with any other woman

Might see this pimping change if you keep on

Doing your damn thing, my lover, keep on
Making me sing this song about you

You got me from them things you do
Baby, when you do what you do, when you put it on me
You've got me finding myself going crazy
I'm on my way to leaving this game alone if you keep on

Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the livin' room with all of they guns drawn
Out and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is

I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cell phone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six pack of O'Douls and some soul food

Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone

Ropes made bruises on his light skinned ass
See, I can play games too
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to

Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck man, we grew up together
Run DMC, tougher than leather

With the same outfits, forty deuce
Takin' flicks like what, shit
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man

I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everythin' you imagined? Was it perfect?

Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away

Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love and cherish but
Death did us apart, what a coincidence
Now, perhaps the police will be convinced

That it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker trespassin' up my residence
And to believe those vile set a precedence
From the start I should have been obvious, I never did

Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art

And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
365 days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry but slowly you try, so slowly you die

Buried alive in the grave, too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
Old friend of mine she sleepin' with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times

And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishin' checks and royalties
She's thinkin' it's true love, he's scammin' her for the quop
? to devise my own intuitive plot

Put the pros on him, launched the probe on him
Now harm him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted

Guess who you're 'bout to murder tonight?
Miss pretty brown eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib, you'll find under the mat
In the front of the house, just do it, word out

You told me never ever
Send roses you would rather
Me send them to the other

You asked me who I wanted

You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war

They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The light, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
For long

And I'm in love with the lights, the love,
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old!
Table full of new hoes, champagne Nouveau,
But my money is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto.
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend,
Know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends,
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I make Cali
But I just hide my face doing Errol Flynn
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in him,
She got no companion, she Jenifer Aniston,
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend!
And again, and again,
Pass it to my to my mans and them
Fuckin' all the baddest bitches in cities we landing in
But what happens when it all falls,
And the success, is all gone, and its all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity

They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

With the money they said that is the root of all evil,
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us,
But he ain't pass around that collection plate,
'Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through

Now hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get a Benz to
Man how is it the root of all evil
If it could take my whole family out to Rio
No more repo with a D-Bo, just speedboats, jewelry all gold
Call me C 3 P O
Smoke so much, I gotta see three PO's
I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mikes like Tito
So I would hate to lose my Mike like Tito

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2002
Dwight Lenox,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2002
Dwight Lenox,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Set my feet back on the ground

The whole damn world looks distant now
But I can't seem to put no space
Between my cold heart and your sweet face

Revealing brand new wedding bands
But our sweet gold, it's gone to rust
Now my life has turned to dust

I get the urge to travel, that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I gotta move along

Bye, bye, so long, there's something down the track

I'll only leave you cryin'
In the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me, I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feelin' blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home to pack
And kiss my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track

Or it can come from this bottle

About the evils of being drunk with wine
I don't care how the doctor might warn me
?Cause since you left, it?s just a matter of time

Death can come from this broken heart

Hey, bartender, I think I?ll hit the throttle

I don't care that my friends have all left me
?Cause they swear that I have gone insane
And I don't care anymore about livin?
Without you, just the grave can ease the pain

Dwight Yoakam,"She wore red dresses with her black shining hair
She had my baby and caused me to care
Then coldly she left me to suffer and cry
She wore red dresses and told such sweet lies

I never knew him but he took her away
And on my knees like a madman for vengeance I prayed
While the pain and the anger destroyed my weak mind
She wore red dresses and left the wounded behind

I searched til I found them, then I cursed at the sight
Of their sleeping shadows in the cold neon light
In the dark morning silence I placed the gun to her head
She wore red dresses, but now she lay dead",Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room (She Wore Red Dresses),1988

The six children he raised are all weepin'
For this soft-spoken mountain man
Who fed them with the money he earned in those black mines
And the food he could raise with his hands

Though the world knew nothing of his wisdom
Or the honest and simple things he did
There's some folks cryin' on this hillside today
That know about the humble way he lived

Though his presence in my memory is plain
You know that I'd swear that I just saw him walkin' up that hill

The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
I sang Dixie as he died

He said way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street
he drew a dying breath
laid his head against my chest
Please Lord take his soul back home to Dixie

I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie as he died

He said listen to me son while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see what life here has done to me
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp against my side
No more pain, now he's safe back home in Dixie

I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes

No,  never lie to you, yeah

Hey little girl, you don't have to hide nothin' no more,
Oh, you didn't do nothin' that hasn't been done before.

Little girl thought she wouldn't get caught, you see,
She thought she's get away with goin' out on me.

Oh, other girls do it, you didn't think of nothin' new,
You went out on me, so what, other girls do too.

You can leave little girl, 'cause I don't want you around no more,
And if you come knockin' you won't get past my door.

Oh, you got nothin' to hide and everybody knows it's true,
Too bad little girl 'cause it's all over for you.

Dwight Yoakam,"Night wolves moan
Winter hills are black
I'm all alone
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Headlights shine
Highway fades to black
It's my last ride
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
I ain't never coming back
In a long white Cadillac

In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac

Ah, bye bye baby
I'm gonna take this white trash
On down the road

She'll never come back to me
This much I know

This much I know

This much I feel
I should have reached out to her
This much I feel
I tried it too late
This much I feel
How empty the world can be
And so painfully real
This much I feel

I've had second thoughts about
Every reason
We let love slip away
From our lives
And there's no place left to look
That I don't see some
Small reminder
Of all the chances
I just let go by

This much I need
To wake up once and find she's not gone
This much I need
But I'll never have
This much I need
Words to speak without missing her
Or just some new way to breathe
This much I need

As I watch it moving past
Than any other hope that I might hold that someday you
Might know what it's like to slowly drown

Waiting for the the thought to cross your mind that 2 hearts might
Be inclined to commit an act that's bold
Or even just be looking for a chance to take advantage of
One glance and live inside it one more time
Waiting for the thought to cross your mind
How long will it be
'Til these blind eyes can finally see
I don't know, time goes so slow
While your love, like a river, flows right by me

But you're still digging in the mind
And your staring out the window
Saying everything will be just fine

No matter what angle you get
It's polished till it shines

Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too

And when you say who the hell am I living with
What just went down
Where did this come from
Why are all my colors faded brown
When did it change
What's with the rage
Who's the dude with the extrall
What's the verse the line the chapter the page

Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it

You think you're lost without any place left to go
Like you need one of those kisses long and slow
First glance is not what it seems

Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream
You take a guess

Warm afternoons turn rainy
Dark and cruel

A candle's glowing light will die
The purest voices often lie
And with love I've found
That all the same is true

I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool

But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch, don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule

Sweet dreams can't be recalled
High hopes collapse and fall
As the sky keeps turning
Sadder shades of blue

The strongest promise, finally breaks
And only leads to bigger aches
Are lessons that I learned
At sorrow's school

I couldn't keep
To chase a future paved with fools
Small county roads don't ever reach

But for every cloudless mile, the sun has shone
There's been a hundred nights alone, at least
The shame is how it took so long
To figure out, fare to Midland don't come cheap

My eyes keep lonely thoughts, reminding me
With every dusty truck that I see
I'm only closer to how far away can be
And all the time that's left is an eternity

Oh, but empty pop bottles is all we would kill.

You shared each breath I drew all night
When I first came here
If my memory serves me right
When I first came here
We shared each breath through every night

Dwight Yoakam,"I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
 
After all this time of being alone
We can love on another
Feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you

Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay

Dwight Yoakam,"Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave

And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home

Dwight Yoakam,"Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the road all losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops of my friend
I'll meet you at the home of the Blues

I walk and I cry as my heartbeat
Keeps in time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of my mine
It's dark here at the home of the Blues

[Chorus]
But this place is filled with sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
That I just want to lay right down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And you ain't got no good way to choose
Come follow me, misery loves company
I'll meet you at the home of the Blues

Dwight Yoakam,"[Chorus]
Well I'm a honky tonk man 
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, 
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up 
And the sun goes down
I can't wait to see the lights of town

[Chorus]

A pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
I can't wait to lay my money down

Dwight Yoakam,"A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
Well a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money, if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you
A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree
And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love

Dwight Yoakam,"They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I have to do is act naturally

[Chorus]
Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I have to do is act naturally

We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely

[Chorus]",Act Naturally,2007
Dwight Yoakam,"She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowed bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there any more
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
But it hurts to see her running with that crowd down
And as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle down",Close Up the Honky Tonks,2007
Dwight Yoakam,"[Chorus]
Oh, it's cryin' time again, your gonna leave me,
I can see that far away look in your eyes,
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling,
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence
Makes the heart grow fonder,
And that tears are only rain to make love grow,
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger,
If I live to be a hundred years old

[Chorus]

Now you say that you've found someone you love better,
That's the way it's happened every time before,
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say

Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry

Guess waiting for what the end may do 
To my heart 
To my heart

We wouldn't wonder, not at all
How much fun each day was gonna be

If I had a mountain top
I know we would never stop
Climbing way high up to look and see

If I had a jellyfish
I betcha we would never miss
A single peanut butter kiss or squeeze

If I had a waterfall
It might not make no sense at all
But that won't matter much to you and me

I guess just to show us, what livin's for

For what we need can be enough

That tried to dance and made us laugh
Every smile and giggle would be free

If I had a big moonlight
We'd turn it back on every night
Just so the dark could try and get some sleep
And if I had a rocket ship
We'd go places really quick
Then have the time to stop and get ice cream
If I had a big giraffe
He'd have to take a real long bath

The moment love first came to life and see
There’s a way lost hope can lead
To help find that memory
Baby if you just believe

A yearning heart can
Teach us how
Regret is hope
We haven’t learned to see
Even in the total dark
I know we can find a spot with dreams

Is letting go of what held us down
And then just to believe

But memories turn black and white, at least mine do…
She said my brother, you know, he used to have this friend…
But this is now and that was then

It’s better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart

I said if you could count up memories but only keep the best
You may not see how good they were without the rest
She said look I tried a lot
But I guess love it don’t like me
Oh and by the way, all those tries?
Sure didn’t come for free

So it’s better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart

Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Are not just for parts

So I’ll take away your sad luck baby
And you’ll change mine

Then pick up all those small hopes back off the ground
’Cause after years of tears it’s hard to say what’s up or down

Cada ves que me pongo a pensar en todo los momentos.
All the good times we had me and you you and I,
Hot summer nights making love in July.
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night.
Una mujer incomparable imma love for life.
Me captivaste with your ways and all the things you do.
My pretty girl, I gotta make it work with you.
Tell the world, tell you girls and your family,
Con este anillo te prometo, your my every thing.
Cause nobody's ever made me feel the way you do.
I jus dropped you off already miss you.
Chica bonita, sonrisa sinsera.
I wanna be with you hasta que me muera.
Lets make a pact and always be together,
With you by my side girl I'm down for whatever.

Something about you baby

Something about you baby

Something about this pretty girl

You stood out from the group from across the room.
I had to keep my attention on you.
Something about that pretty face that pretty smile.
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes.
Yeah this girl she had it all,
The type of woman you take to mother
Saying look what I found, love and companionship.
Someone to talk through these rough times who ain't afraid to handle it.
And understand that my life is different and accepts it.
This isn't what I expected.
Yeah she's beautiful inside and out.
Something hard to find in the world these days.
Even on my worst day,
She's got me happy like a kid waking up on his birthday.
Yeah this love was different it was based on friendship.
I'm letting you know I'm ready to ride out with you.

Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind,
Something about you baby
Drives me crazy

What's up little shortie can we talk for a minute.
I've been having dreams and you been all up in em'.
I know you don't know me I've seen you around.
Your the hottest looking honey that I seen in this town.
Come on lets conversate, take a walk get together.
Just wanna know you a little bit better.
Beauty incomparable eyes drove me crazy.
She that type I wanna have for my lady.
Something about you don't know what it is.
I know we just met but can I give you a kiss.
Grabbed her hand and she hugged me, acting kinda shy.
Dimples on your face got you looking pretty fly.
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you.
Little did I know, you were digging me too.
Now I'm down on my knees got you saying I do.
So I had to write a song dedicated to you.

Un corazón de papel
Pintado de escarlata
Una moneda en el mar
Así fue nuestro amor

Y estoy sufriendo porque
Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame
Esa mujer, esa mujer se fue, esa mujer
Esa mujer que ame, esa mujer

El eco de tu voz y tus palabras
Aun sigue aquí
Las huellas de tu paso por la casa
Las llevo en mí

Y el aire tan sutil de tu perfume
Que vive entre los pliegues de mi cama
Me embriaga amor
Me arrastra amor, me mata

Ah, desde que no estás aquí
Desde el principio del fin
Voy recorriendo las calles rodando
Y rodando buscando tu luz

Desde que no estás aquí
Desde que no se vivir
Parece que el tiempo vuela
Y nada consuela mi llanto por ti

Una mañana sin sol
Un día sin minutos
Una verdad sin razón
Así fue nuestro amor

Y estoy sufriendo porque
Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame, esa mujer
Esa mujer se fue, esa mujer
Esa mujer que ame, esa mujer

La luna no entrara por la ventana
Si tú no estás, seré como una estrella
Que se apaga, sí tu no estas

Ya nunca volaran las golondrinas
Ya nunca sonreirá la madurada
Si tu no estas no hay nada amor, no hay nada
Ah esa mujer se fue, ah
Esa mujer se fue, se fue, se fue, se fue

Que caro cuesta ser feliz sí el precio es el dolor
Saber que te perdí no ha sido lo peor
Pero fue descubrir que como tú no hay dos

Pero es mejor querer y después perder
Que nunca haber querido
Estés donde tú estés, te recordare
Y estarás conmigo

Pero es mejor querer y después perder
Que nunca haber querido
Estés donde tú estés, te recordare
Y estarás conmigo, estarás conmigo

Que voy a hacer sin ti, sí detrás de tu adiós
Se van los sueños que hay en mí y toda mi ilusión
Y si quererte así, fue mi mayor error
Castígame a vivir, pagando con mi amor

Pero es mejor querer y después perder
Que nunca haber querido
Estés donde tú estés, te recordare
Y estarás conmigo

",Querer y Perder,1993
Dyango,"Me gusta, me apetece y me provoca
Todo lo que me hace pensar en ti
Me gusta que me beses en la boca
Y que dejes tu sabor muy dentro de mí

Me gusta acariciarte tus cabellos
Me gusta la dulzura de tu voz
Me gusta adormecerme entre tus senos
Y me gusta descubrir contigo el amor

Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda
Y tus caderas al andar
Y me gusta la infantil locura
Que te envuelve tu vida y tu verdad

Me gusta cuando me seduces
Y como te rindes a mí
Entregándote sin condiciones
Sin pedirme nada para ti

Me gusta que me pierdas el respeto
Y te vuelvas salvaje como yo
Contigo me siento un hombre completo
Y sin ti soy como un barco
A la deriva y sin timón

Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda
Me gusta cuando me seduce
Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda

",Me Gusta,1993
Dyango,"Recordando me puse a soñar
Con lo que hemos vivido
Sin quererlo me puse a llorar
Al saber que te has ido

Es inútil que quieras
Buscar otro amor como el mío
Porque soy y seré sin igual
El que más te ha querido

Es en vano que quiera olvidar
Por más que lo he fingido
Si de nuevo te vengo a implorar
Que regreses conmigo

De rodillas le pido al señor
Que me quite el castigo
Y que te deje saber que yo soy el
Que más te ha querido

Si el destino nos vuelve
A juntar te prometo bien mío
Que mi vida te voy
A entregar como tanto lo ansío

Y te voy a adorar esta vez
Como nunca has sentido
Porque soy y por siempre
Seré el que más te ha querido

De rodillas le pido al señor
Que me quite el castigo
Y que te deje saber que yo soy el
Que más te ha querido

Si el destino nos vuelve
A juntar te prometo bien mío
Que mi vida te voy a entregar
Como tanto lo ansío

De no cansarte de verla
Sin mirar a las demás

Veras amor, sí la vieras con mis ojos
Veras pasión, sí la vieras con mis ojos
La verías de otro modo, con los ojos del amor

Si la vieras con mis ojos como yo
No haría falta darte más explicación
Si la vieras con mis ojos
Tú verías mucho más
De lo que hay a simple vista
Porque ella es especial

Veras amor, sí la vieras con mis ojos
Veras pasión, sí la vieras con mis ojos
La verías de otro modo, con los ojos del amor

La noche está muy fría
Abrígame en tus brazos
Hasta que vuelva el día

Mi almohada está impaciente
De acariciar tu cara
Tal vez te dé un consejo
Tal vez no diga nada

Mañana muy temprano
Platicarás conmigo
Y si estás decidida
A abandonar el nido

Entonces será en vano
Tratar de detenerte
Regálame esta noche
Retrásame la muerte

Dos gardenias para ti
que tendrán todo el calor de un beso
de esos que te di
y que jamas encontraras
en el calor de otro querer

A tu lado vivirán y te hablaran
como cuando estas conmigo
y hasta creerás
que te dirán te quiero.

que más que amor es un sufrir

a borrar antiguos besos

Si su amor fue flor de un día
¿Porqué causa siempre es mía 
esa cruel preocupación? 

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
para olvidar mi obstinación 
y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado

quizá a ti te hiera igual 
algún amor sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche 
sola y triste en esta noche, 
noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo 
aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
para ahogarlo de una vez

Quiero emborrachar al corazón 
para después poder brindar 
por los fracasos del amor

Dyango,"Quiso Dios con su poder
Jugar con fuego y rayos de sol
Y hacer con ellos una mujer

La esculpió de junco y miel
Y de caricias hizo su piel
De isla y volcán su corazón

Cuerpo de dunas cerca del mar
Alma de madre primeriza en placer
La voz de la guitarra
Al cantar suspira sin querer

¡Ay, Señor! ¡Dime quién es!
Mujer que vuelve loco al amor
Mujer de la cabeza a los pies

¡Ay, Señor! ¿Quién serás tú?
Dorada y reina en el interior
¡Roja y olé!, por el norte y el sur

¡Tierra del trigo! ¡Sierra de peñas!
Sueño contigo y aunque no se con
Qué sueñas, sé que quieres navegar

Esa mirada aventurera
Guarda entre lluvias de primavera
Penas de estatua
Que con lágrimas de cera
Aprendió a llorar

Y yo puedo ver en cuanto te miro
Pasar toda tu historia de mujer
Tan solo en un suspiro

¡Ay, Señor! ¡Dime quién es!
Mujer que vuelve loco al amor
Mujer de la cabeza a los pies

¡Ay, Señor! ¿Quién serás tú?
Dorada y reina en el interior
¡Roja y olé!, por el norte y el sur

Dyemond Lewis,"My mind just booked a first class ticket to my destiny by the way
Yeah

Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

So gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen and that's when I drew my first blood
Spit my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circle of friends
All that’s left now is the radiance
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain't scared of no man
I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
With both shoulders that my head is always on
I trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gate
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun, so

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (fly away, fly away)

My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking, they too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
Long as rolling and Whitney's seen different cities, different titties
I bring no money with me, I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

When you were fighting the lie

Actions begged to be killed
A sacrifice chosen
Laughter at the sight of blood
That has spilled
Respond to the inclination within
A desire fulfilled
Pride, for the slaughter is done

While being thrilled
Praise who guards your soul
And for whom you have killed

Fools are the followers of masters they deify
Conversion does not save you from death, die

Twisted truth
Twisted truth

A juvenile mind mislead
In the name of your lord you lived
Serving, your death
A life full of sin, good is evil
Believing the unholy words you read
Commandmends are there to break them
Live by your own rules instead
Proclaim the salvation you met",Twisted Truth,2007
Dying Fetus,"Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead
Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight
Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
Sights of death building my sensations
Ferocious need for decomposing bodies

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control
The child soon will rise, all evil will survive

Birth through death

The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin
I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain

Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging pus
Devour the putrid afterbirth

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch",Born in a Casket,2011

Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby
I came up made a milly, spent it on a Rollie
Stackin' gouda, feta, chedda cheese 'n' ravioli

Or maybe fettuccine, dirty martini
Imma fuck yo bitch, call me Houdini
I'm drivin' Lamborghini, yo ho in a bikini
Eight bottles to the neck, three wishes from a genie

Benjamin ain't dirty, but these Franklins be filthy
Always going to court but I'm never pleadin' guilty
Ballin' so hard I only be slam dunkin’
Beat steady rockin' and the trunk straight thumpin'

I be ridin' foreign pourin' Merlot while I swerve

Like my volume switch don't work
And my cologne is Versace, Medusa got me stoned
I'm always high on something
But I usually like to smoke
We been long time friends, me and Ben Frank
Every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank
Muhfucka you don't know me you ain't in my tax section
My wallet ain't fat it's in the gym straight flexing
I don't call your bitch back and shes checkin' her reception
Bitch with double D's she's all up on my erection
And I'm in the ovaries but I ain't about affection
So easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them
Sometimes this life seems a little stressful
Especially when they tell me that I am something special

And it's all stuck in your head

And there goes the world; she's the only girl
We can't slip away tonight
And while we're all here, going to face our fears tonight
Singing I can't say much more with words like this
Love's just a life we all start with a kiss
Love's just a life we all start with a kiss
Love's just a life we call something like this

I want to give you all the loving that you never had
I try to reach you but I always seem to trip and fall
If I could only be a thousand stories tall

In the silence of tonight
Can't you see my head is spinning
And my heart is on the line

We could use our hands

Been pretending like

I'm caught up looking in your eyes
If you could only see
The way I feel inside

Time to be with you
You were always there but I never cared
Until you went away
Thinking back to then
What I should have done
To show you my love
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

Are you gonna be OK?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be OK?

Fall asleep and I start dreaming

You were always mine then there came a time
You needed to be free
I didn't understand it wasn't in the plans
But I let you be
They say that if they love you and you let them go
They'll fly back one day
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

You always were so carefree in your way
You never let it get to you that way

All my friends think she's too good for me

But when we're home
And we're alone
Oh, you'd never know

It's a freak show
She's a wild one
A whole lot of crazy when the sun goes down
A whole different woman comes out
It's a freak show
Like you wouldn't believe
Even when she hasn't had a thing to drink
It's her style, hide something beneath that smile
Our own little secret, nobody knows
You should see her when the doors close
It's a freak show

She talks politics, art history
How she does it, it's a mystery
Cause when the girl starts talking to me
It's enough to drive a man crazy

She's Jekyll, she's Hyde
She's day, she's night
There's no blurring the lines
She's one or the other
But whenever we're together

It's a freak show

I just wait by the phone
Trying not to call

No lo dudes porque siempre estaré aquí
Y aunque he sido mas que un futuro
Incierto pero es cierto lo que siento
Hasta el viento me habla de ti

Solo piénsalo baby please
Aunque esto ya sea el fin uh
Nadie te va a amar como yo (hoy sin ti me encuentro descontrolado, solo)

Contemplando tu foto con el corazón roto
Loco, loco me estoy volviendo poco a poco
Si tu eres mi medicina mi antídoto fuerte loto
De mi vida ella el piloto y no te tengo y no me enfoco

Es que haces falta tu y tus peleas me hacen falta
Fuiste la mujer el prototipo que mas resaltado
Tu mi brújula, la favorita y única que si me ve se empacha
Demasiado bella e inteligente muy sobresaliente entre toa la gente
Y tu puedes tener miles de pretendientes

Every little piece of me to me it’s frustrating
I don’t need your energy
Your bad vibrations
From now on I know I’m gonna keep on elevating (yeah)
Cause all you do is seem to bring me down
So I don’t need you around

Cause you ain’t worth the trouble no
You ain’t worth the time
I shouldn’t even give you any space inside my mind
If you think that the whole world just revolves around you
I got better better better
I got better things to do
Than wasting my time on you

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And it sounds so fresh it'll make you stand
You hear the highs in your eyes, the bass in your face
This super DJ can rock the place
You hear bass, highs, tremblin' tones
He can even cut the jams without the headphones

You better take my advice
Because it lasts this long
Is rocking the house
One job well done
For any DJ in this world to be someone
To make a fella say ""ho"" the girls get loose
And if the crowd respond to that, the jock got juiced
Enough pull to make some cash
'Cause it's all about duds
And they can jam-pack the place
No matter how much you spend
So if you wanna make some cash or be a DJ
You must rock the house right and know what to play

About to go and damn near went blind 
Young niggaz on the pad throwin' up gang signs 
I went in the house to get the clip 
With my Mac 10 on the side of my hip 
I bailed outside and I pointed my weapon 
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin' 
I jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride 
I got front and back, side to side 
Then I let the Alpine play 
I was pumpin' new shit by NWA 
It was ""Gangster Gangster"" at the top of the list 
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this 

Cruisin' down the street in my 6-fo' 
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoe's 
I went to the park to get the scoop 
Knuckle-heads out there cold shootin' some hoop 
A car pulls up, who can it be? 
The fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G 
He rolls down the window and he starts to say 
It's all about makin' that G.T.A.

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill 
So I go to a place where my homeboyz chill 
The fellas out there tryin' make that dollar 
I pulled up in the 6-fo' Impala
Greeted with a 40 and I start drinkin' 
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin' 
I gotta get my girl to rock that body 
Before I left I hit the Bacardi 
Pulled to the house get her out of the pad 
And the bitch said something to make me mad 
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe 
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave 
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know? 
I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the hoe' 
And her father stood up and he started to shout 
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

Come talkin' that trash and we'll pull your card

Live for the street, ask, you die in the war

Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't taking no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope

Sidewinding niggas tryna infiltrate blindside
A nigga hit you wit the eight, three in the club
Dumbing out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop ones out, five dollars for bitches wit the guns out
Juggle for a couple days close shop thinking,
To you the bubble until the strip is hotter than a microwave

It wasn't so easy, words were hard to find
And the cows in the barn knew it was milking time
Must of been real hard to leave everything behind,
Over there a moonless night shivering a secret fright
It wasn't so easy.
And how many missions more, where to and what for?
Ask the government, tell it to the cows in the barn

Then there was the moon, what did the moon see?
Saw the blade of grass in one boy's eye
And pain that'll make you glad you're dying

Hands that dribbled the basketball
Voice that sang out of tune
Love that ended too soon
A nose that bled for better reasons.

It wasn't so easy, words were hard to find
And the cows in the barn knew it was milking time

So he died there.

And concuss yourself against a wall
And On the day that it comes to be
You have no friends to make you free

Scenes of days weeks and shames they pass
And you know that you're a fucking mess
Forced to replay everything that went on
Alone, in your bed, no comfort from the one

And the empty vessel is placed at the foot
You could fill it with memories puked out
Forced like a young child to labour
Brainwashed into thinking they'd win god's favour

Vomit out memories of pretty blonde girls
Vomit out memories of indulgence in classrooms
Vomit out memories of guilty thoughts unclean
Of those you wished would want to be treated mean
Vomit out memories of non-bloods and guys
Vomit out a one-track pornographer's brain
Vomit out conversations with the only one who listens
And memories of wounds that felt right to glisten

Vomit out the times you pulled at your hair
Vomit out distaste for the ones you claim to love
Finally, vomit your worst self-provoked path to doom
Into an overflowing vessel, now fills the whole room

Vomiting begets more vomiting
Vomiting begets more vomiting
Secrets beget more vomiting
Vomiting begets more secrets",Free [Grey C. Frost Mix],2002

Geah
Hoo-Bang, nigga
Some of that futuristic shit
For that ass
Keepin it thuggish, though
Check it out

[ VERSE 1 ]
The concrete streets bring heat, it's so rough
Niggas test everyday, calling your bluff
Eiht had enough, I'm smoking my fluff
Spitting game, letting you know my turf is tough
My theme is I push music to driveby
I slide through, scoop up four and ride high
Strap under the seat my hood technique
As I destroy your block like _Dante's Peak_
Feel me, partly a killer, clocker for fun
On my turf puttin in work since day one
y'all ain't heard enough about a nigga singin the blues
Niggas bendin in two's while y'all watch the news
John Walsh, wash me up, you're crazy
Havin my face captured 180
Can't go there, ain't havin that, man, fuck
The strap turned me corrupt, so prepare to duck

[ CHORUS ]
Sometimes in the hood it's so rough
That makes niggas from the hood stay tough
Slings packs, pack straps, quarters and halfs
16, double the stash, you do the math		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I guess my mind's on the track, gotta get me a stack
And in fact, homebody, you know what gun I pack
Keeps y'all enemies close that stay cheatin
When they ask make fast and start heatin
Niggas ain't fuckin around - dodge mine
Drop yours, bitch, and lay that ass down
Keep your face to the ground, don't even look
No positive ID and all the money was took
Shook the hell up out the spot and kept away from snitches
Took a trip across town just to floss my riches
Bitches turn into niggas and start yappin
One more hit on your house where y'all nappin
Dumpin one, catch you in the midnight, the late night hour
The hollow point shower
The sweet success thatt you taste has got sour
Straight, Eiht regulate my thug power

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
My niggas disappoint me thinkin y'all can fade it
Still player-hated, wishin y'all made it
Stay down, Hoo-Bangin niggas takin over
G's in lows puttin holes up in a Rover
Told ya, stop tryin to walk in our shoes
Real thugs hail from the west, first rule
In fact, we the first Bloods and Crips
First niggas to drive by sendin tricks on trips
First niggas to hit yo town and set up shop
Bring the prices down low, y'all pick the rest to cop
Copy cats, now y'all dippin lows with heats
Pepetratin Fresh Coast, tryin to roll our streets
Hate your sight, catch you on a red-eye flight
Commence the sweatin the groove just for spite
Lucky though, I give you a pass and let you go
I'ma catch you on the road at another rap show

E,"Hey yo
Lights, camera, tragedy, comedy, romance
You better dance from your fighting stance
Or you'll never have a fighting chance
In the rat race
Where the referee's son started way in advance
But still you living the American Dream
Silk PJ's, sheets and down pillows
Who the fuck would want to wake up?
You got it good like hot sex after the break up
Your four car garage it's just more space to take up
You even bought your mom a new whip scrap the jalopy
Thousand dollar habit, million dollar hobby
You a success story everybody want to copy
But few work for it, most get jerked for it
If you think that you could ignore it, you're ignorant
A fat wallet still never made a man free
They say to eat good, yo, you gotta swallow your pride
But dead that game plan, I'm not satisfied

[Chorus]
The poor get worked, the rich get richer
The world gets worse, do you get the picture?
The poor gets dead, the rich get depressed
The ugly get mad, the pretty get stressed
The ugly get violent, the pretty get gone
The old get stiff, the young get stepped on
Whoever told you that it was all good lied
So throw your fists up if you not satisfied

Are you satisfied?
I'm not satisfied

Hey yo, the air's still stale
The anthrax got my Ole Earth wearing a mask and gloves to get a meal 
I know a older guy that lost twelve close peeps on 9-1-1
While you kicking up punchlines and puns
Man fuck that shit, this is serious biz
By the time Bush is done, you won't know what time it is
If it's war time or jail time, time for promises
And time to figure out where the enemy is
The same devils that you used to love to hate
They got you so gassed and shook now, you scared to debate
The same ones that traded books for guns
Smuggled drugs for funds
And had fun letting off forty-one
But now it's all about NYPD caps 
And Pentagon bumper stickers
But yo, you still a nigga
It ain't right them cops and them firemen died
The shit is real tragic, but it damn sure ain't magic
It won't make the brutality disappear
It won't pull equality from behind your ear
It won't make a difference in a two-party country
If the president cheats, to win another four years
Now don't get me wrong, there's no place I'd rather be
The grass ain't greener on the other genocide
But tell Huey Freeman don't forget to cut the lawn
And uproot the weeds
'cause I'm not satisfied

[Chorus]
All this genocide
Is not justified
Are you satisfied?
I'm not satisfied

Yo, poison pushers making paper off of pipe dreams
They turned hip-hop to a get-rich-quick scheme
The rich minorities control the government
But they would have you believe we on the same team
So where you stand, huh?
What do you stand for?
Sit your ass down if you don't know the answer
Serious as cancer, this jam demands your undivided attention
Even on the dance floor
Grab the bull by the horns, the bucks by the antlers
Get yours, what're you sweating the next man for?
Get down, feel good to this, let it ride
But until we all free, I'll never be satisfied

[Chorus: x 2]

Are you satisfied? 
Whoever told you that it was all good lied
I'm not satisfied 
Throw your fists up if you not satisfied
Are you satisfied?
Whoever told you that it was all good lied

E,"Don't know why
She thinks she loves him
Don't go try
He's just a toy
She calls it only love
Her love it is not pure
[CHORUS]
She loves a puppet
She loves a puppet
And all that I can do is cry
Got no soul
Only a haircut
He's no man
Barely a boy
Why can't she understand
That I am her true love
She loves a puppet
He's made of flesh and blood
His footsteps make a heavy thud
His porch light's on 
But no one's home
I'd love to make her mine
But I have to wonder why
She loves a puppet

E,"You up there,
Don't you think there's something you can do?
Well no one has ever told me it was going to be this way,
Me down here,
Well look at all of the things I try to do,
Every day's another day, but nothing else is new,

Everything I see is broken,
There's no water in the well,
Oh, won't you please send me someone to break the spell,

Well, is it me,
Or is it everyone else who comes around?
They always stay a little while,
But they're gone before too long,
Hey, you up there,
Looking donw upon this sorry scene,
Is is what it's all about,
Or is this some bad dream?

Everything I see is broken,
There's no water in the well,
Oh won't you please send me someone to break the spell?

I've got a million dreams stuck inside my head,
If I could live a few before I'm dead,

Everything I see is broken,
There's no water in the well,
Oh won't you please send me someone to break the spell?

E,"So what are you gonna do about me?
I been hangin' 'round a while
Trading books and knowing glances
I tought I'd stick around but it really ain't my style

So this ain't heaven on earth
Looks like we'll have to wait
But we are standing at the gate

I took a look inside your attic
And secret shelves and hidden rooms
It didn't scare me when I saw it
Your hidden attic is no temple of doom

And this ain't heaven on earth
Looks like we'll have to wait
But we are standing at the gate

So, what are you going to do about me?
Put me on a secret shelf?
I wanna change myself around
You know I would do it if I thought that it would help

So this ain't heaven on earth
Looks like we'll have to wait
But we are standing at the gate

E,"Walkin' along by the LA River,
This river's such a joke and so am I,
I don't know why I should believe her,
I don't care what she says, want to die,

I'd jump right in the drink, but there's no water,
I'd jump right in the and sink away from here,
Poor river, empty river,
I'm feeling just like you,
I'm feeling just like you,

Walkin' by the LA river,
Steping on broken glass, kicking cans,
she's telling me I don't even know her,
I guess there's some things I don't understand,

I'd love to float away like old Tom Sawyer,
I'd love to run away and be Huck Finn,
Poor river, LA river,
I'm feeling just like you,

Walkin' along by the LA River,
Reading graffiti and throwing stones,
She's looking for someone to deliver,
She's doesn't give a damn that I'm alone,

I'd dive right in and drown, but there's no water,
My head may hit the ground, but I'm still here,
Poor river, LA River,
I'm feeling just like you",L.A. River,1993

Said I'm already dead
Crystal ball
Fell down onto my head
Tenderness
If I want it I pay
My true love
Well she threw it away

CHORUS
But I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed

Had some money
And a hole in my pocket
Had a house
But I forgot to lock it
Took a drag
From a smoke that may kill me
What a drag
How the winter wind chills me

CHORUS

I'll shine it on just like MacBeth
In the face of certain death
Of a salesman or a king
And when the palm trees are on fire
I'll take my boat out on the sea

Had a face
But I never could save it
Had a kid
But I never would name it
Have a life
Well, that's what they call it
It's a road
But I guess I could crawl it

I'm always doing something wrong
I'm thinkin' they'd be better off if I was gone

Tomorrow I'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow I'll be nine
It's only gonna be another day

They never tell me what they're thinking
They're always busy being mad
I start to thinkin' could it be 'cause I am bad?

Oh, I'll go where I can't hear them
Oh, I'll go away

There's got to be someone who wants me
There's got to be someone who cares
Don't know where they are but I am going there

I'd tell you to roll something up
Po some'ing up, but I ain't feeling that way
Everytime I turn around, another funeral
Another away man, how much can we take feel this

I'm riding one deep with my gun, naw I ain't having fun
Wondering how to break the news, to my partna lil' son
His daddy probably the saw the angels, death he couldn't stop it
But God, why'd you have to take my dog Todd Prophet
Already lost Mello, now who gon be next
Think I'm feeling safe fake ass rappers, having plex
Who you playing with, don't take your life for granted
So many good people, seem to be the victims on the planet
Can't understand it, now which religion talking noise
Them Catholic priests, be touching on lil' boys
Can't trust your homeboys, you drop em off at home
He call his partna on the phone, they done broke in your home
Now what's wrong, said the Lord people dying too often
With no health or no insurance, can't afford no coffin
So today no flossing, another wake at eight o'clock
Jam Master Jay wasn't a gangsta, but he still got shot what's up

My partna use to be a baller but
(Now he's gone, ah-oh)
And all I can tell his son, is
(Try to hold on, ah-oh)
Yeah she use to be a star, but
(Now she's gone, ah-oooh)
Hey mama, they thought your son wouldn't make it but
(I stayed strong, ah-oooh)

Now lil' Tamika up the street, wanted a baller real bad
Only 16, but already giving up the ass
You got cash you could smash, you don't have to ask
She needed money for clothes, so she stayed skipping class
Catch her flipping in a Jag, or flipping in the Lex
Laughing at the nerdy chicks, who believed in safe sex
She had one baby, had twins then another
Now didn't slow at 18, all living with her mother
Steady bouncing out of town, rent-a-cars with crack
Missing her kids birthday, what kind of mother is that
The ass started getting flat, without using Metabolife
Whole neighborhood wondering, if Tamika on the pipe
Strip clubs late at night, with bags under her eyes
Had the flu for three months, feeling like she bout to die
Boyfriends disappeared, and so did the queen
HIV in her bloodstream, girl died ay 19 damn

Now Lord I know, I'm in the valley of death
And can't no man predict, how many days he got left
Use to run the street, with some devilish ass demons
High on dust not giving a fuck, smoking wet steady scheming
Had to change my ways, and go another route
Now I use the studio, to let my pain out
No more chasing dreams, gotta make it on my own
Can't be waiting on the next man, gotta get my hustle on
Now in case you ain't know this, playboy I'm focused
Only got one chance, no way in hell I can blow this
Turn my last five dollas, into a quarter million
But money can't change, the fucking pain that I'm feeling
From Chris, Paul to Tremain, who else gon go
They even killed Romeo, from the Steve Harvey show
Said I'd be dead in a year, that was two years ago
Thank the Lord I'm still here, hope I live to see mo' let's roll

Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (ma-maa!)

Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)

The cat's out the bag and it's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, let it persevere
I like to see my dick snot disappear
I got inch out the edge, Lawnge Don can't compare
So, ho, come here!
Now some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is live-er
In and out of any situation like MacGuyver
If it's not Boopie's then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to hitting ass I'm a striver
I'll use my dick to fight a war so there won't be no survivor
Call me the Nine Point Fiver!
Cause I'm the sugar dick, the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge
Of the Black Sheep here to point out what's wrong
With emcees like these popping that bullshit, please!?
Hang it up, black
If it's a God-given talent then take that shit back
Analyze the style, go home and re-write
I know you want to be down, I know you want to be like
ME! The Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge
If you think that you can play me, nah, you're dead wrong
Cause I write lines and wreck minds
Being that I'm the DJ I can flip at any time
I'll diss you on the rhyme, diss you on the cut
Have you on the dick so much there's no room for my nuts
Forget rapping, you nerds are herbs
Just get a job and ride my dick to work
Respect the Lawnge one cause fly shit I mail out
Yo, you got the wrong one if you think I'll sell out
Used to have a ho and I'm damn glad we fell out
I would keep on rapping but it's time to break the hell out

Yo bust it, I be a fly nigga as far as niggas go
I be a choice brother but only a brother would know
Chilling Eskimo as the general rule
If you can't say Dres, you can call me cool
Styles unlimited, you can't get with it
But you can get this if you straddled and it fitted
I wondered and I pondered if your family were Roman
Cause you're snuggly and you're cuddly, play me closely like a Trojan
Ah-ah, it busted, aww shit, don't act dumb
You opened your mouth, black, so yo here I come
It's a catastrophic state but let it begin
If my dick's on your minds then my balls are on your chin
Now here it's kind rough, so kids stay on your toes
If my balls or on your chin then pubic hair is up your nose
If pubic hair is up your nose then I suppose
I'm the nigga that gets and you're the nigga that blows
My style is immeasurable so put away your ruler
Think of the coolest kid you know, Dres is cooler
Smoother, slicker, quicker roll-flicker
Honey came bloody so I hit her in the shitter
Went to a first stone caster cum a master blaster
Tell you cause I know, black, get off the slim faster
I know you want to emcee and be down with the rest
But stay on the head now cause that's what you do best
Your duck down sound compound no interest
Get down with the flock, motherfucker, invest
In the rhyming you're designing, I can see your shit climbing
To the bottom from the mid where it hid, bad timing?
What do you want to know, I still gotta go
You're a tic out of tac but I'm busy getting doe
Move over just a bit for the sight taking flight
Still eager as the Beaver and I'm leading with my right
I'll coin one more then step, daggonit
Our dicks are the planet and where are you?",Yes,2003

Under the moon
And thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray
Don't take me soon
Cause I'm here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around

I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more

And our children will play

It's not about
Win or lose
Because we all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving, though the waters stay raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way (no way)

Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (get me down)
So my negativity surrounds (surrounds)
I know some day it'll all turn around

Because
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for

One day
One day
One day
One day
One day
One day

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the fighting
Down with the hate
One day we'll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

One day 
One day
One day

For those who were playing
You don't know what you got till its gone

Well that was my calling
I knew what I was falling into
Something that would be so wrong

But I got hold of myself
And changed for the better
I can't get you out of my mind
Cause something inside
Made me realize you were fine

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry
I can't take all these goodbyes

I know from this feeling
Deep inside there's a healing
I know that I'm in control

Everyday I am yearning
This love I feel burning
Burning right through my soul

So let's make a start
Of something that cannot be broken
The mold its so strong

Treat this love as a child
That grows into something worth while

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry
I can't take all these goodbyes

Deep love's so deep
Deep love's so deep, yea
I can't take all these goodbyes

Faithfully, I will be
You will see, please believe me
I can't take all these goodbyes

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry

If thas your girl dawg oh well! 
(she's going with me)

Enough with the blah blah you know I really
Wanna see your na nas girl get silly
So I told her bend over
I'ma do the facebook and poke ya

[Chorus]

Do you like it in the club'
Honestly I don't like it in the club
But I will not cut 'cause I love that ass
So I'ma stay right here 'til the sun comes up

And I'ma watch you shake it girl
And if you got that cake go on and bake it girl
Shake that kinky bootay

So you wanna go home with me
Okay come home with me
We can get up in the bed for the day
Get it right spend the rest of the night
Up in my sheets and

We can shake it girl
And if you got that cake go on and bake it girl
Shake that kinky bootayy

[Chorus]

And this is how I do it in the club
I need it then I make ya fall in love
I hit it from the front the back
And side to side like that

And side to side like that
I start to sound like that",Club Love [Remix],
E-40,"Tell the cops don't read into it
Them days of slangin' yay been finished, them days have been done ended
So far gone them days that I'm offended
Snitches can't speak my name till they get winded

Can't you tell there's been a switch made?
Now fellas decide that they wanna run and tell like in the fifth grade
But I'm too gone, young'n be clear
Even when you see me, I am not really there

And I ain't play fair wit' my eye on the enemy
Huggin' the block just me and my mini-me
Did it and lived it, grinded here
Cops fillin' wit' my projects find it yeah

Not only was I in the game, I was gifted in it
Served food to the fiends and we called 'em dinners
Put the raw wit' the fake out, mixed it in it
Can't explain the cat's hustle, guess it just was in
It's Malicious

[Chorus: ]
If you got the turf crackin' and ya money's stackin', ya
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Leader of the squad and your the team captain
Quaterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Gotta little change and ya drivin' a range
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
If ya sound system bangs, and ya pushin' them thangs
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'

Might not know what I'm talkin' about
If you ain't never lived it, or seen it, or done it
Seen fiends vomit, green stuff I had to clean it up wit' comet
Mean stuff, so many deaths my streets is haunted

Believe us, you shoulda seen us, like Wile E. Coyote, man super genius
Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone
And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome

It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a Lord Jesus perm
When my name was earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls

[Chorus]

I play the field like Vick 
From endzone to endzone
Serve that ish like snowcones in the hood
Entrenched in the gutter, I was lost in the good
'cause I make the gat stutta like a old G should
Mamas lookin', so much snookin'
Nights in the kitchen thought I'd never finish cookin'
Way before pay for this that I'm mouthin'

19 years young, upward of 80 thousand
Trust me young'n Pusha was never browsin' for nothin' section 8 housin'
I'm stompin' through like King Kong claimin' his home, his jungle
Mumblers beware the hood hates singers
I connect, block the corner like Jenga, fall never, you seen 'em
Posted in the hood leanin' fiends like the Tower of Pisa
Damn he's good

[Chorus: 2X]

Now of course you know I ain't talkin' about sports
I'm talkin' about runnin some shit
I'm talkin' about workestratin' and illustratin'
Glorifyin' ya paper route

Whether it serve it to, uh..
Gettin' out there hustlin', grittin' and grindin'
Doin' ya thug-thizzlemajiggadale
Quarterbackin' man, hustlin' main
Trust that main, yeah, in real life main
Some call it pitchin', some call it grindin'
We call it Quarterbackin'
Yeah, and I ain't talkin' about sports, trust that",Quarterbackin' [*],

They better have a tight grip on they stuff cause I'm bout to snatch 
Your batch if she wants it she'll be mine in the Cutlass 
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' straight laced 
Heard about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason 
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin' 

Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie 
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies 
Bitches always splittin' stick the wood but sometimes wouldn't 
Suckin' and grabbin' my little pecker 
Talkin' about sick on my gold better 

I remember when carts was Barbie cut before I was in junior high 
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina 
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, also down with pluck 
Th finest watch on the playground, the one with the big ass butt 
40 I love you, I miss you, I need you 
And retrospect to who 
Bitch come anew, bitch come anew 

[Hook x2] 

[Verse 3] 
Cause we made like thugs 
Get juiced in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs 
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves 
Hugs and kisses, E-40 can't be on any more 
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste 
Kickin' em' back while they take the place 
Order me a shot of that liquor to taste 
Thinkin' they about to beat my face 
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional 
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals 

Hoochies all in my face with some of that dope water 
Brothers already purple off some of that soap water 
So I'ma make a toast to the most 
Mobbish lookin' brothers in this by midnight 
Cause brothers gotta get the shit that's really in man 
Batches on our jock, batches on our jock 
Mind teachin' things to these brothers 
Cause that's us, Captain Save a botch 
They wanna be like big boys and sport big loot 
They wanna be like big boys and sport fresh suits 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me

We in this baby boy swervin' 
E-40 in the mob scene 
And I'm still down with The C-L-I-C-K 
Comin' yo way in the 94 
Then 95, it don't stop boy ain't no jive 
Sell the rest of them tapes boy 
Where the deposit at, where mine at 
Oh for real, I'm out

E-40,"[Verse 1] 
Bloody murder, crime, drugs, folks smokin' 
Man I remember when it used to be cool to leave ya screen door open 
And let the mosquitos and the flies sneak in 
Look mama and them play whistle 
So I'ma play tackle football with my friends 
I guess them times is gone cause like a wishbone 
I wish I had em' back instead of watchin' brothers fiz-all 
Catch em' out on every track, bar, street, boulevards 
Sweet avenues with dead ends, neighborhoods with antens 
Whatever happened to the days of Little League 
Pop Warner and Boy Scouts, the Old Singing Boys Club 
Voodoo to go to school not thinkin' 
Too busy smokin' weed, sellin' dope and drinkin' 
I guess we're livin' in the last days 
Cause in the last days the Bible speaksof AIDS 
Plagues, brothers killin' brothers, earthquakes 
Youngsters tryin' to earn stripes as a work face 
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card 
I used to be soft but now I'm hard 
Fuckin' nigga, I practice lookin' hard 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Mirror, mirror make the call 
Who's the hardest of them all 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 

[Verse 2] 
Take yo mean face off partner why ya muggin' me 
Fools say shit, I can't help that shit's in me 
It's automatic cause what's mine ain't even took 
It's my mad at the world look 
I said I feel ya man, sometimes I catch myself too 
Mean muggin' folks that did no harm to me or my crew 
But now it shouldn't have to be this way 
Fools say, I don't care what nobody say 
The other man got me this way 
I'm fresh out the pen and out the system for years 
Been fillin' out all kinds of applications to make a grip 
But I don't know nothin' about no computer chip 
It takes that to make a J-O-B in the 93 
But a J-O-B in 93 consists of paper rarely 
Jobs like the oil refinery 
I'd rather work in Napa at the winery 
And then ya wonder why I'm stubborn 
Forever lookin' hard, I been scarred 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard

[Verse 3] 
Can't tell me shit, I come from a broken up home 
Every since I was a youth I thought that I was grown 
Meet me after school nigga and we can get it on 
Ya talked about my mammy now I'm goin' upside ya dome 
I got a complex problem, my guard stay up 
I'm always on the offense side, don't test my nuts 
I'm not a Charles nor a Larry but I'm scary 
Scared that I might lose it and chop you with my piece berry 
I deep into my shit and it's straight like that 
I be quick to clobber a motherfucker with my Flintstone bat 
Nobody likes me on my father's side of the family 
They can't stand me cause they think that I'm sellin' that candy 
I kid you not, all bullshit to the side 
I got 20,000 niggas in my organization 
Now which one of y'all niggas down to ride 
I gets juiced off the underground doja 
You know that Click shit, that independent shit 
It makes me feel like I want to 
Got me a baggy full of broccoli and a crooked eye 22 
I feel crafty, I mean that but I feel great

I got my cousin Kaveo on the mothafuckin' side of me
We fin to spit some of this old flamboyant shit, check game

It's another one of them droughts, my sohob, and this shit costs us like fuck
Niggas takin' losses that they can't make up
Gettin' gaffled for some of that shit call caika
Stretchin' the crack, makin' a bad batch
The screen from a tweaker's pipe turns black
So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin' a fool yellin'
But you all know it ain't no refunds in this shit that I'm sellin'
Cause during the drought season, niggas be lookin' for a reason to rush ya
So I suggest you put up your bootsies, man, and pull out your buckets

Here's another part of this shit that a nigga needs uplift about the game
The drought season mayne, 'cause this shit here never remains the same
And a brother ain't about to let his mothafuckin' capital go, mayne
So instead hes gots to get scandalous
'Cause he can't keep up and handle to his business
Like he used to and he ain't rich when he being through
Gets outta school and a kid gotta make a smooth, come-up lick
Catchin' muthafuckas outta bounds, swerve
Breakin' they punk ass, leave 'em scared
This is the type of shit that occur
So don't get caught loose on turf

I gots meals, wheels, and about 5 thousand dollars worth of bills
Bank account way on the red, fuckin' with the highest overhead
Jackin' off my money yo' ass is out boy and I promise you that
I'm a money hungry mothafucka and I'm so serious about my scratch
So you're best bet is to check yourself before you wreck yourself punk bootch
I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth, and I put that on the Gooch
Droppin' mothafuckas just like a bad habit, dag-nab-it
Tricks wanna get outta line I let 'em have it, now bag it
I got ice cream, candy and all kinds of things of that flavor
And maybe later I might be willin' to go low as long as you a buyer before
'Cause I'm the only mothafucka' with A-1 yola
None of that ol' cakin' with bakin' soda
It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast
Those who got leftovers will become obese
Triplin' my mail off the triple beam scale
I even got enemies, with envy askin' me for yayo

A niggas tryin' to work hard on a meal ticket so I can't stand to be dry
'Cause I have a strong demand and supply
But in the drought season it's too hard to get by
Niggas be runnin' off with D gafflin' muthafuckas, startin' at chances
'Cause a nigga's mail ain't to muthafuckin' fancy
Rollin' around with a deuce and a quarter
Can't get caught loose on the border
Sittin' on them thangs like 40 would say
Stay fuckin' with a bitch's brain

Can't be affected by the great depression
This country is in a recession, I reckon
So let me give yo ass a funky lesson
Never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin'
It's them bootsie muthafuckas in your town that's always dyin'
Stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush mate
Hit it hard one time and then hibernate

Now check game I'm tryin' to do my own muthafuckin' thang
But shit just ain't right
For heaters that got rolled too tight
Jackin' muthafucka's on sight
But I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck
When I'm tryin to get my cash flow up
And render them seasons what ever the reason may be
Niggas comin' up short tied, gagged, watch 'em short out from sea
For sale signs on a nigga's shit
'Cause he ain't got no muthafuckin' P

So let me find me a nigga with a grip and hit his ass quick with a lick
What's a definition of a lick?

I put that on the click
If you consider yourself a hustla can't be no busta brown
Stackin' mail, straight come upin', when funk come around be down

A nigga's gotta have some type of hustle
Whether it be sellin' dank or robbin' banks
Snitches can't go to the pen 'cause they fuck around and wind up shanked

Started off selling marijuana but now I'm selling yola

They clocked me like a circus
I was the little mannish motherfucker showing off in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me with a switch and I say ""that hurts""
Get to the house, go to my room and talk some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
Cause I be moving fast and I'd be tryin' to stash
Beat up the pizza man and then I straight dashed
Disobedient sport cut my days short
My momma got tired of takin' my ass back and forth ta court
I said ""momma I'ma straighten up for you and I promise I won't warrant""
Got me a job as a paper boy 
Twenty one dollars a month
Five o'clock in the morning 
Damn I'm slavin' for the fucking white man
Twenty one dollars might buy me some ??(poor carpet chicken george)
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me 
I was tired of being broke lookin' coked down
Came up off a twenty dollar put me down
Next thing you know I was up to about a quarter of a ki' rollin'

Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'm a failure, I gots no future in my front

Don't ask me why Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Repute the devil
I got to get out of the ghetto freak
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy really payin' me
Who would ever thought that a nigga like me 
Would become such a bad ass youngster
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why couldn't I wait till I was bigger 
Before I started drinking malt liquor 
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn little mannish ass nigga

Guess who comes through, comes through

I'm not a G, a killer, or a rapist
I'm just a ordinary black man trying to make this
Busting my bubble, the couple didn't even freak
They said relax, I'll make some coffee, have a seat
The man said, what's your name bro
Shit I don't know, you might decide to call the po-po
He said that ain't my thang, I used to be a leader of a gang
Shot twice in my chest
I got wounds, where I've been stabbed
He took off his shirt and showed my his scab
I said damn partner, how the fuck you survive some shit like that
Like that there without going into a coma
He said the Lord spared my life
So I could talk to people like you and teach them right
I was a dope pusher, big time drug abuser
Alcoholic, dog blumer, but a shooter
All together working from the floor
I said I better twist so I can call her
Now I'm reached from coast to coast

In the traffic I was gone you see my head was made of stone
Got a problem with me?
Then feel free motherfucker 
Don't be talkin' under yo breath
'cause that might be the cause of your death
'cause I'm a quick to stop a nigga in his tracks main
So lets get this shit out in the open
I used to like to go from the shoulders get em up, one on ones
Now it's a whole different ball game niggas that carry guns
A sucka will kill you first, and you will be layin' in the hurst
Takin' a deep ass sleep knowin' it wasn't worth
Provin' you wasn't a punk
Niggas don't want to thump
Niggas just want to funk and shot up a niggas trunk
I met a bitch last week at the Orgen Room
Bought her a drink and said ""what's up on the telly room?""
Just then I felt some trouble kickin' in
Spotted her X-boyfriend who had just got out the pen
Motherfuckers get to baulkin' when the liquors talkin'
Drunk motherfucka' step on my toe and kept on walkin'
I said ""what's up with ya potna, say excuse me or somethin'""
He turned around looked at me and started mean muggin'
I guess he thought he pumped fear until I said 
""Nigga don't you know I'll have you touchin' everything in here""
He went for his pistol and didn't know I was strapin'
Dag nab it, I had to let him have it

What type of nigga did he think you was E? 
I know he didn't think that you were some kind of peanut or somethin'. 
He must of been retarded to the fact that you get a thrill out of killin'
Now tell me somethin' why do motherfuckers wait till that nigga commits
Himself to realize that a hillside hillbilly is the wrong type of
Nigga to Fuck with? E do you feel me?
Yeah I feel ya sahob
Well lets take it to the next page then
Oh you mean that part about the dungeon?
You know!

The next morning, I'm sittin' in the dungeon-wonderin'
Should I be dissed nope I did it in self defense
I wasn't twisted, I hadn't even started yet
It happened to fast before someone could stop me
I wish I had some dank weed
While I wait out these 24 more hours before I plead
Freedom I'm gonna miss ya (I wish I had some dice)
Made me some dice out of some water and toilet tissue
Now this the part that's fucked up
I walks into the day room manner room what the fuck
I never thought that I would straight make ah
The front page of the newspaper
Shut up a do wop, shut up a do wop
Man they bout to send me up state ah
Talking that shit about makin' me a motheruckin' faggot 
I make a shank outta plastic and let a nigga have it

That's what's really goin' down
'cause when a motherfuckers down for the count
You gotta be about it or be without it
'cause what a motherfucker once told me see a mark sleep
Leave him sleep in the middle of the street
If you can't stand the heat stay up out the kitchen

Now I'm still in the county's face
Fighting this funky ass 187 case
Shoot me a kite that's a good way to mingle
I'll be in this bitch eatin' shit on the fuckin' shingle 
Gettin' big as a house, bulkin' up
400 club waiting for the Mercedes deep roll it up
My dream came true after almost 2 years of incarceration 
Now I'm out drinkin' brew havin' fun with my folks
Lovin' everybody gettin' twisted and crackin jokes
Huggin' anybody cryin' 
I missed every nigga in my click and I ain't lyin'
We bones out to a party 
I'm on P-role but what can I say
I can't let em know I'm stuck
I roast bitches but I'm not a damn peanut
Now I'm at the party thought I wasn't
Dancin' with the dead niggas fine ass cousin
I wonder if she thinkin' my my my
The bitch been lovin' me ever since Hogan High

Penitentiary chances, nina ruff fluffin tap dancers
on your hood for breedin snitch bitch-made niggaz

I fuck with wig-splitters, Colombian neck-tie throat slitters

to get rid of you cheater
Chatter police-ass niggaz takin chances (takin chances)
Man you can't fuck with these circumstances

And all you O.G. motherfuckers better stop tryin to mark them yungsta
cause sooner or later, they gon' dump, like some garbage dusters
Tryin to throw yo' weight around,

I remember when the world went crazy
Til I copped a sack, and put it down like that
and rolled out like it didn't even fade me

Here take a swig of this bourbon
Hit that, hit that baby
Aight dude, ay who who's foolin' right there? (who dat?)
Aight nigga ay get down nigga
Ay nigga get down nigga! ay nigga get down nigga (shit!)

Wha', we about
Seventy-five extra mail mannish hard-headed hoodlum-ass niggas
On the dope track workin' overtime full of fuckin 'd' (d!)
Runnin' through somewhere in the neighborhood
Of about seven-hundred thousand in illegal narcotics
Generatin' through mah street, a week
Why motherfuckers gotta ask me how I'm doin' if I'm alright?
When a motherfucker's starvin' and strugglin'
Even on my hip pretty much needlin' and jugglin'
There still ain't gonna never be enough lovin!
I'm tired of rippin' and runnin', dodgin' and duckin' bullets
I know my time is comin', death is on me bad
The walls is closin' in, I wish I had a dad
But left when I was ten, so moms is all I had
And she was there for me until I ran away from the pad
And now she disowned me and she don't claim me
Reverend wouldja put some blessin' oil on my head
Before I end up dead, gall bladder full of lead - scared
I guess a hard-head make a soft-ass ?
I ain't gon' last if I keep fuckin' with this fast life

He would grow up to be nothin' but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him, uh
(he would grow up to be nothin' but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him)

Ah, I page my ties even though the money's filthy
Don't wanna go to church, because I feel guilty
Nope - I don't wanna die, cause when the preacher preach the gospel
I be ready to cry, up in the church of pentecostal
I don't think I'm a make it to see twenty-five 
Til I wash my hands and come clean
Shit I'll be hella happy if I can just live to see sixteen
No life to give for that nastiness
As a rebellious disobedient-ass problem child
He's easily influenced, hangin' around the wrong crowd
I'm willin' to do almost anything, 
Whatever it takes to make my allowance
I'm on prescription medication, chemically off-balance
Got me snatchin' up ? pickin' up hits
Pick-pickin' indo's (do's), and pullin' licks

[Chorus]

But daddy? (yes son) tie my shoes (okay) lace me up (uh)
Hook me up, like a tow-track man (aight)
Ear-hustlin', make like a pampered suck-up game-a-saur (what?)
When it comes to this thang man I'm connoisseur (connoisseur)
I read through the punk registry in the robb report (what?)
I come off like dat
Grew up around slick talkers (ah)
A pa-a poppin' con artists (what?)
Go straight to the ? and get a bad leather jacket
? bankrupt!

Boy you,
Like you when I was younger
But I got my life together 
And I bettered myself as I got older
Na-uh now I entertain (entertain) 
A sss-uh, a-smeb rover (a smeb rover)
Street smarts with a degree and a diploma

E-40,"Good things come to those
Who stays on they toes
Don't you ever stop
Always keep it hot

Potnah this bubonic cuts, that other shit is high
Fuck what you talkin' about, throw me that childproof lighter
Oh youse a smoker huh? Then go on and flame
I heard you got some shit and heard it come from Spain

Naw, Amsterdam, I got it from the hemp man
Bought the weed 'cause I love what it do to me
Five o'clock in the traffic and I be fiendin'
Without the bomb nigga life has no meanin'

Okay, see I be krunkin' to profession in American-oh
Cristal Brothers Brandy all down the throat
Steady dippin' call me Funk Master Flex
Ass since mom and daddy had sex

Got yo' nigga daydreamin', smebbin' in a check-you
Floatin' in a cloud, music up hella loud
Proud to be in the land of the lights and the beer
Got me where I ain't carin'

Because I like what you doin' to me
Because I like what you doin' to me

It's like this and that to fuckin' with your dick on hard
And nigga ain't no Pebble Beach in my backyard
Rackateerin', smearin', no foreseein'
Shit folks ain't even used to hearin'

We break bread with the [Incomprehensible], thick ass bitch with the tits
And the anus, off the English, how her body speak her own language
And it's cool when she speakin' to me
I let the hoochie run through me

I seen him walkin' in the rain
I guess the nigga owe too much to the game
They say the nigga used to drive a Mustang
I'm thinkin' potnah musta went against the grain like a lane

I cross artists? No not be-Legit
Catch nine of the last ten in my clip
Don't trip, a bitch can't do in me
But I be likin' what she doin' to me

Because I like what you doin' to me
Because I like what you doin' to me

Just think, I used to have to flip cabbage
And now I ride in a nine-seven whip Caddy
Meal game, they call me by my stage name
Hella G's when I spit this game

But just think, I used to sell them weights
But now I'm all off into real estates, huh
We put our city on the map, raise clientele
Made it so niggaz can be proud to say they from Vallel'

[Incomprehensible] side, man I went to school with them
Had him in my class, never thought the fool'd pass
But now I took advantage of the opportunity
And I love what it do to me

They say that I got cousins, I ain't never met
Think I'm big-headed, think I'm all that
They say that I don't give to my community
But I be likin' what they doin' to me

Because I like what you doin' to me
Because I like what you doin' to me

Good things come to those

For sharing your game with me
I wanna thank all, of the hustlers
For showing me your life, on the street

Uh, marinatin' on the corner with a chip in his phone
You can tell that the Hillside was his home
Mo' scrill than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chop suey in the bushes
Dice game, craps, puffin on Taylors drinkin' Boilermakers
M.D. 20/20 mixed with Boone's, Farm's, and Olde English
Around the clock, deuce-four-seven, three-sixty-fifth
Cause your bass rock butter, that's right twerkin' over shifts
Business boomin off the buzzer, and I'm a happy camper 
Til the homey beat his bootch down for no reason with the Zenith hammer
Thangs started gettin' sloppy, dude started rollin' over
Niggas started steppin on dope and stretchin the crack synthetic yola
Turf got hot hella heads got shot on dead body soil
Po'-po's on that ass like hot baby oil
Play your cards right son everybody can have cash

I was sprinkled at a young age
Laced down with Trump tight, taught by the best
Some of them still livin', some of them done been put to rest
But I was blessed, and luckily I made it out
But I must confess, I wouldn'ta made it without
The big timers, the top-hats, the tycoons
The street hustlers, the pistol packin' Daniel Boone's
That put it down and paved the way, for me to say
The things I say, and I'm proud to be straight from the Yay
To U.K. I spits this big time talkin' shit all day
Nationwide, from where I stay to where you stay
B like the Savage beast, keep yo' game creased
Stick to the rules and don't be sellin' out to no police
I always paid attention when the game was preached
Had all the street slang and the latest speech
And now I'm makin' more mail than a oil well
Up all night tryin' to get my money orders right

Uh, uh.. pimps and players (pimps and players)

Without a pot to piss in
Used to drive through the turf in them candy paint Benz's
