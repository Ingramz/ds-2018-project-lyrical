Yoko Noge,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,2002

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

There may be no clouds to ride.
But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us,

Daddy's like a guy who lost his stomach in the war

I went to a rock show to see Mick Jagger
And you'd never believe it, surprise to my life

Am I going nuts or is it just you Mommy?

I listen to the soundless phone.

My thighs are sweaty, freezing inside,
Our bed's empty as ever.

What a bastard you are,
Leaving me all night missing you.

Slowly the door opens, you stand for a while,
See if I'm asleep or just closing my eyes.

I quickly get up and throw my pillows,
Throw an ashtray filled with butts.

Where were you all night if I may ask you so?
Though I don't care at all, I'd just like to know.

Right! you weren't near the phone to call me from,
Or is it you were afraid to wake me up?
I'm sick and tired of listening to the same old crap.

You know half the world is occupied with you pigs,
I can always get another pig like you.
You've heard of female liberation, well, that's for me,
You'll see me walk out one day and then where will you be?

But don't you be too happy,
I ain't walking out yet to give you satisfaction,
I'm first gonna find something other than the walls
To have some human conversation.

Then I'll glow, I'll be happy inside, my limbs will relax.
And I can walk out into the world, singing with my people.

But now I couldn't even move my muscles to go near the door,
I've been sitting here too long and my legs are numb.

Are you listening, you jerk, you pig, you bastard,
You scum of the earth, you good for nothing?

Are you listening?

Oh, don't go, don't go, please, don't go,
I didn't mean it, I'm just in pain.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

The door is closed, she's left alone,
Making herself a breakfast.
Her hands are shaking, her eyes looking out,
Watching the trees grow day by day.

What a bastard the world is,
Taking my man away from me,
Taking the world away from me.

Female lib is nice for joan of arc,
But it's a long, long way for terry and jill.

Most of us were taught not to shout our will,
Few of us are encouraged to get a job for skill.
And all of us live under the mercy of male society,
Thinking that their want is our need.

I've come to realize just how much your presence meant to me
I also realize that now you're finally free

I'll always love you for the special times we shared
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you and you're forever with me

The will of the father had to be fulfilled
I feel your spirit, your voice still gives me chills
The anointing is still touching today
I wrote this with a smile and tears of joy just to say

I'll always love you for the special times we shared
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you, you're forever with me

We used to sing together, cry together and laugh together
You said it didn't matter for God would always take care
You taught me how to give again, when giving seemed to be too hard
The benefits of your love were my reward

And I love you for the special times we shared
All the times you showed me how much you care for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you, you're forever with me

I love you, yeah, you're forever with me

Found out your My Darling Girl
Don't you know you change my world

Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me

Here's my favorite picture
When you were 10 minutes old
And we were right there with ya
To wrap you up and keep you warm
And now that your a little older
I see your personality 
And every time that I hold ya
I'm sure you'll know much more than me

And you were perfect from the first day
They getting tired of hearing me say
I'm not ashamed to stand up and tell 
The world that your my my my baby girl oh

Ladadadadada
Ladada dada dada dada
Hanging tight with your mama
Traveling round the globe

And how he came to save their souls
Obviously what's important(yeah)

Gotta keep teaching you
Gotta be your example 
That shows his life in all I do 

[Chorus]

You are My Darling, Darling Girl

Yolanda Adams,"Choices that we make in life
May take us far
Chances that we take tonight
May lead us into darken places
But at the end of Godly choices
Are higher dreams
But in the game of chance
There's only a guilty wave or stream
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
And it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just
Bow his head
Then I will do it
That's what I will do

I started down the right road
Only to end up wrong
The endless journey carried me so far away
From my home and family
But I'm learning I was never meant to go alone
Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

I'll never go on my own
I'll never go all alone

Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
For it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just answer me
And it's only if God would just hear my plead
And it's only if God would just bow his head

God has moved another mountain out of my way
Led me to green pasture turned my midnight into day 
Placed my feet up on a rock to stay

Since the last time I saw you
God has calmed another raging storm in my life
Led me into safety turned my darkness into light
Now I stand in the power of his might

You would have thought that God already done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary
But he done so much more and more 
Right before my eye's
And I have no other choice 
But to stand and testify, stand and testify 

Since the last time I saw you 
God has worked another wondrous miracle for me 
Led me into triumph 
Now my blinded eyes can see that Christ the lord 
Performs victoriously

You would have thought that he done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary 
But he's done more and more and more every day 
He makes a way and he's made a way

Some unexpected misery enters your life
Then you ask your self how could this be
Wondering why I've been there?

And so is you mind

Your walking down that rocky road

The person that you care about the most just broke your heart
Just to be in the same room with them, you can't stand the thought
I've been there, yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't know if your relationship is worth holding on
How much longer can you take being treated so wrong
You're confused on what to do but no matter what you do
You're gonna make it through, yeah

Can't let it get you down
Not now
Come to far to turn around
Gotta walk with your head up high
Believing you can reach the sky

The size of a mustard seed
You may cry through the night but hold on
'Cause joy comes in the morning, oh yeah

Joy comes in the morning

Just a little faith
And you can make it

Unconditional, unconditional

Who else would let someone nail them to a cross
For the sake of others so they would not be lost
No one, no one will go that far for us

Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong
But still extend them grace
No one, no one have so much love for us

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

Who else but Him, He's a constant friend
Even when others turn their backs against
No one, oh no one is always there for us
So what kind of love

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

So even when your closest friends and family give up on you
There's not a day when you can't depend on Him

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

And all you got to do is Just bow your head down 
Just bow and pray And then give it all up 
And know everything's gonna be okay

Just lift your voice in praise

If we could remember
The moment of our birth
We give our voice to songs and whispers
And no what life is worth

In peace there s all the past
And sorrow clings to angry questions
The days of dust at last

And morning holds us
When worlds come down and down
A dance of ghosts and ragged dreams
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round

He knows when you're a wake

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes the silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me

Yolanda Adams,"There is a place in me
That no one but You can see
And in that place I'm really insecure
I've been hurt before by that 
But I'm really sure You understand
Every tear I've cried
I bet You've cried a million more
How can I get back to where my smile I had was real
I'm desperate for Your touch
And I miss Your voice so much
Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place
I give You all the pieces 
'Cause you made a promise 
You put me back together
Better than I was before
In the coldness of the night
I'm surrounded by Your light
Even in the darkness 
You tell me don't be afraid
I am not afraid
After all that I've been through
I'm still valuable to you
So I run to Your arms
Where I'm safe within Your praise
And just in case I forgot to tell You
Don't ever let me go
I'm desperate for Your touch
And I miss Your voice so much
Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place
I give You all the pieces 
'Cause you made a promise 
You put me back together
Better than I was before
Lord, show me your will
Until you do I promise that I'll be still
So, come and take these pieces and 
You made me a promise
You put me back together
Better than I was before
Before I met You
Before I knew You
My heart ached for something that I could not explain
And then, when I saw You
I finally knew what I thought love was before had changed
Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place

Yolanda Adams,"Someone Watching Over You Lyrics
Say that your not afraid
Your just fine
Got it all figured out this time
All of the plans you made
Will work out
Deep inside you have your doubts
But your clinging to your pride
And you just don't know
Your free to let it go
Cause even when it rains outside
There is light
Even when you cry all night
Your alright
Even when you loose your way
You'll get through
Cause there is someone watching over you
Say you've been hurt before your afraid
That you'll never love again
And why should you take a chance just to fall
But you'd rather build a wall
Than believe that you are loved
Open up your heart
Someone needs you as your are
I've been there
At times I get scared
Its true
But I hold on to that
I can't see
Something inside of me
And that's what give me strength to believe
",Someone Watching Over You,2005
Yolanda Adams,"In the middle of the turbulence surrounding you
These trying times that are so hard to endure
In the middle of what seems to be your darkest hour
Hold fast your heart and be assured

[Chorus:]
This too shall pass
Like every night that's come before it
He'll never give you more than you can bear
This too shall pass
So in this thought be comforted
It's in His Hands
This too shall pass

The Father knows the tears you cry before they fall
He feels your pain, His heart and yours are one
The Father knows that sorrow's heavy chains are strong
But with His strength, you'll overcome

[Chorus:]

So set your eyes upon the mountain
And lift your hands up to the sky
And let His arms of love surround you
And take you to the other side

You want me to trust You, working it out for me

So, tonight when you get home
You oughta unplug the phone
And get alone
Tell your Father how you truly feel
Even if your words don't come out right
For no matter how far you've gone
God's love can find you, and bring you back home

I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
Yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles he'll fight
I've got, got the victory
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me he died but he rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory every day

Truly I've been through the storm and rain
I know everything about heartache and pain
But God carried me through it all
Without his protection I would surely fall
I've been broke, without a dime to my name
But all my bills got paid
Because I called on Jesus' name
You can't tell me that God isn't real
'Cause I've got the victory
And that's why I'm still here

I've got, got the victory
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus

In him I will trust all my battles he'll fight
I've got, got the victory
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus

That's why I have true victory every day

I'm not worried about material things I don't have
I'm just blessed 'cause I know that my savior's there
Because I know that my blessing is on the way
I can't see it right now but I stand by faith
I've fought many, many battles in his name
I've held up the blood-stained banner
And proclaimed that Jesus is the truth and the light
Believe me when I say he will make it right

I've got, got the victory
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus

In him I will trust all my battles he'll fight

I got the victory, yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you got the victory, sing along with me
Yeah, I've got the victory, yeah
I got the victory, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it with me, I've got the victory

Believed in me through thick and thin

You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

But you'll get through it
Just don't give in cause you can

Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answers there within, oh
I know that life can make you feel
It's much harder than it really is
But we'll get through it, just don't give in

And there is no sorrow
That He can not heal

No matter what it is
That you're going through
Hold your head up, stick your chest out
And remember He's using you
No matter what you're going through
God is only using you

For this battle is not yours alone
This battle is not yours, no
You can not handle it all by yourself
No, no, no, no, no, no
It's not yours
This battle is not yours
It's the Lord's, not yours

This battle is not yours
The Lord is the only one who can fight it
He wants to use you as His vessel

Yolanda Kondonassis,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Cada noche que te ame
Todo lo que te besé
Y no sé cómo borrar

Si pudiera despertar
Con un nuevo corazón
Que por ti no sienta amor
Que no te pueda extrañar

Si tu presencia
Me provocara amnesia

Mi vida no es igual sin ti
Quiero olvidar pero no sé
Como empezar como seguir
Como arrancarte de mi piel

No sé porque te conocí
Porque confié como confié
Porque no vi que iba a sufrir
Si tu presencia me provocara amnesia

Si pudiera despertar
Con un nuevo corazón
Que por ti no sienta amor
Que no te pueda extrañar

Si tu presencia
Me provocara amnesia
Si tu presencia
Me provocara amnesia

Para que encontrara su príncipe azul 
Mientras que yo crecí sin privilegios 
Ella cuando creció, se enamoro de lo malo 

Es sobre la suegra, me tildan de ser la oveja negra 
El urbano, dice que soy malo y te hago daño 
Tu dando todo mi cariño, lo que ellos no saben 
Que estemos planeando tener 3 niños 
Dice que mis actos, son mala influencias 
Dice que soy villano, por la apariencia 
Y la pinta de maluco, que soy un mal educado 
Lo que ellos no saben que contigo me quedo 

Aunque a su mama le de gusto , diga que no le gusto 
Las consecuencias de las apariencias 
Cuando en tu casa a buscarte aparezco 
Dicen que no se merece la ausencia que dejo 
Cuando desaparezco contigo

Ella es delicada, complicada, sofisticada, pero 
El que la pone fuera de control es un rapero 

Siempre que podemos lo hacemos hasta lo extremo 
La quemo, la encadeno y ella no me pone freno 
No tenemos limitaciones cuando nos comemos 
Nos vamos en el viaje cuando prendemos 

Nosotros vivimos, sin preocupaciones 
A mi nena le gustan las intensas emociones 
Que le hago sentir 
Dice que de escogerme a mi, jamás se va arrepentir

Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como jack the ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta

El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío

Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su brutality
Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero

Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como Jack the Ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en BET, TRL por MTV, ¡please!
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday
El pasado, presente y futuro way
Si esto fuera la NBA
Fuera Dr. J, Jordan y Lebron James

Abran pasa al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor moreno controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de Caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""Agua!""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el Cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes OK
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su ""brutality""
Ustedes to's me pagan ""royalties""
Tanto leido no me hablen de ""loyalty""
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi ""versatility""
Y no pueden con mi ""productivity""
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una ""opportunity""
Pues, compárense con mis ""capacity""
Sigan mascando lo que Luny hace, el ""beat""
Y Don te batea un ""hit""

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero
Papi, yo soy el favorito de los pirateros
Yo soy aquel que te mata
Pa' hablar claro, papi
El favorito de tu gatas de los dones dilato en mi
El mas que suena en las ""scooter"" y las motoritas
(¡Arcángel, pa'!)
(¡No te copies, papi!)

Hoy mi peine caracol se va de gira
Hasta que no tumbe un par pa' atrás no vira
Mi pana, coja la orilla, póngase las zapatillas
Porque hoy vas a correr mas de una milla
(¿Quién es?) sube ""A"", gorra ""A""
Cadena crornada con la ""A""
Soy yo, criminal-criminal
Yo no protesto, mucho menos me molesto
Al que me tire le contesto

Aquí estoy yo con un beso 
Quemándome los labios
Es para ti, puede tu vida cambiar

Y ayudarte a pintar mariposas en la oscuridad
Serán de verdad

Quiero ser yo el que despierte en ti

Y te enseñe a creer 
A entregarte otra vez sin medir, los abrazos que des

Le pido a Dios
Un toque de inspiración
Para decir lo que tú esperas oír de mí

Why quizas sentiras remordimiento,
Recordando aquellos momentos,
Te va a pesar, yo lo presiento.

En tus aaÂ±ejos why viejos sueaÂ±os vas a pensar,
Tal vez llorar, un llanto sincero,
Realizando que mi amor fue verdadero,
Sera muy tarde, ya lo veras
Yo te perdono, pase lo que pase,
Tu no sabes lo que haces, yo te perdono.

La culpa es mia, por vivir en un engaaÂ±o, no te culpes del daaÂ±o yo te perdono.
Fuiste la causa mayor, el porque de mis pesares,
Tal vez yo salga mejor, anda a ver camina con uno de mis rivales.
Fijate en mi condicion, why a tu cuenta no lo achaques, me siento mas fuerte que antes, pues ya no Camino con esa preocupacion.

En la escuela del dolor, tu me diste a mi una beca,
Fuiste tan buen profesora, contigo aprendi lo que es el dolor mi linda muaÂ±eca.
Te agradezco las leciones, me han endurecido el alma, hoy vivo con mas calma poque ya no tengo tanta esperanza en cuestion de amores.

Eh mirame a la cara why dime que me quieres que te tiro pa enseguida, mentirosa, bandolera.

Lo pasado paso, why anque sangre la herida, se podra perdonar, pero nunca se olvida.

Yonaka,"Dark rings 'round her eyes where her face hit the floor
Bleak days, long nights, tensing when she hears the door
Ten thousand secrets locked up in her head
She needs to escape or she's gonna wind up dead

Call me a sinner-man, I would feed him cinnamon
No water in his hands, he needs to understand
I can't forgive a man of so many sins
He broke a mother's heart, he bit into her kids

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Access to a rifle, it's time to get up and
Run, run, run

Young love was not only then the penny dropped
Face stern, big man, heavy boots, a heavy hand
Lost in the chaos of a million things
All down to the burden of a plain gold ring

Piece by piece, she puts together what is left
Down on my knees, doused in holy water, undressed
Calling on the gods to come and take him away
Take him away, take, take him away

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Access to a rifle, it's time to get up and
Run, run, run

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping

Yonder Mountain String Band,"High on a hilltop, I search the land below
Looking for that love of mine left 20 long years ago
Her love I took in vain, her love I did not earn
Love is something that you might find, but pain is what you learn
On a hilltop looking for my love below

I blew my whistle loud, I blew my whistle clear,
Picked up a fiddle, sawed off a tune, looking for my dear
I searched this whole world over, through the country and through the town
I'll keep on looking for that little girl 'til I'm in the loansome ground
On a hilltop looking for my love below

For years my heart did ramble, [???] without a home,
Put down my ancient tired eyes, rest upon my bones
But now the girl is gone, wherever she may be
I hope sometime she sees the stars and maybe thinks of me
Sees the stars and maybe thinks of me

Yonder Mountain String Band,"A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat
He took a break from running but he wasn't done yet 
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town 
The town line's far away and
He won't sleep for days
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life

He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasn't thinking clear
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town

The town line's far away and 
He won't sleep for days 
And even if he makes it, there's nothing he can do 
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news 

A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past 
About all the women he had known and living life too fast 
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head 
Should have known the sheriff wouldn't rest till he was dead 

The town line's far away and 
He's six feet in the grave 
He's lying there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife
Till the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives

The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.

They found the corpse in the back of a mercury
They got het labtop picking all the numbers
Trying to reach they never meant to reach
They called a top doc messing with the data
Trying to help but they couldn't eventually

She's a rough cut
She's a tough top stuff

Were you thinking of me?
With a love like that

It was a night, a night just like the others
Picked up the pack that she always gave to me
She wore her lacquer top
Tripping undercover
Got in her car, just to never get back to me 
Sneak in her room, she's missing all her lovers
I really hope I can get away with it

You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

Hice saber de la vida

Parte de la realidad
Y ya que en la soledad

Y a mi madre que sufría
Y en su pierna me senté
Entonces le pregunté
¿Qué le pasa madre mía?

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,

And I'll know her the moment we meet

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

You,"It was some time ago
Since the day that I met you
And if but one thing I know
I could never forget you

It was like the sun had risen
And shown through my soul
All the wrongs and hurts forgiven
Love had taken control

You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you
You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you

When I try to explain
Those feelings about you
They say I'm insane
'Cause I can't do without you

You're the reason why I'm living
And the air that I breathe
You're the melody I'm singing
To my heart you're the key

You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you
You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you

With you I can climb the highest mountain
With you I can cross the deepest ocean
With you there's nothing impossible
There's nothing, no nothing, I can't do

You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you
You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you

The way you care
The words you say
The way you share
I'm here today because of you

The way you touch, the things you give
The way you love, is why I live, why I live
Pick me up when I was down
Now I smile, used to frown

Wrong or right, you just keep on lovin' me
Said you must be, really must, must be
Said you must be from

You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you
You must be from, must be from heaven
'Cause when we're together
Feels like heaven with you

I piss off my friends

When can still look straight at night
When he tucks you in and kisses your belly
And strokes your hair so you just don't cry

Would sure make the stand offs and make more sense
If you could stand toe to toe

So I stare down this empty bottle
There is no message at the bottom so how do I solve it
I’m a hard act to follow
I know we sink so slo-o-ow
The shallow is as shallow does
Keep a track on all those scars

I said you’ve got a chip on your shoulder
Getting worse now you’re older
It didn’t hurt, now your sober
It’s you life and now it’s over

And it’s a fresh start fever

Never turns out as it should

No single moment of truth

Break the chains

No need for greed or hunger

Young Americans,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Young Artists for Haiti,"When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom

Born from a throne
Older than Rome
But violent prone
Poor people zone

But it's my home
All I have known

Where I got grown
But now its gone

Out of the darkness
In came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

Fractured my streets
And broke all my dreams

Now Feels like defeat to wretched retreat

So we strugglin'

Fighting to eat

And we wonderin'

If we'll be free

We cannot wait for some faithful day
It's too far away so right now I'll say

I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom

Of broken down grievers

How come when the media stops covering
And there's a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again nahh
See we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before it's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see the flag rise again

Hooked up wit a dopefiend term I sawed shit into hard powder
I'm on the block slangin amphetamines
I'm thinkin about my ghetto dreams on a triple beam
Ain't no, turnin back I'm way too deep

Is you hurtin from hatin makin me reach for my steel?
Knowin I'm runnin with ballers and steady clickin with killers
Graveyard peelers masterminded drug dealers, and bitches love

Actin a fool the savage style from New Orleans to Baton Rouge

Load my 30, leave the crib and bring that choppa with me
I run them streets and make it home soon as my momma hit me
Put my son to sleep and right back to the drama quickly
Papi said he got them bricks and we gon' take 'em down
I call Omelly bring them shooters, we gon' break it down
He said he coming and he coming in with 80 pound
We finna line a nigga up and we gon' take 'em down
""Hello"" (""Dimelo?"")
""Papi where you at?"" (""Mi camino"")
He said it's in and I'm like Papi bring the set
He brought his shooter, I'mma 'prolly bring the MAC
I spent my money on a lawyer and it's time to get it back
I got niggas in the bushes and they lurking
Young niggas barely legal but they murking
I hit them with the Desert Eagle and it's curtains
I'mma shoot him in his head cause I heard that nigga working

Riding four deep, on my way to Meek
Said he got a lick for us, know this nigga sweet
Said he got 80 johns, who to call but me?
So I called my dogs, cause my dogs gotta eat
Let him off the leash now it's time to feast
Got McDonald's money but I'm tryna eat Philippe's
Tired of all this drought shit, this broke shit ain't me
If this thing go right, it's gon' put me on my feet, where I need to be
I ain't lying Meek, this nigga move, I'm leaving him
I got some loose cannons and they all agreeing with me
Black glove, black hoodies, I brought the team with me
Black strap, MAC-10, brought the machines with me
Now we slidin' down the North, to 23rd and Berks
Cause Papi he got that work
Young hitters they with me, they tryna murk
I just tell them ""chill we gon' take him for what he worth""

Load up the AK and the mothafucka MAC-11
Hundred thangs to a dope boy, fucking blessing
Hit up Boobie told him ""meet me on 183rd""
Funny how 187 get your boy hundred burst
Bang, Dade County niggas ain't a game
We call them sticks missed calls they gon' let 'em ring
SK's I just grabbed last month nigga
My new shooter I ain't prayed in a month nigga
Got the devil in him, all he know is M 1
Told them bring back all the paper in 10 tons
See all the boys selling dope just a day job

So papi how you want it? Body bag, clo' cask', keep it clean, let em live, bring back all the dope and cash

I know how it goes though dog, everybody wanna feel some glory
Muthafuckaz wanna do big thangz, everybody wanna tell their story
But I make it so hard to ignore me, got my name in the streets rotating
I ain’t lost no love for my peeps, they're the reason that I feel like I can’t be faded
Everybody wanna do what I’m doing, so I guess that's why I'm hated
All the real muthafuckaz in the hood got my back and they glad that I finally made it
Life is hard for a thug in the streets though, all I see is greed in our people
Nobody wanna see a nigga come up, niggaz act trife when you're coppin’ C-Notes
Gotta roll with my heat close by, Hating ass niggaz in the streets don't die, they multiply
More and more niggaz wanna see me dead cuz I’m breaking bread
Got money on my head, yeah I’m a target
Bullets on deck with my name written on it
And it's been that way for the longest
I ain’t even trippin’ they can bring it if they want it
I can stand on my own I ain’t scared, we can make it happen anytime, anywhere
I'm prepared for y’all I swear, you can find me middle fingers in the air like

Woke up screaming out Buck The World, selling my dope in front of this store
Look around nigga where can I go? Shit’s been slow. Tell 'em I know
Finger print my whole team wanna know if we're up to our old things
But my click thick like codeine. Do you know what pourin’ up a foe means?
Cook the coke, punch the bricks. No time for the dumb shit
Pimp the bitch, she suckin’ dick? Surprised what just one Hun get
And I got 99 ways to hit these streets and get me paid
I ride one deep and keep AK's, I play my cards. What u talkin’ bout? Spades
We still on that ratchet shit, Heckler and Koch automatic shit
It really don't matter how bad it get, anywhere you go gotta have that shit
So I just stay focused of all Roaches 
Waitin’ on the day they approach us, on the front line with my soldiers
Dead end nigga this game is over, one wrong turn and you're wrapped in plastic

Your fall will be caused by gravity blood gush when they push your chest in
Whatchu know about killaz in your rear view, whatchu know about shots out the clear blue
Whatchu know about being so deep in the beef that it seem like you're own mother fear you
I bust shots they hit the dirt fast, Fuck you the word they heard last
Fucking with me you got a one way ticket to hell and imma make sure you ride first class
You shot first with the Desert eagle try to make it a family affair
Send me to go see my dead people, them rotten bastards try to blast I swear
Yeah I’m coming for you brrrrat be prepared, in broad day light ask me to care
If I get caught for killin’ 'em I’m fillin’ 'em with lead

They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow

I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the corner contrary hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, 'cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the mack in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
'cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stuntin' there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
No, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'll tech you how to stunt

Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold
G-Unit homie, actin' like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know

From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small

Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK

Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks

Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it

Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me
I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast
That's what you get, bitch

Just not a game, man
Don't fuck around and lose your brain

Young Buck,"Yeah, Its 50 cent, Young Buck
G-g-g-g-g-G-UNIT!
We get the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners and win

I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this Gorilla enough
I came to ball wit ya'll, pop the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, n niggaz call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might neva come home again nigga, aight!
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my lifes like
Ridin' in Ca$hville runnin all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin
My momma jus hadda dream of seein me in prison
My daddys a dope fein, n i don't really miss him
ain't seen him in 10 years n a nigga still livin
Tha same ol' 2 step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get em' Buck, you know I'm gunna get em'
Raaaaa!

[Chorus: x2]
I know you gonna let me shine n get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D

I know I'm sinnin but I'm winnin at tha same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin ta take mine
I'm back on tha block, wit a choppa n a tech nine
Niggaz shootin cops n the hood runnin stop signs
G-UNIT, The Game! Bitches doin wat tha thugs do
G's, D's, Vice, Lords, Crips n the Blooz too
Move lemme come through 
 It ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin to some oldies
My goals keep shinin, Them hoes keep cryin
The handle of my 45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Ca$hville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin Yayo watchin Eminem, perform at the Grammys
Niggaz like Eric Benet, prolly can't stand me, 'cause
I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties
Bitch!

Ya'll niggaz in trouble they shoulda neva let me in (in)

[Chorus: x2]

Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach em' how to stunt, teach em' how to count stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at? Buck
If you want to, we 50 deep up in here watchu gonna do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name callin
don't be mad 'cause we is n you ain't ballin'
Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks
Can't spend ya whole life payin on ya car notes
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See ima cold young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets, n my peeps thas behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go n buy them all cars
Young Buck!

[Chorus: x2]

We get the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners and win
Ah!",Let Me In,2004
Young Buck,"You Know, Growin Up In The Hood,
Is Gon' Do All Kinds Of Thangs, Ya Heard?
Some Of Its Good, Some Of Its Bad, 
But The Things You Go Through In Life, Make You Who You Are
Look At Me Now!

From The Day I Was Born, I've Been Hustle'n Strong
Been Strugglin' Since A Child, Now Them Day's Is Gone
And You Say'd I Wouldn't Do It, But I'm Proving You Wrong
N They Got They Hands Out Like I Owe Them So
I Ain't Got Time For The Bickering, And Carrying On
It ain't Too Much Into Who I Don't Know
How Many Times Do I Have To Sit In And Grown
I'm A Young Buck, But Still Enough To Know When You Niggas Is Hoe

I Still Remember Them Nights Under The Street Lights
Fiends Don't Give A Damn, They Want Who Got The Cheap Price
I'm Trying To Get Right, Get It And Go
You See People Is Dyin' Fast, And The Money Is Slow
We Used To Hang In Front Of The Store
Flag Down Cars To Be A Movie Star, Go Get A Glass Jar
Once You Cook It And Cut It Homie, Go Stand Out In Public
See The Work Sell's Itself, If Ya Got Enough Of It
Plenty Thugs Get Shot, But See Its All In The Game
Even I Took A Couple Of 'Em, But Still I Remain
I ain't Dippin From That Same Lead Project Figga
I Done Went With No Lights, And No Water Nigga
And I'm Still Hood, That Mean I Still Cook
Get On The Block And Go Get Mine, Like You Should
How Can I Be Good? When Rappers want to Be Suge
Suroundin' Myself With Family, So I Can Sleep Good

From The Day I Was Born, I've Been Hustle'n Strong
Been Strugglin' Since A Child, Now Them Day's Is Gone
And You Say'd I Wouldn't Do It, But I'm Proving You Wrong
N They Got They Hands Out Like I Owe Them So
I Ain't Got Time For The Bickering, And Carrying On
It ain't Too Much Into Who I Don't Know
How Many Times Do I Have To Sit In And Grown
I'm A Young Buck, But Still Enough To Know When You Niggas Is Hoes

I Would Light Me A Cancer Stick, Thinkin How Can I Get
My Momma Out The Bricks, And My Whole Click Legit
Lil Jimmy In The Fed's, Its Just Me And Some Ted's
We Cuttin Heads Doin Whatever To Buy A Lump Of Bread
The Hot Beat Faces, I Really Loved It
To Blow 50 G's, And Don't Think Nothing Of It
We Show Love, But Won't Get No Loved Show'd Back
Whoa Kimosabi, What Part Of The Game Is That?
This A Fact, And My War Wounds On Me Can Prove It
But Look How You Made Me, Go And Show Ya I Can Do It
I Sollomly Swear To Hold It Down For My Homeboy
Locked Up And Don't Know If They Ev'a Coming Home Boy
Time's Keep Tickin', Another Baby Is Born 
that's Gon' Go Through The Same Stuff I Went Through, And More
You Wonder Why I Hustle, My Life's On The Line
My Baby Gotta Have Milk When She Cryin', Come On Da Now

From The Day I Was Born, I've Been Hustle'n Strong
Been Strugglin' Since A Child, Now Them Day's Is Gone
And You Say'd I Wouldn't Do It, But I'm Proving You Wrong
N They Got They Hands Out Like I Owe Them So
I Ain't Got Time For The Bickering, And Carrying On
It ain't Too Much Into Who I Don't Know
How Many Times Do I Have To Sit In And Grown
I'm A Young Buck, But Still Enough To Know When You Niggas Is Hoes

Now Everybody Got They Hand Out
Crackhead Willin' Spit These Millions Till They Ran'd Out
Shorty Don't want to Holla Now, 'cause Her Man Out
But Just Last Week I Couldnt Get It Out Her Damn Mouth
No Where To Go, Look Like I'm Stuck In These Bricks
Seems Like The Good Die Young, The Bad Get Rich Quick
Enough Of This Lemme Take You To A Whole Nother Level
It's Like Stopin The Police From Rollin' Through The Ghetto
Ain't Nuthing Gettin Better, But The Bills Gotta Get Paid
That Money Come Up Short Then Them Tecks Gotta Get Spray'd
Everybody Gotta Grave, We Just Waitin To Go To It
No Matter What We Do, We Still Gon' Go Through It 
Some Say That I'm Heartless, And Don't Give A Damn
They won't Ever Understand Until They Get A Gram
This Who I Am, Not Who I want to Be
Open Up Your Eyes And See, What These Streets Have Done To Me

From The Day I Was Born, I've Been Hustle'n Strong
Been Strugglin' Since A Child, Now Them Day's Is Gone
And You Say'd I Wouldn't Do It, But I'm Proving You Wrong
N They Got They Hands Out Like I Owe Them So
I Ain't Got Time For The Bickering, And Carrying On
It ain't Too Much Into Who I Don't Know
How Many Times Do I Have To Sit In And Grown

I'm Double Checkin, 'For I Leave Outta My Crib Now
Holdin That 40 On Me, Sunk In The Seat
'cause Niggas Feel Comfortable When They Get In Drunk With The Heat
I'm Ridin' While Ya Dirty, 'cause They Gunnin For My Top
I Ain't Duckin And Dodgin, I'm Only Runnin From The Cops
Spendin Grand By The Grand By Hundred On My Watch
Just Got Another Buddy, And It Holds A 100 Shots
I Never Had A Role Model, 'cause He Was In A Box
So I'm Up In The Club With Eather, A Heater Or A House
Everyday There's Another Nigga Bleedin On The Block
But We Ridin' With Them Burners On, Even When It's Hot

Ride And I Die For Mine, Pop's, And I Hide The Nine
Swerving Over These White Lines, Wonderin From The One Time
Thug And I Know I Am, Bird From A Half A Gram
Broke, So I Sold Dope, And I'd Do It Again
Don't Blame That Nigga For Runnin Up In My House, Fool
Ain't No Food In My Daughter Mouth, I'm Goin Out Too
Just Think About What Your Doin, 'cause Buddy, Bullets Burn
