Carly Rae Jepsen,"I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
Don't ever change (don't ever change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

(In the) backseat
(Your song) so loud
(Drivin') so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices and so I turn it up

(In the) backseat
(Your song) so loud
(Drivin') so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

Carly Simon,"You walked into the party
Like you were walking on a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf, it was apricot
You had one eye on the mirror
And watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain,
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?

Oh, you had me several years ago
When I was still naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, you're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?

Well I hear you went to Saratoga
And your horse, naturally, won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with some underworld spy
Or the wife of a close friend,
Wife of a close friend, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, you're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you?

Carly Simon,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth
Peace on earth

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth
Peace on earth
Peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth
Peace on earth

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth
Peace on earth""",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,1970
Carly Simon,"My love is like a red, red rose
That's newly strung in June
My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune

As far art thou, my bonnie lass
So deep in love am I
And I will love thee still, my dear
Til all the seas gang dry
Til all the seas gang dry

Till all the seas gang dry, my dear
And the rocks melt with the sun
I will love thee still, my dear
While the sands of life shall run

And fare thee well, my only love
And fare thee well a while
And I will come again, my love
Though it were ten thousand miles
Though it were ten thousand miles","A Red, Red Rose",1970
Carly Simon,"Over in Cararne
Many years ago
My mother sang a song to me
In a tone so sweet and low.
Just a simple little ditty
In her good old Irish ways
And I'd give the world
If she could sing that song to me this day

[Chorus]
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
Hush now
Don't you cry
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
That's an Irish Lullaby

Often dreams I've wondered to that cot again
I feel her arms a huggin me
As when she held me then
And I hear her voice a hummin' to me
As in days of yule
When she used to rock me fast asleep
Outside the cabin door

[Chorus]

Don't you cry","Sleep Baby, Sleep",1970
Carly Simon,"Who has seen the wind scalloping the sea
Or gliding like a swallow over villages and trees?
""I have,"" said the willow,
""And I begged him please to stay, but he went away,
He went on his own one day."" And I sing
""One love have I,"" and he sings, ""Now it's goodbye,""
And I sing ""Part of me dies until I see you again.""
Who has seen the sun through a parasol of leaves,
Through scattered ruby cloud fires, through the silver wings of bees?
""I have,"" said the waters, ""and I held his face to mine,
But he left in time, he went in his own good time.""
And I sing ""One love have I,"" and he sings,
""Now it's goodbye,"" and I sing
""Part of me dies until I see you again.""
Who has seen the stranger in a coat of simple brown,
With his face of many faces, with his eyes turned out of town?
I have and I kissed him and I begged him please to stay,
But he went away, with the sun and the wind away.
And I sing ""One love have I,"" and he sings,
""Now it's goodbye,"" and I sing
""Part of me dies until I see you again""",Who Has Seen the Wind?,1970
Carly Simon,"Wynken and Blynken and Nod one night
Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish?
The old moon asked the three
Well, we're going out fishing for herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod","Wynken, Blynken and Nod",1970
Carly Simon,"Come into the garden, It's magical trees
Dapple the sun as they sway with each lazy breeze
They'll set your mind at ease

Pretend you're a child, with nothing to hide
Then we'll join hands and let the universe swing wide
We'll lay our fears aside

Hold me, here we can soon be born again
Trust me, believe we can still be born again
We've been sleeping all our lives
At least we can open our eyes

Our gates are unguarded, I've stolen the key
To where everything holy inside us is free to run free
To smell and taste and touch and see

Hold me, here we can soon be born again
Trust me, believe we can still be born again
We've been sleeping all our lives
At last we can open our eyes",The Garden,1971
Carly Simon,"Tell me who you long for
In your secret dreams
Go on and tell me who you wish I was
Instead of me

I'm not necessarily
The girl you think you see
Whoever you want is exactly who
I'm more than willing to be
I'll be carefree
A Peace Corps trainee
Your Gypsy Rose Lee
To please you

Who cares what I might be for real
Underneath my games
I'll let you chose from a thousand faces
And a thousand names

I'm not necessarily

Carly Simon,"You came smilin' softly, shyly movin'
Easy as a dreamer into my room
And before I realized the danger
I found myself looking into your eyes
Somewhere in their colors I saw promises
Of things I'd never seen before
It's all over
I've got to have you

Holding onto, talking, saying nothing
Knowing in a moment I could lose you
Then without a warning I remembered that
You trembled at the touch of my hand
Knowing when you came to me that no one else
Would ever feel the same in my arms
It's all over 
I've got to have you

Wakin' in the morning to the tenderness
Of holding you asleep in my arms
Dreaming while my hair was blowing
Softer than a whisper on my cheek
I don't know the feeling so I don't know if it's love
But it's enough
It's enough
I can't help it
I've got to have you
It's all over 
I've got to have you",I've Got to Have You,1971

Lookin' up at me
You've just got to be
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.

Julie through the glass
Just born a day ago
And who knows where you've been
And where you're gonna go.

We want you to love the world
To know it well and play a part
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself
'Cause that's where loving really starts.

I'm looking forward to
Doing things with you
For many years to come.",Julie Through the Glass,1971
Carly Simon,"Our first day together
Was after we'd been close in dreams
Was after we'd shared hell and heaven
And all the places in-between
And all the places in-between

After we'd spent nights together
And breathed secrets without words
After we'd made promises
That could but might not have been heard
Might not have been heard

Knowing me the way you do
Then why did you just say
That our first day together
Was today?",Our First Day Together,1971
Carly Simon,"Here come the priests, each one wailing and bemoaning
Lordy, they got their heads bowed down
Here come the madmen, they're too excited for atoning:
""Burn the mosque,"" they're shouting, ""Burn it down!""

Save me a place, surround me with friendly faces
All of us have gathered here to share the end 
To watch the world go up in flames

Please, Lord we're not ready
Give us a day
Give us an hour

Here come the kings, Let's dispense with their apologizing
Just bring on the acrobats and clowns
Here comes the rumble, Hang on for universal dying
Please ignore the baying of the hounds

Save me a place, surround me with deadly faces
All of us have gathered here to share the end -
To watch the world go up in flames

Please, Lord we're not ready
Give us some time to work things out

Carly Simon,"Here now summer's coming around again
Every year it seems to come in this way
Before you know it you've fallen in love
But be sure it's love before you sail away

You see someone wearing a sunny face
You want to know him anyway that you can
Tell him you're just in from Shanghai
And his smile you just can't pass by

Follow him away
Follow him away

Sad to say he hasn't seen you come by this way
His sunny smile just reflects sunny days
Haven't you seen his face before

Every year it seems to come this way",Summer's Coming Around Again,1971
Carly Simon,"If I have known you only three days
Then how will I remember you in ten?
But I could swear I'll love you always
And if the gods will please be kind
Darling, I'll be with you soon, soon again.

And on the road you have some good times
But when the show is over you go home
And it hurts me so to leave you behind,
And lordy I feel lonesome,
Lonesome for the you I might have known.

You'll be in L.A. in the morning
And I'll be in London by sundown
But when I sing, my song is filled with longing
And the memory of your last look
The way you took me by surprise
And the way you turned my head around
And the way you turned my head around.",Three Days,1971
Carly Simon,"The Carter family lived next door for almost 14 years
With Gwen and I inseperatable from rag dolls through brassieres
Then Gwen began to bore me with her giggles and her fears
The day the Carters moved away, I had to fake my tears
I told new friends Gwen Carter had become a silly pest
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed

Grandma used to nag at me to straighten up my spine
To act respectful and read good books
To take care of what was mine
I hated being criticized and asking her permission
So what if her advise was wise, It always hurt to listen
I didn't cry when Granny died, she made me so depressed
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed

You used to make me moan in bed, but that can't be enough
My friends complained your jokes were crude,
Your manners were too rough
Don't know just what I wanted, but I know I wanted more
Someone smooth, presentable, to blend with my decor
And now at night I think of how you grinned when you undressed
And I find I miss you more than I'd ever have guessed.",The Carter Family,1972
Carly Simon,"At night I heard God whisper lullabies
While Daddy next door whistled whisky tunes
And sometimes when I wanted, they would harmonize
There was nothing those two couldn't do

Embrace me you child, you're a child of mine
And I'm leaving everything I am to you
Go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy
And God sang, Pray the devil doesn't get to you

I thought together they must sing the moon away
I thought that they must know each other well
For the magic that they made, when they played
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell

Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven
And God came down to earth and slipped away
I pretended not to notice I'd been abandoned
But no-one sang the night into the day
And later night time songs came back again
But the singers don't compare with those I knew
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went
But there was nothing those two couldn't do","Embrace Me, You Child",1972
Carly Simon,"His friends are more than fond of Robin
He doesn't need to compliment them
And always as he leaves he leaves them

Carly Simon,"I remember a time, rompin' through the woods
Sun against our skin instead of clothes
When we felt hungry we would eat, whn we felt glad we would dance
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze

It was so easy then never takin' any stands
It was so easy then, holdin' hands

I remember a time when our fears could be named
And courage meant not refusing dares
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks,
No only on the squares
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears

It was so easy then never makin' any plans
It was so easy then, holdin' hands
It was so easy then never makin' any plans
It was so easy then, holdin' hands

And now we are grown, with debts and regrets
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams

They tinker with love in their Model T's

And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down

Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower

Carly Simon,"It should have been so soft, this morning as we left
But the valley was infected, by a different kind of beauty
And the Indians they knew, it was a devil's sanctuary.

Out of this unholy dawn, a car came stirring up the sand
And a woman from a passion play
Held up the limousine that brought me
All this way today. And I didn't need to turn around
So strong was the message, and the man who planned her life
Commanded all that followed: Well they bellowed, and they hollered
And they threw each other down, down in this valley
This cruel and lovely valley, Oh it should have been an alley
In some low down part of town

As the lights came up, there was no sun
And brandy splattered all over the ground
As this woman with her head held high
Yelled love and why oh why, you're killing me oh follow me-
As I watched safe and clean, from the frosted windows of that limousine

Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley
Oh it should have been an alley, in some low down part of town

Before he'd been so funny, imagining the best:
That he'd escape recrimination, for abandoning the nest
He'd been joking and stoned, while he was entertaining me
But then turned and was stunned, by her panic and her misery

And I was in the get-away car
Giving him a chance, to get away
Get away, get away

And how the valley smoked, as he crossed Route 25
With his cymbals and his shattered crown, leaving all alone
His eyes fixed on the ground. And he didn't even turn around
So strong was the message, and he fell into the shallow sky
And was swallowed.
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley
Well it should have been an alley, In some low down part of town",Memorial Day,1979

Amazed by all that sand
I as in a sea of white
Swimming through the land
Nobody shocked me
Nobody locked me up
Nobody took my time
Nobody shook me up

The endless sand in the moonlight

I was in the desert
In the opalescent moon
Watching the horizon
And waiting for the moon
Nobody talked to me
Nobody looked me up
Nobody walked up to me
Nobody shook me up
All that happened was the white night
The endless sand in the moonlight

I was in the desert
Free to live or die
Looking in the mirror
And seeing just the sky

Nobody said what to me
Nobody shoved me
Nobody loved me

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1980
Carly Simon,"You imagine when you see her
That she's nothing less that perfect
That she has no aspirations
Beyond driving in her car
The car she looks so good in
Will she ever look that good again
You'll never have to know
Because she's gone

She passes in the left lane
And you're turned on by the chase
Her hair flies in the wind
As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
Drunk and lying with the gutter in her face

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

You think she knows the bible
And can swin the English Channel
Writes novels in her spare time
In a cabin in her woods
You wish I'd gone to college
And you wish I'd let my hair grow
You wish I didn't have so many moods

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am

Once you said you were in love with me
And maybe you still are
But the passion you once showed me
Now is lost among the stars
And you fancy some new fancy girl
Will come and change your life around
But she just turned the corner in her car

While for some other dreamin' driver
I am that romantic stranger
Lookin' better than I am
More mysterious by far
Speeding through his dreams
While I'm drivin' in my car

Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

When they move into your neighbourhood
They take over but good
They want you all body and soul

What do they want
What shall we do about them
What do they want
What shall we do about them
What do they want

One of them asked me to dine
Then he ate me all up
Got full then he blew me up
I got big and round and lovable
He saw I was immovable
He got bored, went to war
I got one baby, he's giving me more
Once I swore I'd never give myself up

[Chorus]

I know that them we are not
I have loved them a lot
And I have loved a lot of them

Enough to know that they are aliens

Say it's O.K., do it their way
I used to say I'd never give myself up

Where do I resist
One has to go
One is just a guest

You'd called to me years ago
I had heard
Your voice before
One is all a fire
One is all a spark
But here I am with the two of you
The three of us in the dark

The eerie sound of one lone fiddle
The wind is finding the tune
And you lying here in the middle
As innocent as the moon
Entangled in embraces that God will never see
Do you know me

Who am I talking about
It all gets so confused
And what would I do
If I had to choose

One is all a spark
And here I am with the two of you

That we both required freedom

I'd nonchalantly greet you,
I'd ask you up for coffee

And leave me dizzy with your laughter -

You and some girl gonna travel around,
You bought a car with foldback seats,

Was ready to be reborn
And you called of the hounds
Of hell with your songs

And they're moving out to Malibu
To play with all his pretty toys
And you feel closed in by the same four walls
The same old conversation
With the same old guy you've know for years
But use your imagination
And you will see....

It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire

Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes

Don't look at yourself in the same old way
Take another picture
Shoot the stars off in your own backyard
Don't look any further

Me and Jenny, twinklin' like crystal and pennies
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Looking for love

""Look Jenny"" I said ""It's Dwight he just came in""
I got excited but Jenny was quick
The kettle was on and it started up steamin'
And I knew from her flirtin' she was up to her tricks
Me and Jenny, twinklin' like crystal and pennies
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Looking for love

A song on the jukebox made me feel lonely
The kettle boiled down and evaporated me
But who was to notice 'cause Jenny was glowin'
And Dwight was all over her like a honey bee

Me and Jenny, twinklin' like crystal and pennies
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Looking for love

Maybe I shouldn't have worn such a long dress
Maybe he thinks I'm too young or too old
If only I hadn't been born with these sad eyes
Perhaps I'm too shy or too bold

Me and Jenny, twinklin' like crystal and pennies
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Looking for love

""Thanks for introducing us""
Said Dwight polite
And I waved goodnight
I wondered why it wasn't me
I guess it's just that the time's not right

Carly Simon,"""I'm in love with him"" she said
With all the innocence of tender years
But somewhere down the road ahead
I could see the same eyes
Filled with bitter tears
I had the inclination
To tell her not to drop her guard
To tell her that life can be hard
But I didn't have the heart

You have to hurt to understand
You have to get by the best you can
Until you hurt, until you cry
You won't know about love
And the reason you're alive
You have to hurt

She said ""I know he'll never leave me
I've never felt it deep inside like this before""

It was good to see her, believe me
But just couldn't stand to hear this anymore
All that expectation
Too naive to really see
Maybe she knew better than me
It was better just to let her be

You have to hurt to understand
You have to get by the best you can
Until you hurt, until you cry
You won't know about love
And the reason you're alive
You have to hurt

Little sister, you're so sweet
Thinking love runs smooth
You don't know the half of it
We laugh until we lose
There's no way round it

You have to hurt to understand
You have to get by the best you can
Until you hurt, until you cry
You won't know about love
And the reason you're alive
You have to hurt

Better not make her jealous of me
Better convince her there was nothing between us
I'm not those initials in your diary
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
The promises after

Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid
Let it all go now, Like smoke from a candle
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper

That I think of you still

Carly Simon,"In a pine forest cooler than the rest of the island
Lives a young fisherman with eyes like the sea
He built his own boat and made his own cabin
but he's broken the hearts of the likes like me

Now you must understand he made me a promise
there were secrets we shared we planted a tree
We lived in a cabin, I fished along side of him
I fell under the spell of his sorcery

When he cast me adrift at the end of the summer
It was not for another but his own privacy
I fell apart like a rose, but the scent of my longing
Remains and it weeps like an old willow tree

At night when it's still, with a yellow moon rising
When his candle is snuffed and he's deep in a dream
I move like a cat, and crawl into his window
And lie down beside him in a golden moonbeam

The smell of his skin is just like the summer
When our love was as fresh as the grass in the fields
And ever so softly I kiss his eyelids
Before slipping away, my secret concealed

Though I'm in it alone, I'm still in it, In love
And love can be lonely like a sweet melody
But just maybe he feels like a whisper inside him
Like an angel beside him, keeping him company",Fisherman's Song,1990
Carly Simon,"It's all of our birthdays this summer
One number older, another year younger
I'll go to your party, you'll come to mine
We've given up cigarettes, we've given up wine
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts
I don't try to seduce you, we don't even flirt
We're too good to be happy, too straight to be sad
So just blow out the candles, Happy Birthday

Stay out of the ocean, stay out of the sun
Stay in perfect shape and be number one
We've got brilliant excuses for having no fun
So blow out the candles, Happy Birthday

Make love in the microwave
Think of all the time you'll save
And don't forget to make it look
As though you're working very very hard

But I'll be your lover if you will be mine
We'll go back to the garden and have a good time
And if I'm offered an apple, I'll politely decline
And just blow out the candles

What was it you saw
Are you gonna catch me
With my hand in the jar, naked singing in the choir?

Are you gonna shame me and take my toys away?

But how do you know when you can't see
Your eyes where midnight catches fire
I can't describe this dizzy desire

Can you be so insecure
That you don't know what this grin is for
Do you think I always act this way
Silly and silent, and eager to stay
When you're holding me tonight
Holding me tonight

You think it's all a mistake
That I'm lost in a dream from which I'll wake up
There you'll be just another guy
You could never be but I dare you to try
When you're holding me
Holding me tonight

I walk into your room
You blush when I see it in a mess
So I undress and close my eyes

Is in the dark with you
But that should come as no surprise

Carly Simon,"I've been doing a lot of thinking
About growing older and moving on
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on
For a long, long stay
But just how long and who knows
And how and where my spirit will go
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone
Or evaporate on a breeze
Won't you tell me please
That life is eternal
And love is immortal
And death is only a horizon
Life is eternal
As we move into the light
And a horizon is nothing
Save the limit of our sight

Here on earth I'm a lost soul
Ever trying to find my way back home
Maybe that's why each new star is born
Expanding heaven's room
Eternity in bloom
And will I see you up in that heaven
In all it's light will I know you're there
Will we say the things that we never dared
If wishing makes it so
Won't you let me know

And love is immortal
And death is only a horizon

Carly Simon,"An occasional joint, a glass or two of beer
Still I would never have guessed that you'd wind up here
In a half-way house, on a dead-end street
In a run-down part of a one-horse town
But just do what they say, don't worry 'bout your girl
'Cause I won't run away, and I won't run around
And I won't let you down, and without a doubt
I'll be waiting, waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out
You set the world on fire, dancing after dark
Now you're playing solitaire in a fenced-in park
I'm not the one to judge you, so baby don't be scared
No one gets a free ride, none of us is spared
I'll be back on the ninth, I've circled the date
Three o'clock sharp, and I won't be late
You've been through hell I know what that's all about
And I'll be waiting, waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out

The doctors have so little faith
They say you were a classic case
They said the chance is eight in ten
They'd see you back in here again

But I'm counting on you to prove the doctors wrong
I'm imagining you, healthy and strong
Your papers all stamped, your eyes so bright and blue
Looking like a baby picture of you
Walking down the path, your suitcase in your hand
The howling at your back, a brand new man
Be a perfect little camper, be a brave little scout
And I'll be waiting waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out...

The hammock swings lower and touches the grass
The apples are ripe and the corn is past
Everyone says some goes by so fast
And we just got here

I can hardly believe it but it's ended
The beach is a haze and old love's a ghost
Hugo is twisting his way up the coast
If you blew out to sea I'd love you most
And we just got here

Nostalgia you fake, you bitter sweet ache
The time that you take could make another heart whole
Could the truth be I won't really see
How much I love you
'Til it's over

Put our faces in place for September's dance

A simpering, whimpering child again

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it although the laughs on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms

Since this half-pint imitation put me on the blink

Called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show, but Miss Kate said ""No,

Knew all the players by their first names
Told the umpire he was wrong all along

And your house is up for sale
We divided your railway watches
Between the four of us
I fought over the pearls
With the other girls
But it was all a metaphor
For what was wrong with us
As the room is emptying out
Your face so young comes into view
And on the back porch is a well-worn step
And a pool of light you can walk into

I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you, forever

Can you clear up the mystery of the Sphinx?
Do you know any more about God?
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin
On the face of the moon?
Have you reconciled with Dad?
Does the rain still make you sad?
Last night I swear I could feel you
Moving through my room
And I thought you touched my feet
I so wanted it to be true

And a footlight you can step into

In the river I know I will find the key
And your voice will rise like the spray
In the moment of knowing
The tide will wash away my doubt
'Cause you're already home
Making it nice for when I come home
Like the way I find my bed turned down
Coming in from a late night out.
Please keep reminding me
Of what in my soul I know is true

Come in my boat, there's a seat beside me
And two or three stars we can gaze into

I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you forever

A star that's always watching
Never turn away

And the secret is crimson
Can you be quiet when my hands are heat

Can you ride the tide in this insanity
And still keep as still as the shadows?

When the cry is so wide on the inside
When the truth jumps quick to the heart
When the wind or the stars are violent
Can you be silent?

All the wisdom you need
And you'll be needing some
Can be heard in the mouth of a seashell""

On the window,
and a silver screen of rain!

in a world of love-struck wonder;

Falling in love, but in flashback.

that gorgeous music;
And I wake up,
Rattling down the railroad track.

He could be sweet,
But I stayed on my guard.
Just how good a liar
can a decent man be?

I always played my hand
Like I didn't have the cards.
Cause he held them all
So I could never see.
Yes, he played me for a fool,
and I agreed.

And the closing credits roll,
And the waves come in like thunder.
Cause the hero's lost control,
And I made a fatal blunder.

Just another sad story;
Two star-crossed kids,
Racing headlong up a cul-de-sac.

And then that music,
That mournful music.
And the train's disappearing
Down that railroad track.

And the long, slow dissolve,
As we fade to black.",Film Noir,1997

To share a kiss the devil has known

You flew away, and time grew cold
Where is that star
That seems so bright
Ages ago, last night

On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung, 
When we were young last night

We built our house on our love
We had a heart on the hill

The tower was crumbling down
Around us on the hill

Oh, we've got to leave this town together
Clean out another house

Amity is not too much to ask

We reach to the sky still
In hopes we'd be able
To see the bigger picture later on

But we tumbled down
Jack 'n' Jill all around
As the valley swallowed up
All the dreams we had made

Oh, see the lighthouse in the distance
On some farther shore

WRITER CARLY SIMON



A hot cloud was hanginÃ‚'around We were a rowdy crowd
DrinkinÃ‚'beer and smokinÃ‚' at the end of the pier Danny was shufflinÃ‚' through a magazine ClippinÃ‚'out pictures of a car To get us out of here Laura was hounding him to get a bike
Warning him the time was now Or heÃ‚'d be out on his ear, sheÃ‚'d disappear If only we could cross the river We couldnÃ‚'t get a jump-start on life The whispers across the Hudson
Grow louder in our ears Louder in our ears every night
We were all somewhat out of school Jersey by birth, relaxing but not on a holiday An appalling amount of time spent at the mall Not a tragedy, but not exactly the Milky Way Looking for a bigger laugh, a better store, A cutter guy, a shorter working day, better pay If only we could cross the river We couldnÃ‚'t get a jump-start on life The whispers across the Hudson Grow louder in our ears Louder in our ears Louder in our ears every night When Laura and Danny broke up She set her sights on Billy Stone Well, I had just split from Jonathan So by chance, I was all alone Danny and I got along as well We spent hours on the phone Just talkinÃ‚'on the phone When I was twenty and crazy as a joke I went to bed with a broker
When I was broke I got used to doormen and limousines
And Christmas cards from friends signed by a machine And woman, they were calling me ""MaÃ‚'am"" As they cleaned up after me If only we could cross the river But something is holding us back A way of life thatÃ‚'s too familiar Like the lines are to the railroad track If only we could cross the river We couldnÃ‚'t get a jump-start on life The whispers across the Hudson Grow louder in our ears Louder in our ears every night Dear Laura, I know itÃ‚'s been years Since I crossed the bridge back to the Palisades How are your kids? Mine are both swell little fellas Here are some clippings of me and Brad
At a charity ball and a White House sup IÃ‚'ve perfected my smile for the camera Chin is up I miss you all so much If only I could cross the river But something me holding us back
A way of life thatÃ‚'s too familiar Like the lines are to the railroad Lines are to the railroad
If only we could cross the river
We couldnÃ‚'t get a jump-start on life
The whispers across the Hudson
Grow louder in our ears
Louder in our ears
If only we could cross the river
But something is holding us back
A way of life thatÃ‚'s too familiar
Like the lines are to the railroad

WRITER CARLY SIMON

All my doctors and friends
Have concocted these theories
Weary of seeing me day after day
On the edge of my bed
Leery of living
My laughter on hold
My sadness on stay

And itÃ‚'s been this way for quite a while
Yes, I forget how to smile
IÃ‚'d like to rely on my old game and yet
Even that I forget
ItÃ‚'s not there, I regret

CouldnÃ‚'t get up today
I pretended a fever
Any excuse but the truth will do
I donÃ‚'t lie very well
No IÃ‚'m not a deceiver
But I canÃ‚'t bring myself to admit that IÃ‚'m blue

And itÃ‚'s been this way
For quite a while
Yes, I forget how to smile
IÃ‚'d like to rely on my old game and yet
Even that I forget
ItÃ‚'s not there, I regret

The clock and the calendar
Both an assault
Time goes so slow














It must be my fault
I act like IÃ‚'m okay
When IÃ‚'m not okay at all

I forget what to do
I forget what it all means
DonÃ‚'t remember if love ever really felt good
I forget to be here
And not in-between
IÃ‚'d put on a good show
If only I could

And itÃ‚'s been this way for quite a while
Yes, I forget how to smile
IÃ‚'d like to rely on my old game and yet
Even that I forget
ItÃ‚'s not there, I regret
I forget

Have tantrums like silver slanting rain 
Walk up to strangers
Parade with my pride 

And stride like a lion up 
A mad mountainside 
So steep, so lovely 
Don't think about the fall 

Then suddenly, no warning
No nothing, I`m small 
I'm small
Smaller than anyone, smaller than you 

You see, I'm really the kind 
To cower in the corner 
And pray that some guy 
Will have a kind word to say 

Then be tiny in his arms 
And be stroked to my heart 
And coaxed and caressed 
And combed and undressed 

Then finally I'll trust him
Abandon it all 
Then suddenly, no warning
No nothing, I`m too tall 

I'm tall, taller than anyone
Taller than boys 
I'm tall, taller than anyone
Taller than you 

The pendulum swings both ways 
And I lose my equilibrium 
I swing so fast inside it's motion
That I become the hum 

I become the hum
You see I'm really the kind 
To walk the avenues 
And criticize the mannequins 

And ogle the jewels 
Justify spending the cash 
I don't have 
Break resolutions 

With a naughty little laugh 
I'm nothing unless 
I'm the belle of the ball 
And then suddenly

I flirt with the notion of no more songs 
My old familiar foe, self pity, haunts me 
I'm stuck in some over-the-mountain town 
In a meaningless bar where fat hands
Round the steiners 
And no one cares if it suns or pours 
In an hour between trains
Barney puts the record on 
And the aimless rise to dance 
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
I see you, George, in your 
Apartment on Riverside Drive 
Some fifty years ago
Your fingers on the keys 
Looking for the song
Looking for that hook 
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Who were you then? 
Did you have a woman? 
Were you hard up for cash? 
Did you ever know you'd be heard in 
The middle distance 
In some over-the-mountain town? 
Connecting to the muscles of the dancers 
In this close and smoky room 

Who were you then? 
Were you sure of your tune? 
Or were your dreams and your courage all broken down like mine? 
Now there's something that clutches the heart
A melody that stays
 
Year after year 
I love all the many charms about you 
Above all I want my arms around you
I'm already late for my train
But I don't think about that 
I think of you, George
At your piano, sweating in the summer heat

By the way, did you get your girl,
Did you by your house in the country? 
Did you wait for something that never came? 
Did you die still waiting for your train? 
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama 
Come to mama do

Some part of your heart twists and turns in mine 
Your soul rises 
There's an angel in charge 
There's one note that weeps the truth 
And makes my life mean something 
Just for the length of

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama, 
Come to mama do

What a perfect night
Secrets lights up the sky
Like fireflies do
ThereÃ‚'s nothing but a silky hope
That old opiate
Between me and you
DonÃ‚'t look now
WeÃ‚'re just about there
WeÃ‚'re just one little breath away
From our affair
From our affair
DonÃ‚'t move too fast
DonÃ‚'t run scared
WeÃ‚'re just one surrender away
From our affair
DonÃ‚'t you feel like
YouÃ‚'re coming down with something
Some great fancy flu
DonÃ‚'t you feel like youÃ‚'re
Coming down with me
And it doesnÃ‚'t get sicker than you
DonÃ‚'t you feel like this is the really good part
Where itÃ‚'s still up in the air
The perfect romance is never
Stated or sated, deflated or fair
DonÃ‚'t admit it yet
And donÃ‚'t stop saying your prayers
WeÃ‚'re just one little heartbeat away
From our affair
From our affair

ThereÃ‚'s a light in my window
And a little red ladybug in my hair
Just one turn down an empty street
Away,away, away
From our affair
From our affair
ThereÃ‚'s a white-hot desire
Of which I am pleasantly aware
Just one more ""wait a minute baby""

Some flecks of white, but mostly brown
Purple surprises riding in on a nerve
Begins to excite you before it settles down

It's after the knives and the sutures and needles
I'm left with an arrow that points at my heart 

I call it the seat of my sentimental sorrow
Gone seems to be one of the sum of my parts

And the night is cold
As the coldest nights are
There's a wise woman
She comes from an evening star
She says: Look for the signs
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
Follow your scar

A man I knew once said he wanted to see me
I said I'd been sick but was on the mend
I told him a few of the overall details
He said: That's too bad
And he's never called me again

What a gift in disguise that poor little puppy
So scared of misfortune and always on guard
A big man will love you
Even more when you're hurtin'
And a really big man
Loves a really good scar

'Cause the dawn breaks
And it's breaking your heart
There's a wise woman
She sits at the end of the bar
She says: Look for the signs
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow

Some flecks of white, but mostly brown
The world has tilted but
The world has expanded
And the world has turned

Run with the red deer 
And sing with the wind 
The magic lasts 
And meaning will follow

Strength from memory 
Like a tree on the wind 
Show me your scar 
And I will make it better",Scar,2000

The wind is filled with songs,
So many songs.

In just another minute
We'll laughing about you
To the untrained eye
It wouldn't look suspicious

We, your dearest friends
Don't really care if you have needs
Your hopes and dreams
Are trivial by your standards
We make fun of how you sing
And then we imitate your speech
And the stupid things
You say we like to slander

But we won't reel you out too far
'Cause after all, we need you for
Our ongoing quest

We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
It annoys us

We remember how
You bought us all those gifts
You liked to make us think
You were so generous
Be careful in the future
Of everything you say and do
'Cause it can and will be used
Against you by us

We your dearest friends
Judge you ""guilty""
Here and now
Of thinking you're a star
When it's all over
Nobody wants you
And we the least of all
It's been a long time since
You had those famous lovers

In faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us

It's not the straw
No, it's the final straw you'll say
Finally you've grown a sturdy backbone
There'll be no invitation to
Your rocky coast this year
Your queenly voice will
Ice us down the telephone

You'll never guess who's joining us
For brandy later on
That's right, it's your bete noir from hell
That's who
Are you worried we might spill the beans
Are you worried we might tell
About your little visit to the bin when
You were cuckoo?

But we won't reel you out too far
'Cause after all, we need you for
Our ongoing quest

We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
It annoys us

Toying with your paranoia

You have an unforgivable personality
Unforgettable, yes
We were so happy once in the Garden of
The Finzi-Continis
Oh, yes we were
Never more, never more
Here comes the waiter
We'll just put it on your house charge

Carly Simon,"I have no need of half of anything
No half time, no half of a man's attention
Give me all the earth and sky
And at the same time add a new dimension
Half the truth is of no use
Give it all, give it all to me
I can stand it
I am strong that way

Give me all night
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Give it to me anyway
Give me all night
'Till the last star fades
And if you can't take my heart and soul
Take it from me anyway

Don't give me fountains, I need waterfalls
And, when I cry my tears'll fill an ocean
The pain of love I'll accept it all
As long as you'll join me in that emotion
Half of lovin' is no fun
Give it all, give it all to me
I can stand it
I am strong that way

Don't leave me guessing alone
Don't walk me half the way home
You can do that tomorrow
Just give me give me all night.",Give Me All Night [Single Version],2002
Carly Simon,"There's a hand that's old and rough
And it's holding on
To one that's new and small
Whose life has just begun
Hand in hand
Young and old
Calm each others fears
Christmas is almost here

There's a rocky road ahead
Two people walk alone
Wondering in the fading light
If they can find their home
When hope is almost gone
A distant light appears
Christmas is almost here

Almost here for those in doubt
For those who must remain
Left behind when love goes cold
And shifting life makes change

Almost here for dreamers
Who think that there's a chance
That they will find their music
And a partner for the dance

There's a dream that doesn't die
Now we walk as one
Justice has a gentle hand
And love is like the sun

The darkest night is past
And by the stars we steer
Christmas is almost here
Christmas is almost here",Christmas Is Almost Here,2002
Carly Simon,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,2002

Another year over, a new one just begun.

Maybe I will draw a picture
And while I'm busy doing that
My mind will wander off somewhere

It's her quiet mission to tidy up her place

She hops around, she mops the ground, she fusses over you

Will know just what to do

It's a mother's intuition to wash her baby
Well, she won't forget behind the ears
And the extra soap suds on the tail
A mother's into cleaning, she'll clean until she's through
She's smart enough, she's wise enough to add up two and two

A mother with her intuition
Will know just what to do

A mother has a feeling, she pays special attention
If someone is concealing, if someone's playing tricks
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets
Until the answer clicks

Then she takes a brush and polishes your teeth
She'll make you shine and sparkle new
Until she finds the real you underneath

Isn't it charming?

Fresh as a daisy
Sparkling just like new

There's better living
Let them go their way
To that new living
I won't ever stray
'Cause this is heaven to me

Long as freedom grows
I want to seek it
If it's yes or no
It's me who'll speak it
'Cause the lord, He knows
That this is heaven to me

If you've got your hands
And got your feet
To sing your song
All through the street
You raise your head
When night is done
Shout your thanks up to the sun

Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes

I'm just as blue as the sky

Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly, little mem'ries, my little mem'ries
Remind her of our crazy schemes

And strangely enough, I got along without her

Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!

Carly Simon,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing",Midnight Clear,2006

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. 
Remember me to one who lives there.

Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown. 
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain 
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call. 

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt: 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme; 
Without no seams nor needle work, 
Then she'll be a true love of mine. 

On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves. 
Washes the grave with silvery tears. 
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun. 
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call. 

Tell her to find me an acre of land: 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme; 
Between the salt water and the sea strand, 
Then she'll be a true love of mine. 

War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions. 
General order their soldiers to kill. 
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten. 

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather: 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme; 
And gather it all in a bunch of heather,

As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
Drunk and lying with the gutter in her face

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

You think she knows the bible
And can swin the English Channel
Writes novels in her spare time
In a cabin in her woods
You wish I'd gone to college
And you wish I'd let my hair grow
You wish I didn't have so many moods

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am

Once you said you were in love with me
And maybe you still are
But the passion you once showed me
Now is lost among the stars
And you fancy some new fancy girl
Will come and change your life around
But she just turned the corner in her car

While for some other dreamin' driver
I am that romantic stranger
Lookin' better than I am
More mysterious by far
Speeding through his dreams
While I'm drivin' in my car

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

Carly Simon,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again

Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

So I came in here

Ain't it clear that

Carman,"There's a silent war that's raging deep within me
My lower nature fights to dominate
My spirit man is poised and locked in battle
With the carnal side of me I've grown to hate.

The trumpet of my prayers plays toward Heaven
A voice of desperation in my cry
Lord, strengthen me that I might not yield myself to sin
But keep Your righteous banner lifted high.

CHORUS
Lord, I hunger for holiness
And I thirst for the righteousness that's Yours
That my mind would be cleansed
And my spirit renewed
And this temple that You dwell in would be pure.

The tempter stalks about me as a lion
Searching for the slightest scent of blood
For when the skin of my resistance is broken
He moves in swiftly to deepen the cut.

Oh, Lord of all Creation, hear Your servant
You understand the weaknesses of man.
I'm counting myself crucified with Jesus
Alive to Christ and dead indeed to sin.

CHORUS",Hunger for Holiness,1993
Carman,"I was still aware of those around me
I could hear their cries and sense their grief
But was physically incapable
Of responding to them in any way

There was surprisingly no sensation of death
But without doubt, I knew I was dying
As my spirit and body naturally
And without effort began to separate

An entirely new dimension of reality unfolded
Like the slow opening of a rare flower
Celestial mysteries were revealed from beyond

The atmosphere was permeated
With the healing melody of an invisible choir
And I knew I had entered the domain of the living God

My eyes beheld a vast concourse of souls from every nation
Dressed in the spotless garments of the redeemed
With a loud voice they echoed praises to their King

I saw a mighty throne around which was seated
Four and twenty elders with crowns of glory
And like the sound of rushing waters they began to sing

Holy, holy, holy
They sang
Holy, holy, holy
I heard them say
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

They said
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy is Lord

The whole principle of living was different
Food and water wasn't needed to sustain life
There was no mental agony, tears
Source of tears or any physical pain

Light did not come from one source like the sun
But God's glory illuminated everything
So shadows did not exist, neither did elemental changes
Like snow, storms or even rain

Then, in all of it's pristine graduer, I saw the Holy City
Suspended like a cube at the expanse of eternity
Fifteen hundred miles high and just as deep as it was wide

Indescribable colors were refracting everywhere
From the precious stones it was made of
With twelve angels guarding the gates
Fashioned from one solid pearl on each side

Then, from behind me, I could sense the presence
Of one whose virtue shot through the very fibers of my being
As I slowly turned, a glorious radiance consumed my eyes
His silhouette was backdropped by the immense sea of glass

And for the very first time
My eyes beheld one altogether lovely
The Lily of the Valley, the Fairest of Ten Thousands
My Lord, my Saviour Jesus Christ
I threw up my hands and cried

Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

My soul said
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

His eyes were filled with tenderness
Encouragement, strength and love
His countenance proclaimed He knew everything
There was to know or ever worth knowing

Being with Him was to have everything I ever wanted
Be everything I ever imagined
And arrive at everywhere I only dreamed of going
Then the same Voice that spoke the worlds into existence
Spoke my name in affectionate tones

He said, ""My beloved child, there are those left behind
Who are deeply grieved at your death
They've prayed I return you to your earthly life
And because of their faithfulness to Me
I am willing to grant their request""

I said, ""Lord, if my loved ones only knew
The limitless wonders of Heaven
If they could steal but one brief glimpse of glory
I know what they would do""

""Because they loved me, they'd never ask
That I return to the confines of my human body
Lord, I can't go back, please let me stay with You""

For You are the resurrection of the life
The Son of the Living God
You're the only one worthy of honor
And glory and power and praise

Master, only You make all things new
For You alone are Lord and God, Saviour and King
And forever and ever, throughout all eternity
I'll join the hosts of heaven
As they praise You day, after day, after day singing

Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign
Lord of glory, lamb of God
And holy is His name

Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign

Carman,"Violently they grabbed His arms 
As they tightly strapped each wrist 
With the hellish looks that 
A strong armed soldier 
Whip clenched in his fist 
Laced with chips of bone 
They beat Him hard 
From His shoulders to His feet 
And it sliced right 
Through His olive skin 
Just like razors through a sheet

Countless times the blood splattered 
As each inhuman lash was given 
Several times His knees gave way 
As His flesh just hung like ribbons 
Then surprisingly He turned His head 
Though the words He used were few
The soldier's face turned pale 
When He said: ""This blood is for you""

Uncaringly they tossed a garment 
Across His weakened form 
And His blood pressure fell deathly low 
As the crowds began to swarm 
They forced Him to carry His cross uphill 
As His face they punched and smacked 
While the splinters from the crisscrossed beam Dug deep into His back

Through lack of sleep and dehydration 
His tongue began to swell 
And weakened by His loss of blood 
This Prophet, Teacher fell 
When He did some blood splattered 
On a man named Simon's shoe 
And as he bent to wipe it off 
The Prophet looked and said:
""Simon, This blood is for you""

This blood can save the soul 
Heal the sick, mend the heart 
This blood can give you access 
To the very Throne of God 
And it still can go the distance 
Through the pain to where you are
This blood is for you 
The blood of the lamb

Then they pounded a spike 
Through the bones in His wrists 
Bursting arteries and veins 
And as they dropped the cross in
The hole they dug 
His body convulsed with pain

Through an agony and torment 
That never a soul shall find 
He tilts His face towards heaven 
With full control of His mind
With more love than any human heard 
Before that time or since 
He made a statement that to this day 
Makes the strongest skeptic wince

He cried ""Father God, Forgive them, 
For they know not what they do"" 
And as He gave His life 
For those lost in sin 
He was saying this blood is for you

And this blood can save the soul 
Heal the sick, mend the heart 
This blood can give you access 
To the very Throne of God 
And it still can go the distance 
Through the pain to where you are 
This blood is for you 

If you're lost and alone

Been hurt and abused

Heal the sick, mend the heart

To the very Throne of God

Through the pain to where you are

Carman,"Party's over, shut it down, I'm huntin' for someone y'all

Every one of you unclean spirits
I'm runnin' you outta town, depression, strife
Disease and fear, your posse's goin' down

So I talk to you demons like dogs
Satan you coward, you molester of souls, I command you to appear
You're hidin' from the presence of God but
I can feel your fear from here

You rattled my chain, boy, long enough, you
Got something in your craw?
A praying church wants you to know, know what?
Your kingdom's gonna fall
There's gonna be trouble here tonight

'Cause I represent a whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a message to deliver from One who's true and just
We'll spit in your eye you father of lies
Satan, bite the dust!

Boy, you gonna take me on and my unholy herd?
Not only take you on, but take you out by the Spirit and the Word
One by one you'll drop  like flies under foot and in the ground
Because greater is He who is in me
Than the snake I'm starin' down

You demon of alcoholism, you'll be the first to go
There's deliverance from you through Jesus Christ, so, hit the road!
You spirit of infirmity you ain't welcome here no more
We lay hands on the sick  and they recover so, out the door!

You demon of false religion you've preyed on minds so simple
I bind the spirit of your songs, so el kabong! Play that in your temple!
Now Satan you're next in line, I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
'Cause I'm tired of you in  my family and I'm tired of you in my church

I'm not my own, I'm bought with a price, I'm a Holy Ghost filled man
And I'm tollin' the bell of your eternal destruction 'cross the land

'Cause I represent a whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and deputized to blow you clean away

One bullet is called the word of my testimony
And the other one's called The Blood

Carman,"93 million miles from the blistering surface of the sun hangs the planet earth.
A rotating sphere perfectly suspended in the center of the universe. 
The ultimate creation from an infinate mind. 
An unbelievably intricate complex design. 
A supernatural testimony, an irrefutable sign that there is a God.

The size, position and angle of the earth is a scientific phenomenon to see. 
A few degrees closer to the sun we'd disintegrate, a few degrees further, we'd freeze. 
The axis of the earth is titled at a perfect 23 degree angle and it's no mistake that it is.
This allows equal global distribution to the rays of the sun 
Making it possible for the food chain to exist.

Or take for example the combination of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere we breathe every day. It just happens to be the exact mix that life needs to prosper, 
It doesn't happen on any other planet that way.

You see, the Bible says the invisible things of God are seen through His creation, 
To believe this is not hair. If there's a design, there's a designer, 
If there's a plan, there's a planner and if there's a miracle, there is a God.

[Chorus]
There is a hope, there is a light
There is an answer to all answers
There is a flame that burns in the night
And I know, I know, I know there is a God

The Scripture says the heavens declare the glory of God 
And the skies proclaim the work of His hands. 
If we allow our minds to drink in all the truth that surrounds the truth that just surrounds us, Creation itself with help us understand.

Did you know the moon controls the tides, it's the maid that cleans the oceans. 
Even the waves don't crash the shores in vain. 
The tides drag impurities from the depths of the sea, 
It's nature's constrant recycling chain.

It simply boggles the mind to think that the stars will rotate with such exact precision that it's true. 
That the atomic clock with an error factor of less than three seconds per millennium is set by the way we move.

Though they silently orbit, the sun, the moon, 
The stars are like celestial evangelists above. 
Who circle the earth every 24 hours shouting in every languages that there is a God. 

Atheism is the wedge under the foundation of our faith, 
Trying to topple our relationship with Christ. 
When the fool said in his heart, there is no God, 
He rejects the truth God painted on the canvas of the night. 

Atheism has never created an artistic masterpiece, 
Never healed a fatal disease or calmed a fear. 
Atheism has never still given answers to our existence, 
Peace to a troubled mind or even dried a tear.

For it's God who created heaven and earth and flung the stars in space and breathed in the handful of dirt and it became a man. 
It's God who sits on the circle of the earth and measures the mountains in a scale, 
And holds the seven seas in the palm of His hand. 
It's God who sent His only begotten Son to the cross of Calvary to save our souls from Hell and the grave. 
It's God who creates, God who delivers, 
God who heals and God who is worthy of a thunderous ovation of praise.

Carman,"Webster's dictionary say a riot is like an unrestrained
Uproar in a public place, turbulent right in your face
With the facts we're gonna spread God's Word

Like the doctrines of men that are still fallen prey
To the silvery sword of God's Word today
It's true, we look to Heaven and our mansions in the sky
And it's true we've got the gaze of eternity in our eyes

But before this church is raptured
There's no way we're gonna leave here quiet
We want a righteous invasion of truth
We want a R.I.O.T.

Jesus, we're callin' on Your name
Jesus, we're gonna see a change
Jesus, we're taking on Goliath
With a righteous invasion of truth
We want a R.I.O.T.

Righteous, to conform to the Bible
Invasion an armed attack
Of truth, the real state of affairs
Like a church on the move that will not double back

From the fight, 'cause we're salt and light
And we thrive on Jesus, the theme of our lives
And here's the spin
Love nothin' but God, hate nothin' but sin

It's true, now's the time to win nations for the Lord
And it's true, now's an hour, the saints must go to war
We'll preach it, we'll sing it, we'll shout it, we'll cry it
'Cause desperate times need desperate action

Carman,"George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
Samuel Adams, First Chief Justice John Jay
Names synonymous with the spirit of our country
Founding fathers of the U.S.A.

Over 200 years ago they shook off the chains of tyranny from Great Britain By divine call
Citing 27 biblical violations they wrote the Declaration of Independence
With liberty and justice for all

But something happened since Jefferson called the Bible the cornerstone
For American liberty then put it in our schools as a light
Or since ""Give me liberty or give me death"", Patrick Henry said
Our country was founded on the Gospel of Jesus Christ

We eliminated God from the equation of American life
Thus eliminating the reason this nation first began
From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead
You need God in America again

Of the 55 men who formed the Constitution
Fifty-two were active members of their church
Founding fathers like Noah Webster who wrote the first dictionary
Could literally quote the Bible chapter and verse

James Madison said, ""We've staked our future on our ability to fallow
The Ten Commandments with all our heart""
These men believed you couldn't even call yourself an American
If you subvert the Word of God

In his farewell address, Washington said, ""You can't have
National morality apart from religious principle,"" and it's true
'Cause right now we have nearly 150,000 kids carrying guns
To these war zones we call public schools

In the '40's and '50's student problems were chewing gum and talking
In the '90's, rape and murder are the trend
The only way this nation can even hope to last this decade
Is to put God in America again

The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for America is him
If we repent of our ways stand firm and say
We need God in America again

Abe Lincoln said, ""The philosophy of the schoolroom in one generation
Will be the philosophy of the government of the next""
So when you eliminate the Word of God from the classroom and politics
You eliminate the nation that Word protects
America is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime
Number one in illiteracy, drug use and divorce
Every day a new holocaust of 5,000 unborn die
While pornography flood our streets like open sewers

America's dead and dying hand is on the threshold of the Church
While the spirit of Sodom and Gomorrah vex us all
When it gets to the point where people would rather come out of the closet than clean it
It's the sign that the judgement of God is gonna fall

If there's ever been a time to rise up Church, it's now
And as the blood bought saints of the living God proclaim
That it's time to send the alarm from the Church house to The White House
And say, ""We want God in America again""

I believe it's time America to stand up and proclaim
That one nation under God is our demand
And send this evil lifestyle back to Satan where it came from
And let the Word of God revive our dying land

For Jesus Christ is coming back again in all His glory
And every eye shall see Him on that day
That's why a new anointing of God's power's coming on us 
To boldly tell the world you must be saved

Because astrology won't save you, your horoscope won't save you
The Bible says these things are all farce
If you're born again you don't need to look to the stars for your answers
'Cause you can look to the very One who made those stars

History tells us time and time again
To live like there's no God makes you a fool
If you want to see kids live right
Stop handing out condoms and start handing out the Word of God in schools

The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for America is him
If we repent of our ways stand firm and say
We need God in America again
(repeat)

We need God in America

Carman,"Webster's dictionary say a riot is like an unrestrained
Uproar in a public place, turbulent right in your face
With the facts we're gonna spread God's Word
And attack every lie you've heard

Like the doctrines of men that are still fallen prey
To the silvery sword of God's Word today
It's true, we look to Heaven and our mansions in the sky
And it's true we've got the gaze of eternity in our eyes

But before this church is raptured
There's no way we're gonna leave here quiet

And we thrive on Jesus, the theme of our lives
And here's the spin
Love nothin' but God, hate nothin' but sin

It's true, now's the time to win nations for the Lord
And it's true, now's an hour, the saints must go to war
We'll preach it, we'll sing it, we'll shout it, we'll cry it

Carman,"If tonight you stood in heaven's court
To seek eternal favor
Would you face Jesus Christ as judge
Or face him as your savior
There are many who don't quite know for sure
What the verdict would be, if ever

So let's imagine for a moment
You are standing dead center
In the courtroom of forever

Sitting before you is a structure
Massive and intense
It's here where your fate will be determined
Before this judge's bench
Then a voice booms
""This court's now in session""
And your adrenaline starts to rush
Peering down with eyes that see through your soul
Is God the Father your judge

Then off to the left across the room
Is the virtual silhouette of sin
Stepping out of the shadows of condemnation
Your worst nightmare walks in
On his face is the smirk of evil incarnate
His mind fixed on your destruction in hell
You've just been introduced
To your prosecuting attorney
None other than Satan himself

The bible says he's the accuser of the brethren
So guess what he's gonna do
He's gonna accuse you of your sins
And he knows them all
Both the old ones and the new
He's prepared his case for years
Now the golden moment is his
So in arrogance he presents his case to the judge
And it comes out sounding something like this

""God, you see this worthless 
Piece of trash over here
This one is a sinner to the core
This one's committed adultery
Cursed his neighbors, stolen money
Been into drugs, alcohol and even more
This hopeless wretch has even 
Slandered his friends
And by the guilty face 
The whole courtroom can tell
That to a moral certainty
And beyond any reasonable doubt
This one deserves eternal judgment in hell""

The words of accusation still echo
Your every sin thrown in your face
Then God opens the book 
Where every deed is recorded
And reviews your records of disgrace
God says, ""The book says you did this, this
And this and everything you were accused of today
Now before I sentence you to hell forever
Are there any last words you have to say""

Now if it's true, you were standing there
In the courtroom of eternity
With God to your front
And Satan, the persecutor to your left
There's one remaining eternal truth
One that's crucial to remember
One you should never, ever, ever forget

Then, on the other side of the courtroom
(Doom music)
I said, on the other side of the courtroom
(Doom music)
You ain't hearing me tonight, I said
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTROOM
(Doom music)

Is the one and only Son of God
Revealed in time and space
And he's your defense attorney
Who has never lost a case!
It's not Buddha, Muhammad or Krishna
Or any others who succumb to death
Ladies and gentlemen
On the other side of the courtroom
Is Jesus Christ of Nazereth

Then Jesus jumps up, says
""Now wait a minute judge, I got something to say
May I remind you that on a cross, 2,000 years ago
I washed his sins away, I was crucidied, I died
They put me in the tomb
About the midnight hour the power of God hit me 
And I walked out of that grave
Alive and well, with resurrection power

Then the devil says
""It's in the book
It's written in the book
Check the book""

God said, ""Okay""
Then he takes the book out, lays it open and says
""Now we'll see what this book has to say""

He turns to the first page, the second, the third
By the fourth, the devil seemed shook

God closes it says 
""The blood of Jesus must have worked
'Cause there's absolutely nothing in this book""

The devil says 
""Now wait a minute, check that book again
All his sins are written, they're all right there""

God says, ""Devil
Maybe you're mistaken all together
Maybe it's this other book down here""

Devil cries
""NO!!  Not that book! Not that one!""

God said
""Devil, why are you so uptight?""

God sets the book down, the dust flies
And on the cover it says ""The Lamb's Book Of Life""

~ Singing ~

Is your name in that book?
Is your name in that book?
Is your name in that book for sure?

If you've been forgiven and your name is written
Then raise your hands, praise the Lord

Yes, my name's in that book
Yes, my name's in that book
Yes, my name's in that book tonight

I've been forgiven and I know my name is written

Carman,"Listen up now ya'll I'm gonna try and reach ya
Class is now in session pay attention to the teacher
We're goin' through the Book, Genesis to Revelation
I'll teach your head how to spread salvation to the nation

We'll start with the basics, a checklist for the saints
Love the Lord with all your heart and mind and soul and strength
To fear the Lord is wisdom, to serve the Lord divine
To really break it down just repeat these words of mine

[Chorus]
I love Jesus... (I love Jesus), Yes I do (Yes I do)
I love Jesus... (I love Jesus), How 'bout you?... (How 'bout you?)
I love Jesus, Yes I do, I love Jesus...How 'bout you?

Grab your pen and paper, the lesson now begins
First up Church artillery 'cause we at war with sin
God trains us through evangelists, apostles, prophets too
Pastors, teachers, five in all 'cause we got work to do

Discernment, tongues, interpretation, prophecy, and faith
Wisdom, knowledge, healing, miracles, yeah, those are great
These gifts are like atomic bombs, they make the Word explode
But they just don't mean nothin' unless you know the code
That code is...

[Chorus]

The bottom line, the way to win
Is up with Jesus, down with sin
The Word is clear, easy to see
Only Christ can set you free

Hide the Word in your heart
When you grow you won't depart
Grind the devil to the ground
Sunday school is throwing down!!!

I love Jesus... You love Jesus... We love Jesus, how 'bout you?

That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1998

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Carmen Bradford,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say?

How can it be the same?

That in your eyes I may not see forever..

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2009

What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size

Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""

Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance

""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood""

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping

In the mood his crazy loving
In the mood what I was missing

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

A liberarmi imponendo oltremodo la tua ostinazione
Sei venuto a riprendermi

Conducimi alla luce del giorno Portami con te non lasciarmi

Carmen Consoli,"Carissimo signor Tentenna 
non ÃƒÂ¨ facile assumersi il rischio di una scelta 
e servirsi addirittura di parole proprie, 
mimetizzarsi e vivere di luce riflessa 
in fondo ad acque torbide 
tra miseri inganni e menzogne, 
complessi di inferioritÃƒÂ , 
ingombranti manie di grandezza. 

Signor Tentenna non ÃƒÂ¨ motivo di vergogna 
il non saper centrare alcun bersaglio, 
l'aver mancato l'ennesimo colpo irrimediabilmente. 

E ben poco importa se tua moglie 
non fa altro che piangere 
ossessionata dal sentore 
dei tuoi numerosi tradimenti, 
ingurgita ignoti dolori 
ed elevate dosi di calmanti. 

E' ormai consuetudine, Signor Tentenna, 
perdersi d'animo, non essere all'altezza 
delle proprie ambizioni 
e sgomitare per distinguersi dal branco. 
L'ignoranza ÃƒÂ¨ un non trascurabile complesso, 
una voragine, la si puÃƒÂ² occultare nel silenzio 
scansando il pericolo di un mite confronto diretto. 

Signor Tentenna non ÃƒÂ¨ motivo di vergogna 
il non poter vantare alcun talento, 
l'aver rincorso l'ennesimo treno inutilmente. 

E ben poco importa se tua moglie 
non fa altro che piangere 
ossessionata dal sentore 
dei tuoi numerosi tradimenti 
e in fondo non ha tutti i torti 
e non ÃƒÂ¨ affatto un caso se 
amanti, amici e sogni si dileguano, 
il cane sul balcone aspetta da mesi 
il privilegio di una passeggiata 
eppure la sera fedelmente esulta 
al tuo rientro.

Carmen Consoli,"Questo pensiero d'improvviso mi scuote
E annienta ogni pudore ed ogni difesa
Avevo soffocato quella stupida attitudine
Ai voli pindarici ed alle struggenti eroiche attese
E sopravviverÃ² a questa mancanza di ossigeno
Malgrado le insidiose correnti arriverÃ²

In fondo agli abissi tra antichi splendori
Di un mondo sommerso da migliaia di anni
Stupidamente ho temuto l'immensa e spietata
Bellezza la profonditÃ  dei tuoi occhi

Questo pensiero rende soave il risveglio
Scomodando il torpore la consueta pigrizia
Rivivono fragranze estinte e tramonti d'incanto
Le grandi speranze travolte dall'ira di oceani in tempesta
Avvolta da una prodigiosa atmosfera Atlantide

Sorride intatta e volge un sguardo amichevole

E non possono audaci parole nutrire illusioni
E l'inverno che bussa alla porta

Prima dell'alba potrebbero sorprenderci
Rapiti da un sogno dove nitide acque divorano i nostri passi sulle rive di Morfeo
Ci stanno accerchiando ed avanzano con passo accorto come belve in agguato
Fuggi Romeo il tempo Ã¨ tiranno
Non Ã¨ d'usignolo ma di allodola il canto

Carmen Consoli,"Elettra metteva la cipria consueta nella penombra 
Negli occhi il riflesso di sensi abusati e bagliori di strada 
Inquieta per l'ultimo appuntamento 
Qualche minuto e lo avrebbe rivisto. 

Da giorni in conflitto con quel turbamento 
Sublime ed affine al dolore 
Quell'altalenare tra stato di grazia e sfiancante passione 
Quel giovedÃ¬ sera alle dieci e quaranta 
Un confuso languore, l'odore di neve 
Forse era ansia di prestazione 
Il colmo per una che fa quel mestiere 

Elettra quale audace acrobazia 
Toccare il cielo con un dito e poi ridiscendere 
Amato bene abbracciami alla luce del giorno 
Tra sguardi indignati e la frenesia del resto del mondo
Amore concediamoci quel viaggio imprevisto 
La fuga dal solito itinerario costretto alla morsa dell'abitudine

Perdona il ritardo 
All'altezza del bivio 
Fui colto da ignoto malore 
Le gambe inorganiche, lastre di ghiaccio
improvvisa necrosi del cuore
Per grazia divina la mente Ã¨ rimasta 
Illesa ed immune a ogni trepidazione 
Vengo a saldare il servizio d'amore
oltre seicento gradevoli ore

Carmen Consoli,"Ottobre era il mese piÃ¹ dolce
I baci e le carezze sotto lâ€™albero di limone
Lâ€™uva era la nostra refurtiva preferita, la vendemmia
Una sacrosanta tradizione di famiglia.
Ottobre era il mese migliore
Per scorgere I tramonti che infuocavano lâ€™orizzonte.
Trafelate ci alzavamo e con disinvoltura
Rientravamo in scena con le gote rosse ed una buona scusa.

Quel crocevia,
Unâ€™imminente decisione da prendere
Piuttosto che il limbo avrei scelto lâ€™inferno
Fosse stato il prezzo della libertÃ .
Il paradiso poteva anche attendere
Fosse stato il prezzo della libertÃ 
Lasciare tutto e accontentarsi di niente
GiÃ  bastava il fatto in sÃ© di esistere
Riaprire gli occhi e lasciarsi sorprendere
Ottobre infinito candore
La nostra adolescenza appesa ai moti altalenanti del cuore
La fuga diventava unica e sola via dâ€™uscita,
Un tuffo al buio necessario negli abissi di una nuova vita
Quel crocevia,
Unâ€™imminente decisione da prendere
Piuttosto che il limbo avrei scelto lâ€™inferno
Fosse stato il prezzo della libertÃ 
Il paradiso poteva anche attendere
Fosse stato il prezzo della libertÃ ,
Lasciare tutto e accontentarsi di niente
Dare voce a una nascente identitÃ

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth

Mmm, mmm 
Flavors, so many flavors 2 choose from 
All delectable in their way, it's very hard 2 choose just one 
So as I think slowly and try 2 decide 
Out of all the lovely treats, just which one am I? 
It's hard 2 say 'cause I'm a special blend 
People will try 2 put me in 
A category 4 which there is no room 4 expansion 
Don't you see that move is doubtful? 
Because the fruit is bountiful 
Turn me over slowly and I guarantee a mouthful

Easy does it, take your time 
Tasty, now you know the meaning of the line 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 

And now that you've had a taste, could you waste a dropful? 
Of a nectar so sweet guaranteed 2 keep you youthful 
A hot tasty hors d'oeuvre 
Or better yet, what would you prefer? 
Hot fudge over ice cream topped with whipped cream? 
Passion is in the fruit and I can't stand it 
If it could be bottled, people would be demanding it 
And that would be just 2 scandalous 

Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
So as I simmer basted with a touch of honey 2 give me a glimmer 
Or should I say shimmer of sweetness 
Pound 4 pound I can see no weakness

If you think you're praising me then don't even bother 
Excuse me, I don't think they heard me 
Turn it up a little louder 
Cool, here we go 

Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
Hmm, I'm feelin' effervescent, refreshed, lively 
Never mind, girlfriend over there who despises me 
She doesn't even know my name 
That's OK, you should have an attitude when you play this game 
These days it's very hard 2 be chosen 
'Cause most of us try 2 play like ice cubes frozen 
But that'll get you nut n' honey

And the smell of sugar and cinnamon looms 
Aromatic in its blend 
And there's plenty 4 you 2 choose from on the menu my friends 
So take your time 
And every now and then try something different and you'll find 
Variety is the spice of life that keeps it finger-lickin' 
Ah, that wasn't no ordinary chicken 
Ha, ha, ha, you better believe it 
And at this moment I think it's time I release it

And it's my choice
Somebody's trippin', I
Feel myself slippin' away
Lights flashin', music
Playin' as I grind in my cage

Carmen Leggio,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Carmen Lombardo,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

Carmen McRae,"Lover, when I`m near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame

Lover, when we`re dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing, music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you`ll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you`re tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

(instrumental bridge)
Lover, it`s immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn`t continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you`re tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart","Lover, Come Back to Me",1958
Carmen McRae,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun [#][*],1958

I look for my heart
It`s perdido

And that`s when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, adios

I know I must go to Torito

Flying so freely
We seem to really
Touch heaven higher
Higher, ever higher

On your wings
Where the light falls
And then when night falls
Stars dance above

Giving a show
For the people below

So high

Of the motor's repeat
With a sigh, baby
By and by

I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Learning to enjoy at my leisure all the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
That this is all I ask, this is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than Spring

They honored Noel Coward

I follow Winchell, and read every line

Should cause you such misery and pain

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I"" You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Good old friend of mine
You've been reaching for yourself
For such a long time
There's so much to say
No need to explain
Just an open door for you
To come in from the rain

It's a long road
When you're all alone
And a man like you
Will always choose the long way home

There's no right or wrong
I'm not here to blame
I just want to be the one
Who keeps you from the rain
From the rain

And it looks like sunny skies

Wiser, I know I am

But it doesn't matter
Cause I love you anyway

Have forgotten half their promises

What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

It's love at last I have someone to cheer for
It's love at last I've learned what we're here for
I've heard it said, ""You know it when you see it""
Well, I see it and I know it, it's love",It's Love,1992
Carmen McRae,"As Dorothy Parker once said
To her boyfriend, fare thee well
As Columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
It was swell, Isabel, swell

As Abelard said to Eloise,
Don't forget to drop a line to me, please
As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear,
Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If wed thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
Wed have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

If wed thought a bit, of the end of it

Carmen McRae,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1992
Carmen McRae,"Supper time
I should set the table
Cause its supper time
Somehow I'm not able
Cause that man of mine
Ain't comin' home no more

Supper time
Kids will soon be yellin'
For their supper time
How'll I keep from tellin'
Them that man of mine
Ain't comin' home no more? 

How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where hes gone? 
How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on? 
How can I remind them to pray at their humble board? 
How can I be thankful when they start to thank the lord
Lord!

Supper time
I should set the table
Cause its supper time
Somehow I'm not able
Cause that man of mine
Ain't comin' home no more",Supper Time,1992
Carmen McRae,"Three little words
Oh what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days
And what I feel in my heart
They tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clear-early
Three little words
Eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you-ou
And what I feel in my heart
They tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clear-early
Three little words
Eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you
Simply mean I-I love you-ou",Three Little Words,1992
Carmen McRae,"It's hard to learn 
How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, cause I'm in a mess

My faith has gone 
Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

I'll go along hoping 
Someday you'll learn
The flame in my heart, dear,
Forever will burn!",Yardbird Suite,1992
Carmen McRae,"You leave me breathless
You heavenly thing
You look so wonderful
You're like a breath of spring
You leave me speechless
I'm just like the birds
I'm filled with melody
But at a loss for words
That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart
You leave me breathless
That's all I can say
I can't say more because
You take my breath away",You Leave Me Breathless,1992
Carmen McRae,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I pine, for you dear only
Why haven`t you seen it?
I`m all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging
I tell you I mean it
I`m all for you, body and soul

I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it
That you`d turn away romance.
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
Unless I can have
Just one more chance, dear

My life a wreck you`re making
My heart is yours for just the taking
I`ll gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul",Body and Soul,1992
Carmen McRae,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore,1993
