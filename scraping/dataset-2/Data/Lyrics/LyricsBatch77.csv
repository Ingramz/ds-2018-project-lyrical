It's almost closing time
And We can toss down one more shot
Before last call
Are you ok? 
I swear to god
I gotta get out of this house
I miss the days when I'd just
Not come home at all

Now don't you cry, it'll give you lines
Around your eyes
You gotta try not to live so much of
Life alone
And If I see you getting crazy by the bottom
Of the bottle I'll
Take you home, take you home, take you home

Remember when we used to stumble
Down the boulevard
From bar to bar untill we couldn't
Stagger straight
We felt like we would live forever,
Living life was not so hard
We felt nothing much at all but it felt
Great

Now don't you cry, it'll give you lines
Around your eyes
You gotta try not to live so much of
Life alone
And If I see you getting crazy by the bottom
Of the bottle I'll
Take you home, take you home, take you home

I gotta tell you,
It gets better
Every day you stay alive
And I'm amazed
Every day
That the sun decides to rise
Every minute, every hour, is another
Chance to change
Life is beautiful & terrible & strange

Now don't you cry, it'll give you lines

Concrete Blonde,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

Well now I think I make a right
If I remember yes, I think maybe tonight
I may do better when the moon is up and bright
Where I last saw you; what a sight, what a sight
(Iâ?¦ shed your skinâ?¦ I'm comingâ?¦ shed your skinâ?¦)

Between the canyon and the sky
Where you can't hide, you can't hide
The desert sky has a million eyes
And the stars are on my side
(Iâ?¦ shed your skinâ?¦ I'm comingâ?¦ shed your skinâ?¦)

I think I feel you in the sand
Not far away; tiny tremors of the land
I lay and wait
I'll see your eyes, your big white eyes
They won't see me
But you and I will meet tonight
Under a Joshua tree

And return to the ash that once sustained them

Conducting from the Grave,"A blackened night has cast its shadow upon the skies 
Not a sound to be heard from where the buried bodies hide
Ceased from flowing are the rivers that seem to be touched 
By icy hands of death himself In the graveyard by the crypts where the dead rest 
Scribed into markers show the names of long forgotten 
But all that's seen among the graves are the countless stones that lay
Weathered 

And all that's heard among the ruin is the sound of endless calm 
Beneath the mounds of unturned earth lay the restless gaze of the ones kept 
Entombed 
Confined to the crimes of our spent lives 
We long to curse the stars Awake 
Bring back to life what was taken 
And tell the tales of our lost souls 
Endure this pain no longer 
Break free from our prisons made 
No tears we've shed No longer go wasted 
Return to us what you've taken away 
Repay the crimson veins that you have slit 
Repair the broken souls you've soiled
Horrendous sights 
Spine chilling realizations
Bloodcurdling sense
Unnerving all who's seen 
Destruction bound 
The ones that silenced us
Confined into the abyss 
Ride through the eventide 
Just to see the dawn of day 
For a chance to feel alive 
And when we see the stars and scream into the evening sky
We will curse the day that we were born 
Curse the day that we were born 
Awake all those who dream 
All seeking solitude 
Your time has come to change your fate 
And bring the courage of a million hearts of men 
To desolate all who stand in our way 

No longer will we forfeit the years we spent working for our gain 
All of the tears we've shed are no longer wasted 
Awake 
Bring back to life what was taken

Conducting from the Grave,"Birthed from the cocoon of lunacy 
A child raised by the seed of dementia forming 
Fatherless daughter of false poisoned tongues 

She moves upon her own path of madness astray 
From fear that she will soon be used like scum  
Hypnotic to her victims that she chooses to suck dry 
Hypocritic, Parasitic lies 

You wretched filth, mark my words, your life shall be taken by my hands 
I'll tear the pulsing bag of shit from your chest and burn it before your eyes 
Upon your grave I shall stand as a monument of hate that will never move
And I will smile in content at your passing in my malevolence

Conducting from the Grave,"Lowly do I sit, the night lay dormant as I muse the thoughts 
Of lives passed, and reason with forgotten lore 
Remembering within these halls, the curves around your face 
Beauty lost; apparition haunting me, dancing in the pale moonlight 
Such silence profound in the night 
Until a ravens cry shatters repose 
In the cold of winter nights, my hands are splintered from the beating 
Of my fists upon the bloodied floors 
A sanctuary lost within these hallowed halls, such emptiness abound 
Such silence deafening to ears, but what's this pounding on my chamber door? 
As if striking a hammer to bones 
Is this the tone of my taker 
As I count the days and nights 
Watching shadows pass before my eyes 
Years begin to crawl 
And I shall hear your voice cry forevermore
And as this silence evolves with each heartbeat that echoes its fears 
And in halls I shall hear your voice scream forevermore 
And as the shadows grow long
Within the light that now fades in the mist 
And in halls I shall remain in darkness forevermore 
Confined in abysmal time 
Showing no signs of release 
Detained in horrific eyes 
Piercing with a gaze of remorse 
But there he rides on the winds of this gloom 
And there he howls with an unearthly wail that shakes me
I sit and try to gasp for air, my chest is tight from apprehension 
From this beast that dares to perch and mock my woes 
Repeating shrieks of nevermore this wretched hound abounds and vexes me
Peering into my soul with hate, like hell fires spawned behind his gates 
Is he the one that will take me away 
To lay among the worms 
As I sit and stare the pounding palpitates the pulse of blood that's frozen 
Through my veins like lifeless corpse in rest 
This ravens daunting prophecies have sparked a revelation in my mind 
That all of this, my purgatory, shall repeat until I'm under stone 
And still this creature insists that he crows 
His demoniacal sight As I count the days and nights, watching shadows pass before my eyes 
Years begin to crawl 
And I shall hear your voice cry forevermore 

And as this silence evolves with each heartbeat that echoes its fears
And in these halls I shall hear your voice scream forevermore

Waiting for the light to abandon their prey 

Oh mindless Revenants, I summon thee to gorge upon the helpless, the docile and frail

Walls crawl with the lurid shades of the deepest pits of hell 
Devoid of time the pendulum swing arrests to an end 
Gone is the illusion of solace and sanctuary 
Replaced by abominations and visions of heinous shadows 
And nothing can stop them 
Lurking at the end where one dares enter slumber 
Caressing the silken sheets with the coldness of the dead 
Unholiest of nightmares dwell inside 

Where visits of the damned will have you begging for your life
And there is no escaping what yearns for flesh suspended consciousness reviled 
Such bitterness at rest will have you clasping for cherished light that has been smothered 
By the hands of fiends 

Lungs collapse from the weight of being that one cannot see
Demonic grasp bound the limbs and torso forcing down slowly crawling upon its victim laying in fear 

Pounding upon the chest with ungodly strength that shreds the very soul of a man 
Taunting are the howls that sill this foul scene 
Driving one to madness with its zeal to plague

Keepers of unholy sleep drown our thoughts with horrors of our hell
With horrors of our hell

Drowns out the loudest screams, takes pleasure in silent cries

Conducting from the Grave,"The endless battle wages for our minds but we will win the fight 
For we shall not be broken

Every instance of struggle through time is just a test of strength to challenge our right to remain 
Sublime, the will to dethrone ourselves with the failings of fathers by feeding the fathers
By tempting the tempest but by braving the storm and breaking the bonds of which we forged 
Were reborn and eternal this will not be the reason we fade
We will not let our legacy end
We must rise to vanquish all that hinders us 
And pave the way for brighter days but these monuments remain on these walls remain the 
Stains of the blood that will not wash away 

Now we move to save this age against ourselves
Born into struggle
We live to only breathe and die
With no one knowing our truth
But we can change
And see this world reclaimed, renewed

With our devout design through the endless storm a single light remains and we retain it
But will we have the hope that it will carry us through what has clouded our lost eyes in every
Act of trust we leave what's holding us and cast aside our fears reclaiming all that's our taking

Conquered fear laying waste to what has hindered us",We Who Shall Conquer,2010

I have seen amassed decaying ideals crumbling before the storm 
Where, destined to be ripped apart by its greed and emptiness 
This age has seen its days only to be consumed by the souls of man 

Lives lead to brave the lines of impurities and wickedness 
And those who have been lost shall remain astray 
Cast out and branded 
Left to drown in an ocean of liars in endless tides 

A chance no one will take to change the fate of which their bound 
On time we will surely see the end 
Where all will fall apart 
Into the sea 

I witnessed so many failures built by the architects of misshapen dreamers and beggars 
Bluntly nailed to crosses of their own design 
Lost between the translations 

Praying to be of the less deserving of the fate the were given 
Bestowed by our judgments 
In time we will surely see the end 
Where all will fall apart into the sea 
Severed into nations 
Then built on empires we have lost 
To be renewed to define self righteous in our ignorance 
And we feed on plagues 
As we fall unto our doom

Venom, Bugsy, Ese Bandit
Soy Conejo
You vatos ready to ride
Where's all my motherfucking killers at
That's right, that's the way it's going down
Vatos better watch your back
Check it out

I wore a glass house to the weed spot
To pick me up a sack so I could smoke to the head
While Box got a beat at the studio that's cracking
I get at this hunny making money from dancing
Call me up when you're off, I'll be laying a verse
It's all about the feria so first thing's first
I get up in the booth and I handle mines
I'm semi-automatic homey rhyme for rhyme
And what that means is that Conejo no joke
I let the pistol barrel smoke then I take me a toke
I get blown, call shots in the zone
Where vatos play for keeps simulating Al Capone
Hit a switch and if anyone trip
See the burban right behind me, it got plenty of clips
Don't slip, I'm here to catch ya
Right between the eyes, bye bye I'ma blast ya

[Chorus]
Let's ride till we lay them down
Bang bang, everybody ese no matter what side
Let's ride till we lay them down
Bang bang, everybody ese no matter what time
Let's ride in a '63 Chevy
Ese vatos breaking down but I hold mine steady
Let's ride in a '49 bomb
I don't want to be right if the barrio's wrong

Let's ride to see the writting on the wall
Big ass blocks about fifty feet tall
Shaded in, don't know where to begin
Just know I'm in the calles trading sin for sin
Let me in, I'll tell you once that's all
Then I'm kicking in the door with my gauge sawed off
Gun point, I said she's coming with me
Get your things babygirl then jump in the Chevy
I got beats that'll make you got and drop some pills
And I don't think you want to cross me with your dope fiend skills
Camaradas from all over ese got my back
Break bread with the calles while these others get taxed
They collapse because I'm heavy in weight
I'm fresh out the joint, calisthenics, no weights
Back up, 'cause I ain't got no friends
Just twenty five riders in the streets, Dead End

[Chorus]

Vatos hold it down with the shanks and rounds
Tattoo Ink tearing up the town
Then back to the park where the gangsters hang out
Caravaning through the barrio, outsiders get ran up
Say what, there's a high risk factor
Impala '65, let's go jack these rappers
Snappers is what these broads be saying
'cause vatos from the area ese don't be playing
We be serving every night, get your plate don't wait
Got the big cooking rocks on the block that's hot
Come on dog let's go get this cash
And rob the connection, gotta be quick to blast
To my perros locked down doing time in the pen
Consider this a kite, I'll get at you tonight
And to my faction, all the fallen soldados
I came to put it down ese for all you vatos

[Chorus]

Let's ride
Let's ride homies
Let's handle our business
Let's ride
Vatos don't want none ese
That's right
I want to say what's up to my homeboy Torrance
Let's ride
San Quintan death row
We ain't forgot about you

One day she saw him starin', and it chilled her to the bone
She knew she had to see that look on a child of her own

[Chorus:]
'Cause ladies love outlaws
Like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
Outlaws touch ladies somewhere deep down in their soul

Linda was a lady, blonde and built to last
Billy was a no-good guitar picker runnin' from his past
Listenin' to his songs she heard nothin' but bad news
Still she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose

REPEAT [Chorus:]
Jessi liked the Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands
Waymore had a reputation as a lady's man
Late one night her light of love finally gave a sign

Confederate Railroad,"We were poor when I was a youngun
I don't remember ever going hungry
Daddy made sure we didn't do without
I went to school with some of these fellas
They had money and I was jealous
I didn't know then what I know now
Daddy'd say you can't judge a book by looking at its cover
It's what's inside that really matters

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

I left home right out of high school
Bought me a big car thought I was real cool
Cruisin' around the old neighborhood
I'd see Dad after church on Sunday
I'd say you'll have to go riding with me someday
He just said no, I never understood
He asked me how I bought it, I told him on credit
Daddy just smiled, I'll never forget it

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

It took a while but now I'm grown
I've settled down with kids of my own
The more I give them
The more they want

Daddy left us last November
I don't remember him ever looking better
All laid out in his Sunday best
I'm sure instead of all the attention
All he'd of wanted was a few words mentioned
A simple man simply laid to rest
As they drove him away in that big Cadillac
With a tear in my eye I had to laugh

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy

What kind of girl I want
I'd pick a Georgia peach or a Mississippi queen
Or a Dallas debutant

But I met a little blonde from above and beyond
The Mason-Dixon line

Lord, she more than qualifies

She likes Elvis, she likes Andy
She's just as pretty as can be
She's the number one fan of
Both Graceland and Mayberry RFD

She ain't a southern belle but it's hard to tell

But mama through a fit 'cuz she wouldn't eat her grits
It was looking like the civil war

I was hoping like the devil that they would meet up in the middle
But neither one would budge
Then I heard them in the kitchen a-laughing and a-giggling
Singing hunka hunka burning love

Out back in the tool shed

For cocaine nights and reckless days

To make one last journey home 

Near a small white church in the valley 
Beneath a wooden bridge 
Patiently we waited on the cold Alabama ground 
And the preacher he started preaching 
About our life and about out times

As we laid his body down

While your politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess
Maybe you could honor my small request

Add another day to make the weekend last
Get your head out uncle Sam, somebody needs a hand
Toss a little bone to the working man
Toss a little bone to the working man

Make it a law that we all get a raise
And prices go a little lower every day
Where pretty women can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you'll always go far

I build your bridges and I carry your loads
I move the big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn
Seems like I ought to get a little return

While your politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess

And prices go a little lower every day
Where pretty women can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you'll always go far

I build your bridges and I carry your loads
I move the big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn

You don't have to say anything, nothing, but it is advisable (but still your choice) 
to give your name, address and date of birth, and then say nothing else 

If you don't give them this you'll find they will only hold you for longer

The police are cunning but thick, don't hand it to them on a plate 
You don't have to give your fingerprints, make them apply for a warrant 
This sometimes is refused - especially if the evidence is flimsy 

Never let them take your photograph this is only compulsory after 
You have received a prison sentence, so don't let them tell you different 
You can demand suitable food; you might not get it ""keep on asking"" 
You are entitled to make phone calls but the bastards won't let you 

Remember the arresting officer's number, or any scum that treat you badly

There's one, two, three

It means that you are no longer prepared to sit back and allow terrible,

cruel things to happen.
The camerman in Ethiopia took direct action,

he filmed the worst disaster that has ever happened to human beings.
He 
Realised it was too enormous a problem to handle himself - so he took the 
Films home in the hope other people would help.
They did.
Are you prepared 
To sit back any longer?
Direct action in animal rights means causing 
Economic damage to those who abuse and make profits from exploitation.

START! 

It's possible to do things alone,
Slash tyres,
Glue up locks,
Butchers,

burger bars,
The furriers,
Smash windows,
Bankrupt the lot.
Throw paint over 
Shops and houses.
Paint stripper works great on cars.
Chewing gum sticks 
Well to fur coats.
A seized engine just won't start,
Sand in the petrol tank 
Means that delivery's going nowhere.
When the new death shop opens up make 
Sure you're the first person to be there.
If the circus comes to town 
Remember what goes up must come down.
Stop contributing to the abuse 
Yourself - don't eat meat,
Don't buy leather.
Buy non-animal tested make up,

herbal soap and shampoo's better.


Try and form a group of people that you know that you can trust and plan 
Ambitious direct action,
Sometimes risky but a must.
Only when you have 
Animal liberation will we obtain human freedom,
When the last 
Vivisectionist's blade is snapped.
It will be that one step nearer to peace.

Direct action in the animal movement is sussed and strong,
And our final 
Goal is not far off.


Animal lovers,
Vandals,
Hooligans,
Cranks; recognise the labels?
They say we 
Don't care about human beings.
We say all sentient beings,
Animal or human 
Have the right to live,
Free from pain,
Torture and suffering.
They say 
Because we are human and speak the same,
We matter more.
Is our pain and 
Suffering any greater or lesser than that of animals?
Human v.
Animal rights 
Is as much a prejudice as black v.
White or the nazis versus the jews an 
Affront to our freedom.


Vivisection is a violation of human beings,
The same as it is for animals.

We have a chemical world built on a pile of drugs to thanks for their 
Experiments.
Drugs are designed for profit,
Manufactured to suppress 
Symptoms.
Human freedom,
Animal rights.
It's one struggle,
One fight.

When animal abuse is stopped then human abuse will soon stop also,
An 
Attitude of mind.
""An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind"".

Start by protecting the weak,
The defenceless,
Animals,
The sick,
The 
Disabled.
Compassion and emotion are our most important safety values.

If we lose them,
Then 'we lose' the vitality of life itself.

Emotional?
Hooligans?
Cranks?....

When met with resistance, they stamp on it until it breaks 
Their society remains secret and although we know their name 
We are the pawns on the world?s chessboard in one big multi-national game 

There's still no end in sight but still we know we?re right 
We must somehow struggle on up while they go racing to the top 
Then Whitehouse ""V"" the squat, a challenge I think not 
Resist every move they make by fulfilling our own hearts 

Not by backing off and dropping out, get in there for a start 
If you're looking for some proof of this how much more proof do you need 
When constantly and hopelessly we fail and they succeed 
There's no compassion in here 

My fingers keep curling into fists these days 
No one smiles on the streets these days 
And there's no compassion 
Hit the wall a substitute for a face 

You can look but you can't touch 
You can see but you can't have 
Keep crawling to the end of the week 
And there's no compassion 

Breath heavy to pretend it?s fun 
Raise the cover to protect your pride 
Ignore the failure that you see in the glass 
Paint the flesh to hide the scar 

And there's no compassion 
A million people died in the middle of your breakfast 
A million people died in the middle of your favorite love song 
A million people died in the middle of your racist joke 

A million people died in the middle of your favorite TV programme 
A million people died in the middle of your lovemaking 
A million people died in the middle of your pop stars interview 
A million people died in the middle of your video game 

A million people died in the middle of your sexist 
A million people died in the middle of your mass debating 
A million people died in the middle of your politicians lying

A million people died in the middle of your royal variety performance 
A million people died in the middle of your debutante?s ball 
A million people died in the middle of your day out at Ascot 

A million people died in the middle of a Conflict gig! 
Separation is complete. A mind to domesticate, condition, compete 
Clinical birth control, the sterlised setting 
Syringed into being, life is just beginning 

Mask of the surgeon, eyes of the blind, rubber band caressing, welcome to mankind 
The brain perceives the fear, tender beats the heart 
Slapped into life programming starts 
Wanted and needed 

Wanted from birth to fit in the jigsaw puzzle 
Trained don't strain against the muzzle 
Force-fed, prostituted, brainwashed that's called learning 
Blindfolded, prejudiced, an outcome predetermined 

Needed to die and not question why 
Follow in ignorance, a comfortable prison 
Kept in the dark so they can be free. Spit in the eyes so you will never see 
The kid aims the cap gun, points it at my cranium 

I am supposed to put my hands up, but I don't want to die that way 
Mentally or physically, para-psychologically, whose responsibility? 
Is it to feed their profiteering tolerated as long as your mind is fearing? 
Right where they want you beaten back into submission 

Right where they want you in a missionary position 
Needed to promote their glory of possession 
To accept and be grateful yet ask no questions 
To believe in love and their guiding hand 

To obey in humility and never understand 
I was feeling alright, yeah just me and the night; I was walking through a white tiled subway 
I heard the sound of voices around the corner shouting 
The sound of broken glass, no one was there 

I looked at my reflection in the puddles in the street 
It looked so messed up I just kept moving my feet 
To the beat and rhythm of my heart, not much I know but I see it as a start 
Because I'm counting the heads to see how many are left, the fingers of one hand stretching 

And this feeling of apathy keeps coming quite suddenly - 
Well if something?s gonna come, when's it coming? 
While you're jumping on the spot, all the freshness starts to rot 
And another inspiration fades away. And still you sell your dignity 

Still you sell your dignity time after time 
And I wonder where lies your pride, does it wait in there inside? 
Is it waiting for the moment when you let your heart speak? 
Is it waiting for the moment when you act out your own beliefs? 

Is it waiting for the moment when you drop your false act? 
Is it waiting for the moment when you face the facts? 
That you're pumping your life for someone else?s ideas 
That you're living your life under someone else?s fear 

That it's time to shift your vision, time to move your head 
Get up out of submission. I'm counting heads, how many are left? 
The fingers of one hand keep stretching. The fingers of both hands keep stretching 
And all I see is ""Rock ?n? Roll"". All I hear is ""Rock ?n? Roll"" 

I turn the pages of the book, and force my weary eyes to look 
At the product of our modern world, at the product of our civilised world 
And a child?s face looks out at me, questioning why does this have to be? 
And I can't find any answer, not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear? 

It's been said that we must progress for humanity, but looking at the truth of that mockery 
I wonder if our minds have progressed anywhere, and I wonder if there's any humanity there 
The sightless eyes looking at me, questioning why does this have to be 
And I can't find any answers not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear? 

If you're an activist not while getting pissed, 
If you're gonna do something make sure you don't miss 
That's a dangerous game to play what use are you if you're banged up? 
You can't beat them on the streets, so duck and dive a little, hide the fiddles 

Play them at their own game, stay with them all the way 
Know what and why they are doing things and create alternatives 
Police are still snooping, awaiting the big nick 
Like fishermen baiting the fish, tempting us to take the risk 

This time, this time they've made the impossible.

Should I be feeling this loneliness?

Fue imposible olvidar que algun dia yo te quise 
Tanto tiempo pasó desde el dia que te fuiste 
Ahi yo supe que las despedidas son muy tristes 

Nunca me imagine que un tren se llevara en su viaje 
Aquellas ilusiones que de niños nos juramos 
Todos tus sentimientos los guardaste en tu equipaje 
Quiciste consolarme why me dijiste yo te amo 

Desde entonces no supe que seria de tu vida 
Desde entonces no supe si algun dia regresabas 
Los amigos del pueblo preguntaban si volvias 
Llorando di la espalda no les pude decir nada 

Ayer que regresaste al pueblo 
Alguien me dijo que ya te casaste 
Mirame why dime si ya me olvidaste 
Me marcharé con los ojos aguados 

Despues le pregunté a la luna 
Me dio la espalda intento ocultarse 
Hasta la luna sabe que me amaste 
Hasta la luna sabe que aun me amas

Why vuela vuela por otro rumbo 
Why sueña sueña que el mundo es tuyo 
Tu ya no puedes volar conmigo 
Aunque mis sueños se iran contigo 
Tu ya no puedes volar conmigo 
Aunque mis sueños se iran contigo 

*Y que sigan volando compadre, con Atardecer oiga*

Es tan triste tener que decirte que me olvides 
Otro amor ha llegado a tu vida why estoy triste 
Es muy tarde why no puedo negarte que me muero 
Pero no callaran mis palabras pa' decirte 

que soñaré contigo siempre que cierre mis ojos 
Que entonaré por ti mis cantos tristes noche a noche 
Que lloraré sin ti cuando recuerde que estoy solo 
Al recordar que duermes en los brazos de aquel otro

Me pregunto si aun reflejas algo de mi vida 
Si en tu memoria vive aquel amor de tantos años 
Aquel tonto que siempre te quiso desde niño
Que llora porque el amor de su vida se ha casado 

Es triste ver que un tren se aleja 
Why en el se va lo mejor de tu vida 
Dime el motivo de tu despedida 
¿Por que te fuiste dejando mil penas? 

Un dia recibi tu carta 
Quice leerla why era una hoja en blanco 
Pues de tu vida nunca supe nada 
Como preguntas que si aun te amo

Mira que tu jugaste a los amores cuando lo eras todo en su mirada

Y en cada verso pone su corazón
Al yuyo de suburbio su voz perfuma

Tal vez allá en la infancia su voz de alondra

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Muy adentro de mi alma
No sé explicar el sentimiento
Que me causa tu mirada

Sin darme cuenta te empecé a querer
No se me olvida lo que sentí
Cuando te vi por primera vez

Sentí de repente el amor y la suerte
Al contemplar tu presencia
Todos mis sentidos quedaron
Rendidos ante tu belleza

Sentí en mi cuerpo el correr
De la sangre despertaste mis ganas
Sentí la ternura que mi amargura
Había dado por muerta

Sentí en tu voz el calor del amor
Que me roba el aliento
Desde que te vi a mi Dios
Le pedí dormir en tu cielo

Sin darme cuenta te empecé a querer
No se me olvida lo que sentí
Cuando te vi por primera vez

Sentí de repente el amor y la suerte
Al contemplar tu presencia

Conley Graves,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,
Conley Graves,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

An old cow polk went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin' through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo
The ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

(Yippee-I-yay) yippee-I-yay (yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo
The ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you want to save your soul from hell aridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Ah tryin' to catch the devil's herd across this endless sky'

It's not a foxtrot or a polka

And I'm deep in a dream of you.
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.
Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing;
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

The look you gave in answer to my pleas,
These are the things I love.

My heart was cold;
And then you came to me,

You turned the silver to gold.

The babbling brook beside our rendezvous,
your sweet voice whispering, ""Darling I love you!"",

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Connemara Stone Company,"In the merry month of June, from me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darlin' mother
Drank a pint of beer me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghost and goblin
A brand new pair of brogues, rattlin o'er the bogs
And frightenin' all the dogs on the rock road to
Dublin.

One, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road, another way to Dublin
Whack fol-laddie-ah! 

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city
So then I took a stroll all amoung the quality
My bundle it was stole all in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin
Enquirein' for the rogue, they said me Connacht brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rock road to Dublin

One, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road, another way to Dublin
Whack fol-laddie-ah! 
 
From there I got away, me spirits never failing
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing
The captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy

Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 We're living in a world of stars and dust 
Between heaven and all that surrounds us 
We're travellers here, spirits passing through 
And the love we give, is all that will endure 
Hey now, what we had is gone 
But I still remember you 
Just like a rose after the rain 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 Now the darkness falls, the sun's going down 
One by one, the stars are coming out 
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand 
As one day ends, a new day must begin 
Hey now, though we are apart 
You're here forever in my dreams 
Hey now, love is lost and gained 
(What you gonna do about it, what you gonna say) 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 And you wonder sometimes how we carry on 
When you've lost the love you knew 
But it's alright, it's alright 
To your own heart be true",Something Beautiful Remains,1991

Connie & Babe,"On one cloudless morning I stood on the mountain,
Just watching the smoke from below,
It was coming from a tall, slim smokestack
Way down on the Southern railroad.

It was 97, the fastest train
Ever ran the Southern line,
All the freight trains and passengers take the side for 97,
For she's bound to be at stations on time.

They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Saying, ""Stevie, you're way behind time.
This is not 38, but it's Old 97,
You must put her into Spencer on time.""

He looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman,
""Just shovel in a little more coal,
And when I cross that old White Oak Mountain
You can just watch Old 97 roll.""

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville,
And the lie was a three-mile grade,
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes,
And you see what a jump that she made.

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour,
When his whistle began to scream,
He was found in that wreck with his hand on the throttle,
He was scalded to death by the steam.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And at 1:45 he was due,
For hours and hours has the switchman been waiting
For that fast mail that never pulled through.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And that poor boy must be dead.
Oh, yonder he lays on the railroad track
With the cart wheels over his head.

97, she was the fastest train
That the South had ever seen,
But she run so fast on that Sunday morning
That the death score was numbered 14.

Now, ladies, you must take warning,
From this time now and on.
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband.
He may leave you and never return.",Wreck of the Old '97,1995

The walls of my room fade away in the blue,

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.
Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing;
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing

Connie Britton,"I wish that i didn´t have to see
A confident is an enemy
the lines you cross
helplessly I can only watch

imagine words as they ricochet
honesty that will never pay
your convictions I believe
like an apparition haunting me

Now the truth is a ball
and chain holding my conscious to the flame
covered up but still i know
the secret of a life you’re guilty of
the smoking gun is what I found
the dirt I have on you is the ground
Oh, I’m buried under

Try to tread through sink and sand,
In your way, you know i can´t stand
What I thought was meant to be,
Is a broken heart weighing over me

when the clever wolf is the one you love

Connie Dover,"It was homeward bound one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamt a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

As I was wandering on some foreign shore
I heard a lady and she did deplore
She wept aloud and to me did say
Oh, my loving husband, he's so long away

With a hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where these poor sailors do sometimes go

They sailed West and they sailed East
Their ship on oceans of ice did freeze
Only the Eskimo in his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin Bay where the whale fishes blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Franklin alone with his sailors do dwell

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I would cross the main
Ten thousand pounds would I freely give
To say on earth that my Franklin does live
To say on earth that my Franklin does live",Lord Franklin,2000
Connie Dover,"Have you heard tell of sweet Betsy from Pike
She cross the wide prairie with her lover, Ike
With two yoke of Oxen, a big yellow dog,
A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

One evening quite early they camped on the Platte
'Twas nearby the road on a green, shady flat
Betsy, sore-footed, lay down to repose
In wonder Ike gazed on his Pike County rose

The Indians came down in a wild yelling horde
And Betsy got scared they would scalp her adored
Under the wagon wheel Betsy did crawl
She fought off them Indians with musket and ball

Out on the prairie one bright starry night
They broke out the whiskey and Betsy got tight
She sang and she shouted, she danced on the plain.
She made a great show for that whole wagon train

The Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that morning was fried
Ike got discouraged and Betsy got made
The dog wagged his tail and looked wondrously sad

They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
Ike in great terror looked on in surprise
Saying, Betsy get up, you'll get sand in your eyes

Sweet Betsy got up in a great deal of pain
Declared she'd go back to Pike County again
Ike, he just sighed, and they fondly embraced
And she traveled along with her arm round his waist",Sweet Betsy from Pike,2000

And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I

I leaned my back against an oak,
Thinking it was a mighty tree,
But first it bent, and then it broke
Just as my love proved false to me

There is a ship that sails the sea
It's loaded deep, as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

But when it's old, it grows so cold
And fades away like morning dew",The Water Is Wide,2000

And not your polyester tourist

Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

Connie Francis,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes

Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1958

Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

While above the heavens in their glory gleam

Just because they know a thing or two.

Telling of the wonders they can do.
You'll see wise guys and boosters,
Card sharps and crap shooters,
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear those flashy ties and collars,
But where they get their dollars,
They've all got an ace down in the hole.

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
That's their ace in the hole.
Others have girls on that old tenderloin,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips they are going to take,
From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,
If they lost that old ace in the hole.

Wherever you might stray, along the Great White Way,
They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.
But every hustler knows
Bullshit buys no clothes
And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,
But all of them have aces in the hole.

Drifters who dwell on that slippery slope,
Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

And flash a Missouri bankroll.

Connie Francis,"A lady known as Paris, Romantic and Charming
Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

Some place that's known to god alone

Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west

And nowhere else on God's green Earth

That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,1996

Much more than just the money he can make
And every woman knows a lot of joy and tears

The wedding cake is not all icing
And love and tender whispers in the dark
One slice is concern for all your dreams prayed
They won't come true and break your heart
Another slice is feedin' kids and wipin' noses
Cryin' when the doorbell rings and there are roses
Every woman knows a lot of give and take
Comes with the wedding cake

It's facin' shadows of the future
Prayin' they will fall away as we walk toward them
Searchin' for the sun
And it's long and anxious hours with the wolf at the door
Hugs and kisses when, at last, we see the dawn
So when the hands of time trace tellin' lines upon our face
And lace our hair with strands of gray
We laugh and say for all who will partake

It all comes with the wedding cake

And just forget about your troubles
And open up your eyes

And when you wear a smile
The world will shout, ""Hooray!""
You gotta turn on the sunshine
Your gonna put the blues away!

And just a little bit of sunshine
Makes it all a better place
You can chase away your troubles
When you got a happy face

When you wear a smile
The world will shout, ""Hooray!""
You gotta turn on the sunshine
Your gonna put the blues away!

If the world is sad and weary now
You don't have to be a politician
You can change it all
With a sunny disposition

So, be happy
And spread it all around
If you find yourself a-frownin'
Just turn it upside down

When you wear a smile
The world will shout, ""Hooray!""
You gotta turn on the sunshine
You gotta give in one time

You gotta turn on the sunshine
Put those blues away!

Man, this dialect is too much!",Turn on the Sunshine [#],1997
Connie Francis,"Where the boys are, someone waits for me  A smilin' face, a warm embrace, two arms to hold me tenderly  Where the boys are, my true love will be  He's walkin' down some street in town and I know he's lookin' there for me    In the crowd of a million people I'll find my valentine  And then I'll climb to the highest steeple and tell the world he's mine    Till he holds me I wait impatiently  Where the boys are, where the boys are  Where the boys are, someone waits for me    Till he holds me I wait impatiently  Where the boys are, where the boys are  Where the boys are, someone waits for me",Where the Boys Are [Japanese Version],1998
Connie Francis,"April love is for the very young
Every star's a wishing star that shines for you
April love is all the seven wonders
One little kiss can tell you this is true
Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But April love can slip right thru your fingers
So if she's the one, don't let her run away

Connie Francis,"Jealousy, night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder, if this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody, for I know no one but me 
Has won your heart, but when the music starts

My peace departs from the moment
they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all it's charm again
This jealousy that tortures me, is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
You eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe, when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love. 
 
I feel that the music will end

Connie Francis,"Well I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night
Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you you got me singing the blues
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine

Well I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay

Connie Francis,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation

Connie Francis,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1998
Connie Francis,"They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word

This love will last though years may go

And then some day they may recall
