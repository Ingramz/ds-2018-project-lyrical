Robert Meadmore,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
",There But for You Go I,1988
Robert Meadmore,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you at all.

No, never could I leave you at all.",If Ever I Would Leave You,1995
Robert Meadmore,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love [From Brigadoon],2009
Robert Mellin,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1998
Robert Merrill,"But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be

If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.

Well, anyway, you mean you don't love me.
That's what you said, isn't it?

Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah?
The blossoms. The wind brings 'em down!

Billy there ain't much wind tonight
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.

And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.

I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there

There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.

You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?

No!

Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like

What?

Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-

Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.

But you don't!

No, I don't!

But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you.

Aha I'm not the kinda fella to marry anybody!
No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to,
I wouldn't!

Julie
Don't worry about it, Billy!

Billy
Who's worried?

Julie
You were right about there bein' no wind.
The blossoms are comin' down by theirselves.
Just they're in time to, I reckon.",If I Loved You {*],1965
Robert Merrill,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1974
Robert Merrill,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining, 
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining. 
'Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. 
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
Fall on your knees! 
Oh, hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, the night when Christ was born, 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land. 
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger, 
In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
With all our hearts we praise His holy name. 
Christ is the Lord! 
Then ever, ever praise we, 
His power and glory ever more proclaim! 
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,1974
Robert Merrill,"Silent Night

Robert Merrill,"Is this the little girl I carried?
Is this the little boy at play?
I don't remember growing older,
When did they?
When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall?
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset, 
Swiftly flow the days.
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset,
Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,
Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.
Is there a canopy in store for me?
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset, 
Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.","Sunrise, Sunset",1995

Robert Merrill,"We'll be close as pages in a book
My love and I
So close, we can share a single look
Share every sigh

So close that before I hear your laugh

My eyes grow misty too

Robert Mitchum,"Let me tell the story, I can tell it all;
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol.
His daddy made the whiskey, the son he drove the load;
And when his engine roared they called the highway ""Thunder Road"".

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis town.
The Revenuers chased him but they couldn't run him down.
Each time they thought they had him his engine would explode.
He'd go by like they were standing still on ""Thunder Road"".

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they swore they'd get him but the devil got him first.

It was on the first of April, Nineteen-Fifty-Four
The federal man sent word he'd better make his run no more.
He said ""200 agents were covering the state;
Which ever road he tried to take they'd get him sure as fate.""

'Son' his daddy told him, 'make this run your last.
The tank is filled with 100 proof; you're all tuned-up and gassed.
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through.
I'd rather have you back again than all that Mountain Dew.'

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they swore they'ed get him but the devil got him first.

Roaring out of Harlan; revving up his mill.
He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville.
With G men on his tail light; road block up ahead,
The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread.

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike,
Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike.
He left the road at 90; that's all there is to say,
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day.

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first.",Ballad of Thunder Road [*],1957

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

You're Camembert.

The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer

Robert Mosci,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on

Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You,2003

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days

To nights that never end?

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

I'll get the blues 'round about midnight
Early with the risin' sun
I'll get to thinkin' bout my sweet woman
And all the good she done
And my heart gets like a hammer
And my eyes get full a-tears
She only been gone about twenty-four hours
But it seem like a thousand years

Boys, I should have loved her more
But you know I didn't treat her right
Yes, I should-a loved her more
But you know I didn't treat her right
You take a woman like that
Need lovin' ev'ryday an night

Now the blues get-a pilin' up on me
But I brought it all on myself
When I should-a been lovin' my woman
I was out with somebody else
Now, here's a mighty hard pill to swallow
But I want all you men to know
You better mind what you are sowin'
Because you've got to reap what you sew

Boys, don't never dog your woman 
When you know you're doin' wrong, yourself
Yes, don't never dog your woman 
When you know you're doin' wrong, yourself
It'll put the devil in her mind
She will go wild about somebody else

Now, the river runs into the ocean
And the ocean po's into the sea
But if I don't find my sweet woman
Somebody got to bury me

Because I love that woman
Better than I do, myself, hoo
Yes, I love that woman
Better than I do myself, ooo
And it really breaks my heart
But I know she with somebody else.

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1997

Forever haunting your past will blind you to the love you do

Let's see if the gossip's true
Force of will or force of nature
It's only a point of view
I've seen you dancing on the floor
They don't make them like you no more
Bye, bye for now, I'll check you later
See you in a week or two

You can't get enough of a good thing
I can't get enough of you
I won't settle for less than you, girl
Because only the best will do, girl

O.K., so you ain't no saint, but I think you're heavenly
And I appreciate the rumours came from choreography
Last night when you came through the door
I swear I saw the wings you wore
And even though your halo slipped
I thank my lucky stars for you

Mad for my love
So long, Jonah, goodbye
How am I ridin'? I'm ridin' high

Floating on a starlit ceiling
Doting on the cards I'm dealing
Gloating, because I'm feeling so hap, happy

Blow horns, beat gongs

Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me

Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy, I could cry
You are so dear to me

Robert Pete Williams,"Lord I got myself on the pardon board
You know I got denied again
Been on the board three times
Each time I was denied
But I hope in the Good Lord

All around the board looking at them Peter's case
Lord they must have passed mine around and
Because they denied me again
Lord have mercy on me

I've been tryin', I've been tryin', Lord every day of my life
Please Lord have mercy on me

They would give me some kind of chance
Please please Lord give 'em hearts (?) the people round the pardon board
And Lord let 'em feel my sorry too

I fell down on my knee
I prayed, I prayed both night and day
Hoping they would help me Lord

Well I know my cases ain't too bad Lord
I just can't see, just can't see why they did me this way
Lord have mercy on my dying soul
I got, I got a big family on my hands
They's out there in that free world waiting on me to reappear
Oh Lord they want me to return again back to my home
Oh Lord have mercy on me

I got a man told me that he would write
Now a letter to the Governor for me
And I hope he would help me Lord
Praying to the Lord he hear my prayer

To you today
Please help me Lord

Robert Peterson,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

It's like I'm back in junior high
With a pencil in my hand
Taking notes on all the subjects
That I'll never understand
That's exactly how it feels when I think about
The wonders of your grace

It's so elementary
But still somehow
It's a million miles over my head
Some days I get it, some days I think
I'm never gonna comprehend

Your love goes on and on
And on and on and on for me
It's so profound and at the same time
It's so elementary

Someday I hope to finally graduate
And I'm gonna walk right through the heavenly gates
And I'll bet you'll teach me like a child again

Just like I'm back in junior high

Taking notes on all the subjects
That I'll never understand

And I'm sure you're gonna leave me amazed

Robert Plant,"Slipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance
How could I fall without a shove?
Tiptoe like thunder on my feelings
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are week, my head is reeling
Consumed by fire in your eyes

(Dont'cha know why, goodness no! Why?)
Stepped in and shattered my defenses
Just playin' hookey with my heart
Slipped through the window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart

Yes my poor heart
Try as I might, try as I may
Well I'd try anything to make you stay
'cause I need your love, yes I need your love
Ooh I need your love, yes I need your love
I'm lookin' high, I'm lookin' low
Tryin' to find where did my baby go
Gotta find out why she ran away
I don't know where did my baby stay
Try as I might, try as I may
Well I'd try anything to make you stay

Just find that Boulevard d'amour
Shoot through a neon in the night
Hot-foot through alleys, check the doorways
Try that old parking lot on 9th
There's 3-course-kissing in the same way
Oh but that don't help me none no more

Little girl ain't I seen you before?

It happens each day
It's ill-conceived
Just throw it away

It's hard believing
Dancing with time

To watch the waiting time slipping away
It won't be long now

People stand in line
Close by the water where the fishes swim

'Round and 'round to pass the time

Over and over just like before
Once in awhile you stop and say hello to me

Once in a while I think you noticed when I smile
That love still lingers in my eyes

I can't stay down for too long now baby
I can't stay down for too long now my baby
If I'm crying, well it's 'cause I'm lonely
You know I'm only ever lonely without you
If I cry, well it's 'cause I'm lonely

Robert Plant,"Dance by me close, tell 'em all to go
One's for the money, but I'm through with the show
Move with me gently, oh so slow
Hold me and maybe we'll never let go, never let go
I'm through with sneakin' been cutting it close
Through with the two-step, where the rhythm is law
Through with the two-step, where the rhythm is law
Oh, yes, it's love in any key
You opened up the door, now I know it's got to be

Now my cards on the table, hands on the deck
Now A is for able, no words, pause for breath
My willing baby, now can't you see
Little girl, it's not for me
So you waltzed into my life, one two three
Warmed up your smile, oh let it please be me, please let it be me
You swish and swirl, oh, swing and sway
Stay till the sun comes, and don't go away",Thru' With the Two Step,1983
Robert Plant,"Now, red is urgent, green's a let off
And the score shows just another spin off
Orange dance and brown in old
Grey is weary, don't touch gold
In the fireworks, away from the heat
Behind closed doors, away from the street
No-one is listening, at least that's what you think
Cause a slow fuse burns, much faster than you think

Like the new look, all that matters
Through the last one, back in the shadows
Purple each one (leaf swam?), yellow
Silver his wound, and don't touch gold
Dance through the colored razzamatazz

Spin alone desert affairs
Reckless love is creeping on you
Now watch her ways (Watch out, reckless)
'Cause reckless love will drive you crazy
Will wear your mind out (The way you wind up)
Creeps up on you when you don't know It'll find out, ah

Reckless love, reckless love
Oh reckless love, reckless love Oh yeah
Waste with my heart to the top of a kiss
Tried my desire to take in at your ears
Breakin' my heart for it's all I own

Crazy with my heart
Ah come on, in these times I'm alone
Crazy with my heart
Other the arms that held me so tight
Crazy with my heart
Stuck in my mind with you in the night
Feelin' reckless, feelin' reckless, reckless love

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh

Ooh reckless, oh, reckless love, reckless love
Reckless love, reckless love Reckless love, reckless love
Reckless love, reckless love Burn, oh baby burn
Feel it creepin' up on you Reckless love, reckless love

She's just as cool as ice, and every time she smiles
She is so professional, so professional

She's so professional, she's just as cool as ice
Every time she smiles, you know it's rather nice
She needs a confidante, you tell her you're the one
With the mouth that smiles, and then she has to leave
Never satisfied, as I light up my fire
She is so professional, so professional

Wouldn't do it to you, so don't you do it to me

Now I find I finally lost my reason, tonight

I wouldn't do it to you, so why you do it to me
I wouldn't do it to you

Which way that you want me to go

Come on baby, don't you be untrue
Been loving you far too long
I don't know where my love has gone
Ain't paying the price no more

Look down, almost with breath held as the time flies
I found, I'm lost in your reflection,

So when I wake, every night it's the same
Just lying there staring and confused yet again
And it's when I do that I fumble in the dark
For the line or the light from the tear in my heart
Here it comes again, oh, looking for you

And here it comes again And here it comes again
Now I've carried the torch I've uncovered the flame
But the friend I'd meet, it must have known me

Years keep spinning round and round
No words assured without a trace, like the shadows in the sun
No room for fools who rush~it's all been done

Putting troubles to the vote

Tired eyes slow dance in the sunlight
It's all a joke
Wheels keep spinning round and round
Years keep spinning round and round
With the passing of your time, though you seldom come to mind
I remember the day.
Sure as winter follows fall sure as maybe I will call, 
Just remember the day
Far off the hazy day
Long gone the lingering gray

Chill winds blow cold around the fire's glow
Farewell the call to arms, release the captive heart
Time's keeper clouds the skyline on the last resort
Wheels keep spinning round and round
Years keep spinning round and round
With the passing of your time, though you seldom
Come to mind, I remember

Robert Plant,"When I was born I was running
As my feet hit the ground
Before I could walk I was humming
An old railroad sound
Things didn't get much better
When by the age of five
They found me walking into Clarksdale
Trying to keep my friends alive

No time for celebration
There was no known cure
Seems I was born and raised
In the wrong killing floor
And my loved ones gathered round see
If the experiment had worked
I was misplaced, out of time
privileged and worse

Don't cry for me
Tears to the river
Tears to be free

Walking in a line
Moving east across the metal
Bridge on highway 49
And standing in the shadows
Of a burnt out motel

With his hound from hell, oh

A shiny noon riverboat taking
Income from the poor
It's floating by the levee in
an artificial pool
There's a six mile tailback
Back on junction 304
A stranger at the crossroads
Believe I've seen his face before

Oh,
Don't cry for me
Tears fill the river
Tears to be free

Broken lovelorn on your rocks,

Torn between his lover and the gun
Another god, another mother
Weeps to justify the damage done

I wonder through the lies and dirt
I wonder, will the meek inherit all the earth?
As truth collides with propaganda
Just another victim on the run

The world outside, all fluff and candor
Seeks to justify the damage done
No wonder, so much pain and hurt
I wonder, will the meek inherit all the earth?

I think there may be, a war in heaven
Paradise beneath the smoking gun
As every saint and small town savior
Race to justify their chosen one

I live on former glory, so long ago and gone
I'm turning down the talk shows, the humor and the couch
I'm moving up to higher ground, I've found a new way out

There's parasols and barbecues and loungers by the pool
The late night conversations filled with 20th century cool
My peers may flirt with cabaret, some fake the rebel yell
Me - I'm moving up to higher ground, I must escape this hell

Let me suspend my thirst for knowledge in your powder, sweat and sighs
A grudge of Christian women, a stain of spotless wives
A perfect destination inside a perfect world
I take the bottle to the baby, you take the hammer to the pearl

Like this

Every day's like Sunday, down here on memory lane
Salad days and no good ways drive me quite insane

And all my friends were gathering that day that I recall
I shivered and shook, Lord I stood just waiting to chase the fall
I wondered how my time would be when spring comes round once more

I face the wind, I have no choice, but you must guard the heart
And cast adrift from those I love, alone I drag my heart
Against the cry of ""why?"" I turn my back to go
But out beyond the tears somewhere, someone I need to know

It's only love, in the colors of the shade
It's only love, in the colors of the shade

Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers 
Inside a rain-drenched forest
But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel
The way I felt before 
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more 
The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground she walked upon
Those were good days
The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn, spring and summer 
And winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon
That's where she is
But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more

Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And she walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek

Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten",Last Time I Saw Her [Remix][*],2006

Robert Plant,"Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie

I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy, he's an outlaw
A wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade

He oversees his kingdom
No stranger dare intrude
His voice, it trembles as he calls
For another plate of food

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf

Your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a lark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Oh, to the valley below

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love.""

Said it could not be so,
Not with all the girls I know.
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes.

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise

Robert Plant,"Once in Persia reigned a king
Who upon his regal ring
Etched a caption true and wise,
Which, if held before his eyes,
Gave him counsel at a glance
Fit for every change and chance.
Solemn words, and these are they,
""Even this shall pass away.""

Trains of camels through the sand
Brought him gems from Samarcand,
Fleets of galleys through the seas
Brought him pearls to rival these,
But he counted not his gain
Treasures of the mine or main,
""What is wealth?"" the king would say,
""Even this shall pass away.""

In the revels of his court,
At the zenith of his sport,
When the palms of all his guests
Burned with clapping at his jests,
Amid his figs and wine,
He cried, ""O loving friends of mine,
Pleasures come, but not to stay,
Even this shall pass away.""

Towering up above the square,
Way up high into the air,
Rose his statue, carved in stone.
All disguised, all unknown,
Gazing at his sculptured name,
Asked to himself, ""What is fame?
Fame is but a slow decay,
And even this shall pass away.""

Sick and tired and fading,
Thinish, beat and old,
Stood a mile outside the Gates of Gold,
Speaking with his dying breath,
""Life is done, so what is Death?""
Then, in answer to the king,
Fell a sunbeam on his ring,
Blinding light through fading grey
""'Cause even this shall pass away.
Even this shall pass away.
Even this shall pass. 
Even this shall pass away.""

Robert Plant,"The Russians, the Americans, the British and their friends
They're carving up the world again, it's getting kind of tense
A whole lot of posture and very little sense
It's no surprise they hide behind a wall and not a fence

A damp and misty history, they're keeping to themselves
I'll often talk antiquity and smoldering descent

Ditch and wire and palisade in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Plan for catastrophe inside the house of cards

In China they got worried so they built themselves a wall
They built it big and long and tall to keep away the horde
A hundred years of burning toil, and many lives expent

Someone turned out the light
Our fields are plenty filled with clover
So long ago and out of sight
This little light that keeps on shining
All through the darkness, through the night
That evermore will keep reminding
Our journey's long, our flame is bright

And if there's one more time I can dance with you
Let me dance with you tonight
It's the last chance our hearts will dance 
Into a lover's light

Out in the land of neverending
The rich create their own delight
We saw the world forever changing
Through dancing days and wondrous nights
I'll offer up the secret places
Reveal the magic of the land
I'll earn my blood and lips to trace it
'Til time conspired to steal our crown

And if there's one more time I can dance with you
Let me dance with you tonight
It's the last chance for our hearts to dance
Into the loving light

Come on and bring me a late late smile
Are the flames still burning bright
Across the day, across the years

Only one more night
Come on and dance with me, baby
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright, feel alright
And if there's only, only one more, only more life
Come on in the dark or dance with me

Everyone’s talking black and white

And help me get my mind right

Robert Randolph,"Benedictine, sister to Isis and the black Madonna
Mistress of magic, goddess of the Nile
She could read the stars, knew the secrets of the dead
And could see what kind of madness
Was stirring around in your head

She said my birth sign is Scorpio
We eat ourselves up and burn ourselves out
So could somebody show me

How to become clairvoyant
To be one of the ones
Who can see around corners
And knows what's to come
How to become clairvoyant
That's what I gotta to know
So just tell me where to sign
And point me where to go

As it turns out Miss Muffett wasn't afraid of spiders at all
She slipped across the dance floor at the masquerade ball
They say she collects hearts the way Nero collected tears
And she don't get no older down through the years

Her lips are moving she's not talking
Her hips are moving but she's not dancing
She just wants to know

How to become clairvoyant
To be one of the ones
Who can see around corners
And knows what's to come
Oh how to become clairvoyant
That's what I want to know
Just tell me where to sign
And point me where to go

King poet the holy fool
Apostle of self-destruction
I tried it your way but I couldn't sleep
There's too much construction

In these strange times you wonder
What tomorrow might bring
If the fat lady sings

How to become clairvoyant
To be one of the ones
Who can see around corners
And knows what's to come
How to become clairvoyant
That's what I want to know
Just tell me where to sign
And point me where to go

Now that would be a revelation
And I also enjoy levitation",How to Become Clairvoyant,2011
Robert Randolph,"From the Chitlin' Circuit to the Peppermint Lounge
Been run off more than once for goin' underground
Where I met an old bluesman with a walking cane
He wore a stripe suit and used someone else's name

He said son I've seen it all
And it's not what you think
He said there's some tough choices to be made
Then he took a little drink
And I heard him say

I do not play no rock and roll
Would not be moved to sell my soul
The demons are out tonight
Rock you sinners
The demons are out tonight
Roll you sinners
Straight down the line

I passed an old church on my way back East
Heard a gospel choir singing of war and peace
I was deeply moved so I stepped inside
I just stood in the back where I could easily hide

A woman in a black robe stood up
And pointed me out
She said Hallelu Hallelu
Oh then she began to shout
And I heard her say

I do not play no rock and roll
I would not be moved to sell my soul
The demons are out tonight
Rock you sinners
Oh the demons are out tonight
Roll you sinners
Straight down the line

Now he could croon a tune as good as anyone
And if he sings a song then that song's been sung
Some things have tradition, some shine like new
Some things you can't change no matter what you do

He said my friend I've done it all
Either for love or money
And if I laugh at your jokes
Oh that means his jokes are funny
And one more thing

I do not play no rock and roll
I would not be moved to sell my soul
The demons are out tonight
Rock you sinners
The demons are out tonight

Lonely without my impediments
Start to save what we used to steal

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Hoping there'll be no break of day
Prison warden do I get that pardon
I'm  betting my life for a stay
I see through your bars the hangman and his guards
The preacher man all coming my way

Began making eyes at me
Round sexy hips silky hair and ruby lips
And she was wild and she was bad
All in a flash I was in a clash
Another man died by my hand

Hey bitty ya ya hey bitty ya ya day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Robert Sanov,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.
Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.

Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

On won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinating Rhythm,2001

I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)

Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,

Robert Sanov,"I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky",I Remember Sarah,2001
Robert Sanov,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Robert Sanov,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2001

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.

Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Robert Sanov,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late

Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon",Speak Low,2001
Robert Schilling,"Keep it on the side, little girl in white
Keep it as the portrait of your pain
Keep it on the inside, a silhouette of time
Keep it in the framework of your day

Free as a fly, the bird in the sky
The basket of everlasting life
Locked in the mouth, dead by the docks
Going nowhere fast today

Chase the dream, running down the street
Chase tomorrow's hope for peace
Chase your needs, fragile leaves
Chase nothing â??till its seen
It's black and white, it hides, free

Keep it in your heart, never change the hunt
Keep it in your faith, never chase the blame
Keep it in your soul, never lose your cool
Keep it in your name, and from those afraid to chase....Dreams

Back in the saddle, the city kettle
Sweat pours out from the veins
But before I leave you, a gray old man
The chase is the common thread of man",Heartbreak Girl Estranger,2000
Robert Schimmel,"Remember when there was nothing else to do, 
But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back 
To bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.",Heart Attack,1999

That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.
Once upon a night,
I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.

Once upon a time
Once upon a wish

""Do an insult track, we need it for radio play""
Cram in the names, I'll take a long hard pee
Time to mess up the biz like an MP3

American Idols, that's who I look for
In the poop section of my local record store
Ruben or Clay, oh, which should I pick
It's like choosing which puddle of vomit to lick

And when I want something even more fruity and fake
I look up 'N' for N' Sync or 'T' for Timberlake
So many skills Justin's making a buck at
Does he rap? Does he sing? He doesn't know what to suck at

Now as for the bitches, let's give Britney thanks
For the face that launched a million pre-teen skanks
You were a virgin, that had to be hard
You've had more bones in your mouth than a St. Bernard

Still I'd hump you if I could wear my flea collar
You're looser than my poop after eating Honeydew
Only 50 Cent's been plugged more than you

And yet you're too old for Fred Durst to desire
He's checking out the cast of ""Lizzie McGuire""
Soon Fred will try to get Mandy Moore
To open for him and I don't mean on tour

You're not the first, Durst, poor R Kelly
His videos premiere at the LAPD
I believe they set up an innocent guy
You know what else? I believe I can fly

I believe Michael too, yes

Now look how friggin' cool those guys from the Strokes are
Their riffs are three times as old as my jokes are
Hey White Stripes guy, is that your wife or your sister
Shouldn't you be playing country music, Mister?

Hey Coldplay, maybe you should be Coldsore
Back when you were U2 I liked you so much more
Somehow your song ""Yellow"" reminds me of pee
I think, 'cause when it's over, it's a big relief to me

Now Pink, is that your hair or a tattoo?
I didn't know Supercuts had a drive-through
Yo Nelly, what the hell kind of name is that?
That's about as gangsta as an easter bonnet hat

And Snoop says he's clean now? You make the call
The guy's higher than Billy Joel's cholesterol
Snoop, there's only room for one dog, putz
And I can rap, can you lick your own nuts?

Poop Diddy are you in show business still?
I didn't know wearing a suit was a skill
J Lo, J Lo, the giant tail-o
For a doggy's nose, that's the Holy Grail-o

Shakira's butt's fine but it won't hold still you see
I sniffed Elton John's tush just for all the history
I sniffed J-Lo's ass and got too touchy-feely
She let loose a bomb that was bigger than chili

I keed, I keed

I even like, I don't like Affleck

Avril Lavigne punk queen, now there's a kidder
Go back north, Celine needs a babysitter
Philip Glass, atonal ass, you're not immune
Write a song with a fucking tune

And on the list of pussies, don't leave off MTV
I scared them and Eminem so they gave the hook to me
Slim Shady, why do you find me so scary?
We're just two regular dudes who banged Mariah Cary

Wipe off that frown, just do without it
Hey my mom was a bitch too
But I don't go writing songs about it

I keed, I keed
(He just make a little joke)
I joke with you
(Little dog, little joke)

I keed, I keed

You know I never meant to hurt you
(Never meant to make you cry)

I keed, I keed

It's a joke you see
(Laffy, laffy, laffy, ha, ha)

Let's stop hating each other

Leave the pooping to me

Rock it to me, sock it to me
Rock it to me, sock it to me

Turn the corner, rub my eyes and hope the world will last

Robert Stewart,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Robert Stewart,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Robert Stewart,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1998
Robert Stewart,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1998

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

Can make you see and feel

And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
Got me hypnotized
And I know that's right

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most is the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Got me hypnotized",Hypnotized,2003
Robert Valdes,"This affair is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainly
Tell me now I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or to go

Love me or leave me 
Or let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with someone else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give it back tomorrow
For your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,2003
Robert Valentino,"Un jour le Bon Dieu
Le front soucieux
Se dit mon vieux
Ton grand ciel bleu
N'a rien de rose
Plus j'y réfléchis
Plus je me dis
Qu'il manque ici
Un paradis
Ou autre chose
Il fit tant et bien
Avec ses mains
Et presque rien
En un peu moins
D'un semaine
Qu'il avait créé
Les champs, les prés
L'hiver, l'été
Et aussi les
Formes humaines
Il les convoqua
Leur dit ""voilà
Avec tout ça
Vous n'avez qu'à
Vivre tranquilles
Je vous en fais don
Tout y est bon
Mais attention
D'être dociles
Et de me faire la promesse
De ne pas toucher
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier""
Le bon Dieu parti
Adam se dit
Ben mon ami
T'es mieux ici
Que dans une usine
T'as une poupée
Une beauté
Qui est roulée
Comme pour tourner
À la Goldwine
Et ce brave Adam
Passait le temps
En souriant
Béatement
Comme bien des hommes
Sans avoir idée
Que sa moitié
Puisse flirter
Avec un r'présentant en pomme
Eve trouvait charmant
Et affolant
Ce beau Tarzan
Nommé Serpent
Dit à sornettes
Qui sut l'envoûter
La fasciner
Lui fair' croquer dans la pomme
Et perdre la tête
Au point d'oublier sa promesse
De ne pas toucher au pommier
Non, de ne pas toucher au pommier
Non, de ne pas toucher au pommier
Tout commence ici
Eve en folie
Pris un beau fruit
Et le tendit
A son p'tit homme
Et le brave Adam
Toujours confiant
À belles dents
Mordit dedans
Comme une pomme
Lorsque Dieu l'apprit
Avec mépris
Il leur a dit
Plus d'paradis
Non, je vous condamne
À vivre et lutter
À travailler
Hiver, été
Et tout ça c'est
À cause d'une femme
C'est ainsi depuis
Que la vie
Même aujourd'hui
L'homme est trahi
Dans l'ignorance
Et le vieux pommier
Presque oublié
Est remplacé
Par le péché
De complaisance
Car les femmes tiennent leur promesse
De ne pas toucher au pommier
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier
Car, elles préfèrent goûter au péché
C'est si doux, c'est si doux
De goûter au péché
Ah! C'est doux, de goûter au péché
De goûter au péché",À Propos De Pommier,2017
Robert Valentino,"Il y avait, il y avait
Un monsieur très entouré
Un monsieur très admiré
Un monsieur très à la page
Qui vivait dans un village
De son métier chef de gare
Et de plus roi du billard
Le champion de la contrée
Et que nul n'osait contrer
Dans le village on disait plein d'égards... gare

Monsieur Jonas
Est un as
Au billard
Faut voir
Comme il joue
Car ses coups
Sont fumants
Époustouflants
Matin et soir

Sur le comptoir
Y'a son verre
De bière
Les gens se pressent
Et acquiescent
Ses coulées
Ses coups doublés
Au coin de la bouche un mégot presqu'éteint
On croit qu'il louche pourtant il n'en est rien
Il sait très bien calculer ses effets
Il sait ce qu'il fait
Il ne se presse pas
S'énerve pas
Mais il prend
Son temps
Son jeu est sûr
Sa figure
A le sourire
Ce qui fait dire
Monsieur Jonas
Est un as
Au billard
A le voir
Les gens tout haut
Crient bravo
C'est un as
Monsieur Jonas

Il y a eu, il y a eu
Un monsieur qu'est arrivé
Un monsieur étranger
Un monsieur très à la page
Qui venait d'un autre village
Contre Jonas il joua
Et Jonas perdit cette fois
Mais ne pouvant le supporter
Un soir il s'est suicidé
Et dans le village on ne joue plus au billard... car

Le diable passe
C'est Jonas
Qui revient
Malin
Il frappe les joueurs
Qui de peur
S'évanouissent
Font une jaunisse
Il boit la bière
Casse des verres
Mange les bleus
Parbleu
Sans crier gare
Dans le billard
Tout de go
Fait des accrocs
Au lointain on entend gémir les trains
Les trains fantômes qui courent dans le matin
Sur son passage le vent balaye tout
Et crie comme un fou
Jonas, Jonas
Les villageois
Perdent la joie
Et le sommeil
Et dans leurs oreilles
Vite ils enfilent
Du coton hydrophile
Pour ne plus écouter
Un Jonas déchaîné
Qui se met à hurler
Monsieur Jonas
Est un as
Au billard",Monsieur Jonas,
Robert Valentino,"Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.
Plus blond que tes cheveux dorés
Ne peut s'imaginer,
Même le blond des blés.
Plus pur que ton souffle si doux,
Le vent, même au mois d'août,
Ne peut être plus doux.
Plus fort que mon amour pour toi,
La mer, même en furie,
Ne s'en approche pas.
Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.

Si un jour tu devais t'en aller
Et me quitter,
Mon destin changerait tout-à-coup
Do tout au tout.

Plus gris que le gris de ma vie,
Rien ne serait plus gris,
Pas même un ciel de pluie.
Plus noir que le noir de mon c?ur,
La terre en profondeur
N'aurait pas sa noirceur.
Plus vide que mes jours sans toi,
Aucun gouffre sans fond
Ne s'en approchera.
Plus long que mon chagrin d'amour,
Même l'éternité
Près de lui serait court.
Plus gris que le gris de ma vie,
Rien ne serait plus gris,
Pas même un ciel de pluie.

On a tort de penser, je sais bien,
Aux lendemains.
A quoi bon se compliquer la vie
Puisqu'aujourd'hui...

Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.
Plus blond que tes cheveux dorés
Ne peut s'imaginer,
Même le blond des blés.
Plus pur que ton souffle si doux,
Le vent, même au mois d'août,
Ne peut être plus doux.
Plus fort que mon amour pour toi
La mer, même en furie,
Ne s'en approche pas.
Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois que les rêves
Que m'apportent tes yeux...

Robert Valentino,"Quand elle chante, quand elle chante 
Les anges se taisent pour écouter sa voix 
Quand elle danse, quand elle danse 
Les amoureux voudraient la tenir dans leurs bras 
Quand elle rit, un vent léger vient emporter 
L'éclat de rire qu'elle daigné laisser tomber 
Et quand je l'aime, oui quand je l'aime croyez-moi

Ah oui! c'est vraiment la plus belle 
Celle dont je suis amoureux 
Elle n'a pas de sœur jumelle

En elle tout n'est qu'harmonie 
On ne peut rien lui reprocher

Robert Van Den Berge,"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock",Jingle Bell Rock,2013
