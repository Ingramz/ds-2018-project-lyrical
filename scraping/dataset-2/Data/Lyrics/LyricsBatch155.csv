DJ Jazzy Jeff,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway!
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street!
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, ''cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin' , cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, ""Yo, that was def!""
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street!
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, Yo! This heat is the worst!
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone, but the TV was on.
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and I then almost choked
When I heard this aweful voice comin' from behind, it said
""You are my favorite rapper, but now you must die!"" (?)
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, ""So long ''cause!""
Got halfway up the block, I calmed down and stopped screamin'
And thought, Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I'm thinkin' since this is a dream, I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the big, bad, Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said,
""Here's what we'll do. We've got a lotta work here, me and you,
The souls of your friends, you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brains.""
I said, ""Yo, Fred. I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't parnters with nobody with nails that long.
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be yours, Fred, your face is all burnt""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep.
But gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I pat him on the shoulder, say, ""Thanks for stoppin' by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care, guy!""
He got mad, threw back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, Hold up...that hurt.
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, uh, there's been an aweful mistake here.""
No further words, and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said,
""Oh please, do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed and threw the covers with his claws
Tried to get me...but my alarm went off. and then
Silence
It was a whole new day, I thought.
Heh...I wasn't scared of him, anyway.
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street.
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
See'mon, see'mon...
See'mon Jeff, answer!
See'mon man
Jeff: Hello...
Prince: Jeff, it's Prince man, Jeff, wake up Jeff, wake up!
Jeff: What do you want?!
Prince: Jeff, wake up, man. Listen to me. Jeff
Jeff: It's 3 O'clock in the morning, what do you want?
Prince: Jeff, listen, Jeff, would you listen to me? Whatever you do, don't
Fall asleep.
Jeff: Man!
Prince: Jeff..listen to me. Don't go to sleep
Jeff: Look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm goin' to bed
AGHH.....AGHHH
Prince: Jeff! Jeff! ..........Jeff, answer me, Jeff!
Freddy: I'm your D.J. now, Princy...HA HA HA",A Nightmare on My Street,2002

Brooklyn, New York to wherever you at
This is autobiographical taking you back
I live a charmed life
We going back in the years
Imagining if my whole world what
Where you coming from
Brooklyn, New York to wherever you at
This is autobiographical taking you back
I live a charmed life
We going back in the years
Imagine if my whole world

I been around the sun twenty-five times
And I still find new ways to recognize shine
It's like light gets better with age
The way a song sounds better on stage

And rhyme books get better with each page
What before the first bar was written
A first verse was spittin
Before label execs was bullshittin

Way back when Aunty Leann Aunt Mimi and Aunt Jackie was babysitting
Before food was bitten, consumed through a nipple
I'm talking about when times were simple
To make a long story short it goes

Port-au-Prince Knoxville Anvan love and the city that never sleeps
From thought to finish I was born just a couple of weeks late
Stayed home longer just to make sure everything was on straight
All systems go cut the umbilical cord

From old earth to new earth Manhattan to turf
For what its worth my mum held me down one deep
Pops was absentee but minds you don't sleep
It took her feelings to raise me lean taught me how to read

By the time I went to school I was in high speed
Ready willing and able jackie taught me how to add with
Dried up black eyed peas on the kitchen table
And coming home to a mothers love and good care

Never wanted it was always enough
But when it came to education its like she had one rule 
There's no such thing as too much school
Not to mention lean taught me how to play the piano and then

Every summer I was out in south ben
Grandpops a bartender at a country club
Me and my cousins from grand rapid was living it up
Me and granny watching ??? football golden blue

She said you can't beat the team and them be	's too
Some say I got my sense of humour from her
And I learned patience from making models in the basement
Brookyn, new york to wherever you at

This is autobiographical taking you back
With no time for refrains I barely got enough time to explain
How hip hop captivated my brain
My mama raised me on soul and beethoven

Sports clubs from private school put me up on soft rock
That was cool but I left Z100 and WGLJ
To find bliss with real s and kiss
Video music rocks showed my what time it is

Wrote my first rhymes as corey but j-live was sparked
Making pause mix demos with my main man mark
Playing ball in the park, there was other heads too
I was the herb of the crew, then I learned what to do

Got my way from school started battling fools
G nice my friendly rival at the lunch table
He started spark at a dark with damian and I date
I was down for a bit but that was just a DJ

Starting spinning in the PJs with satcho and them
Back and forth from the tables to the pad and the pen
Then I had to do a bit upstate but wait
I wasn't incarcerated but college educated

As soon the Albany I was a full time student part time emcee
At the time raw shack was the place to be
Living on judge Clark
Started building with gods

16 man squad
By the time knowledge was 120 we was just 5 deep
I went from Mecca to Albany a student and landed in medina as a teacher
I had this rhyme reacher

We recognized what what's happening
I'm making records and I'm winning
But that's another story and it's only the beginning

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"I got love for the game that's why I'm rhyming always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest give power to songs
Girl ripping when I'm home about the hours I'm gone
I can't help it the studio where Paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains
You got love for the game

(Yo I'm feeling you yams do the same thing yo)

For the love of the game
Only deal in dollars and change
Switch places for big faces one and the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the booth till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Keep the tools in the shed
Got a place to lay
But a place to stay
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan shark spaghetti no meat balls
At least y'all can eat y'all can feel my pain
When a cloudy day feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin of that day who this chrome gonna kill
Smiling women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming g's from Jeff
Pockets on my cheese on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ass cat see sack song writer worldwide doom ball rider
Feel my blood and tears but the love for the drug got me loved and revered
From these thugs for years
It's the game yo

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap

Yo black it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game
(Uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name
Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you making
Damn see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat Jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dress room back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on whack
Just wanna back y'all nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with black
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Take time to make time
For all things work out so perfectly

There is a place I often
Close my eyes and drift off to
Where time stands still and it feels
As if I'm floating on a cloud now

In this place there are no burdens
Of the world to trouble me no
I become one with the rhythm
Caught by the spirit in love
With the beat, yeah, yeah

I start dancing to the rhythm of my own drum
Sweating away all my urban blues
And in that instant moment
The fast things of the rat race are left behind
And right now it could be sweeter I'm just passing time

I know that you might not want to wait
But don't give up, no

Find the energy inside to stand up
(Cause you can't hide)

Adversity over come your fears with faith
And you will see you can stand up
On your own two feet

A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes

Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even

How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up

That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"[Verse 1]
I've seen streets we're youth are forced to take the long way home
And I've seen mothers mourn the loss of there only born
Still I believe we are given nothin more than we can beg
A vision is only blurred when life seems unfair

Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When he's just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fast paced pipe dreams and shortcomings
He's just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing

Its like we damned if we do and damned if we don't
And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke

[Chorus]
And being one red button away from world war three
Always called the minority
And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail

[Verse 2]
Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle

One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

[Chorus]

One button away from world war III
Being called a minority
And being pulled always being pulled over and subject to brutality
Why is every street like a living hell
Probably cause they all just want us to fail
And three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slaves ship when they sail but they don't know that

My people whose pains are cornered
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more peoples more sistas and brothas
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell

You need to listen

[Verse 1]
Rockin is a state of mind for niggaz who really do it
Leavin suckaz behind and can't move through it
You cut a throat to do better than niggaz doing better
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
you MP knucks rappers get swung like trucks
Niggaz swearing that he nice when he really suck
And yo ruck why do rappers say they thugs and gangstas
When they halloween dress up nigga panty hose
Acting like he hard with them new edition candy girl flow
I'm funky like george sir knows
I'm real like tax time you try to escape
I clamp down on your real estate and your fake estate
That means everything rented borrowed stolen
And anything you might be holdin
I Come like ?? it us
Under pressure buss it
Philly soul reaching
Bumpy heart touching
Jazzy like jeff nigga I'm not a giraffe

And be dead centre chest like the gold medallion
That hangs around a neck on a old italian

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (that's right its bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs

I'll write your eulogy you bother me(that's right)
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now

[Verse 2]
Here I am the real emcee
Writing off sucka emcees like I'm dmc
Little killers in the bm 3
Follow one be in the black 600 with the one true v
I'm in V12 but wherever I dwell
They bust for me in heaven they bust for me from hell
Cause I'm still hot any rapper I fear not
I give it to you raw like my pops was gil scott
Mama was jill scott
Humming melodies
My head on her chest feeling the bass in her breast
Time nor space exists for the man
That knows the eternal
Don't make me return you
You can pull it out
Wave it no doubt
But before you bust it off

Come to bumpy get your heart tested
If you pass you'll be passing out
I'm blasting in and I'm blasting out

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother me (that's right)

[Verse 3]
I'm more convinced now than on a part on my life
That I'm a die with rhyming kids and a rhyming wife
I'm a body every nigga that ever did me trife
That's word to great grand grandma indian and her carving knife
I'm power in its finest hour ask queen latifah
Whose the hardest rap gansgta that she'll ever speak ta
You better check my record
Matter fact check my album industry shook down
Niggaz is shook down
Its time for revolution
Cause I see booty its wax prostitution
'I'm the chairmen of busting niggaz with chairs
Cracking niggaz heads open with heineken beers
Most people see my shadow black and wide
But can't see my heart black with pride
Cause you got a devil inside
Plotting for the spot where the late great biggie reside
I be a father like big chuck
Raising my son and keep the enemy close
And bust their gun
I step to a few niggaz and made em all one
With a 16 shot beretta that I call fun
Music must reflect the time time reflect the music
The shorty come correct if you next to use it
From lil bow wow to lil zane
I told lista kane brother little daddy shane
I always spit a nigga name
And hope to god he answer then I get all in his body
Like a nasty cancer
I take honour and take pride in the mic and I fight for it
Like it was a civil rights baby

[Chorus 2x]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know why'all niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (not baby)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

Scram kid your new to me you bother
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"Yo, just feeling the way that I do
Hope lives on, if not through me through song
I'm getting the long, take deep breaths and hold on
I write like I realize I could be gone

I'm here, is the true meaning of love clear?
If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?

Some think men don't cry, well, here's tears
Been told all these lives for these years
It's unclear why truth is untold
But hold fast and truth will unfold

I know but it's kinda hard to believe
That a whole generation will die over greed
And that most of our young will die overseas
But it all remains to go unseen

We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe

We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children

Keep your head to the sky
The only way that you fail is if you never ever try
Where I come from, I'm there for you, care for you
You don't have to worry I'm gonna always be there for you

Doing what, laying the foundation 'cause we gonna make it
But it's gonna take dedication
And what and hope and love and peace
I hope one day you'll see and then you can join us

Listen if you love me say the words to me
I'm surrounded by so many things that hurt to me
You know you'll always come first to me
This is music, it ain't nothing but a verse to me

Remember after the pain there's sunshine
It's not in vain we all feel it sometimes
Stay strong, hold on, we gonna make good

For all the ghettos way to dammit
Hey, the world, don't you panic
Let courage lead you right

Darkness is temporary
Even though the future's looking scary, yeah it is
The most I don't make mistakes
When your chosen us the light

I know we're a long way from home
On this land that they stole, took it all
Gave us drugs after gold
Incarceration to a fold

To raise the murder toll
What else, to divide communities
Do away with unity
Where the strength is human beings

On the corner out shootin' the dice
Layin' up, gettin' nice, talkin' bout a heist
G-Q headin' up to one-two-five
Push up on a shorty lookin' live on the prize
I couldn't get the time of day when I was Little K
Now you call me Buck so your lips want to puck?
Fuck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts
But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts
Word to the shell around my chest

Let me freak the funk,
Obsolete is the punk that talk more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate that complice their mental state
As I invade their masquerade
They couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted
For an easy out, I leave mc's with doubt
Of exceeding, my name is Bottie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading,
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E.
They have no key, or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Standing looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talking about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

All missions impossible are possible, cause I'm
Heading for a new sector 365 days from now, I'll
Wipe the sweat from my brow
And each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chics, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance

Deep in broken mansville, trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health

Missiles, to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me, and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow, the truth because it hurts

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"""It's another one of them old phunky Cypress Hill things, you know what I'm
sayin'?And it goes like this""

Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah
Of the funky Buddha
Eluder
Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals

[Chorus: x2]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', Coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gat ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gat you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, ""Yo, it's on!""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

[Chorus: x2]

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite
My spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No!I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming coming at ya
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say ""fuck it!""

[Chorus: x2]

Here is something you can't understand

""All I wanted was a Pepsi!""

""What does it all mean?""",How I Could Just Kill a Man,2004

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)

I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

Shit sounds like some old wild western
Shoot em up, O.K. Corral
Blowin up spots, Missin Linx
Better run that

Prepare your eardrums
For one of the ruggedest raw MC's
To ever bless the mic device, Rhymes Galore like Busta
You musta been sniffin that shit
To think that you could fuck wit me or any of the members of my click
For that matter, wit ya chitter-chatter
Makin your body parts splatter
Send you an e-mail bomb and erase your data
Now you're clueless, wonderin how I do this
Simple and plain, I run wit real niggas and squads that carry Rugers

[Al Tariq]
Aiyyo I shit you and noyds and spit that shit called noise
Got your boys losin poise, kickin Stories like some Toys
Wit the kung-fu grip, don't trip
Watch the crack or break your mother's fuckin back
Flip script and watch me act like a legend
Got you pledgin your allegiance
To the three men, potent 'cause we semen
Let me control all sons, leak shit, we come wit tons
You could never see these ones, just our mothafuckin guns

[Black Attack]
Oh ya'll niggas talk the slim shit
Don't make me have to rewind this back
Black Attack got the Feds lookin for dimes and crack
None of that though, we been unloaded, fuckin blowin
I exploded, fuck is ya'll smokin, sounded corroded
Ya'll know my status, fuck wit dime pieces
Twist Godfather's full of berries 'fore I bless the aparatus
Who the baddest or the realest, niggas feel this cross seas
While you shinin wit diamonds I'm flossin wit trees

[Problemz]
Ya'll niggas'll never manifest the lyrical text that I posses
Burn your chest hairs like Jack Daniels when I dismantle
Your whole persona, that's my word to marijuana
Blaze a nigga like gonga, don't make me have to remind ya
The shit I drop on you, about 29 bars ago
Prob's the pro, flowin without question, recollectin
On shit I did in the past, blaze and get Cash like Johnny
Need me? In the back wit the fat sack of chronic

Chorus 2x

Aiyyo A-L-T-A-Riq freak incredible
Regurgitate these raps, too much fat, never edible
But legible, read my lips son (Fuck you)
Comin through, blunts and brews, Q-you wit mobs and crews
Now who you? 'cause I don't hear no noise from your cypher
Fuck around wit this and get twist, we be some lifers
For takin yours, breakin yours yo I'm started
Now check the middle finger for foes dearly departed

[Black Attack]
Now you know I can flow though
Wit no dough, flip promos in slow mo
Light the dro though
Fuckin wit Black Attack, now that's a no-no
Nuff the bullshit, niggas better stop comin partial
Ya'll want to play captain, Sean Black'll play the marshall
The biggest, largest, Ac coupe kamikaze
Hoppin out the Expedition, twist diggy off the gongy

You be a jack of all trades and a master of none
Mood Swinging

La la la la la... eh oooo oo X4

Soon come you will understand
The motivation of a man getting the under hand
A local yokel on a mission to get global
Lettin' my vocals amass to some total
And keep the point focal, you hear me but you don't listen
You think its easy being put in this position
I freak speech, but still don't want to preach
This peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees
Grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn
The activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment
So I leading a community movement
And I don't need money for me to make a community improvement
Tell me what you stand for
Would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more
Only time will tell, what this new world brings
Revolutions at order, check the mood swing, swing
Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

Low like sweet chariot
What I say make my voice deep as berries get
Carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry 'em off
Have a divorce if the track is whack
(Please) My rhymes a rolling stone
Home is where the high hatters at, its on this song
(it on this song) Maybe one day it'll settle down
It ain't no good it all better now, come on let it now

Mood swinging, swinging, mood swing, swinging, ooo oo

Me and baby in the rental
She talkin' gentle hit the hotel to presidential
Sweet...kisses on the temple make her feel special
Light a candle scent got us in this sentimental
Move it's right wit the light just so I could see
Begin to set the pace for what we gon' get into
My fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental...
Ancient secrets, Indian, and Oriental
Blackin' out doin' shit that I can't rap about
Passin' out, wakin' up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not stop
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin' late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
But damn baby ""You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine""

Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
The great pretender wit a whole different agenda
Until I make it big ""Life is one long gig""
Mood swing like Ella of cold train its classic
Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
So all of why'all that wagging they campaign
Grab a hold of that mood swing and do the damn thing

I'm an outlet
A front of which which you ain't figured out yet
A resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course
It seats ya, doin' whatever it takes ta reach ya
All of its in me, no really its in me
A good brother, lovin' son, a great lover
I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an emcee for all of the world to see
Yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
That we rep shit, its the least to be expected
Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
From the same minds saying the same things at the same time
Back stage rappin' like gettin' ready for game time
We a family, and ain't nothing goin' to change that
For better or worse like somebody prearrange that
The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
That's when our nation will rise and realize that 

Life without knowledge is death in disguise

The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

See change is good sometimes

It's time to mood swing

Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
Or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
But turned bitch and knowin' damn well they lack
In this division the connoisseur, crackin' your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin' like Noah
Always sendin' you down, perpetratin' facadin' what you consider
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too

Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin' it?  Why you lyin' for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'

'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"Listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know

But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine
I said my name is the Prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy

But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine

I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street

She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape

I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death

I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo Clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away
I was in a bar one Friday night

Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on Tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is Sheila
I responded by saying hello

She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses

She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing

Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move

I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin

And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm

And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing

I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play

Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away
Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example

Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run DMC concert

(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(yeah)
Aight fine see you then Betty

I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ????
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mon said Betty's not ready yet

I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair

At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home

But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes

Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme

The way that people respond to summer madness

And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan stting on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at

The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wiping your car down
It's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show

Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't spead through

My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there

Now I'm seeing the pay off of all my hard work

Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
For those in the past who dissed me don't deny it

I used to know this girl by the name of Teresa
I did all I could to make her release her
Emotions to me but she just wouldn't do it
She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it
I used to walk to school everyday of the week
Watching Teresa walk on the other side of the street
One day I finally got my heart up to speak
She dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
So I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne
But all I got from Teresa was
(leave me alone)
Bought new clothes to wear every place
But all Teresa would say was
(get out of my face)
So I gave up this quest for Teresa
But then on the day my record was released
A strange thing happened when it came on the radio
Teresa broke her neck just to say (hello)
I looked at her I said you must be foolish
Why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said
(oh I apologize)
I looked deep into her dark brown eyes
I said you ignored me for months on end
Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend
You didn't talk before so don't talk now what be quiet
What you really like me? Don't even try it

Man she had a lot of nerve man (word)
But man she ain't have half as much nerve as that record producer
The one that dissed us man
What up

When I first started rapping I had one idea
And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist
I'll give my all and work my hardest
But when I took my song to a record producer
He told me that I better go drink some rap juice or
Something because my song was really absurd
He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
Yo my ego was shattered he busted my groove
I could hear him cracking up as I left the room
I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
The title was girls ain't nuthin' but trouble
Hopefully I found someone who had faith
He lifted my ego back up into place
His name was Dana Goodman (chill) he thought the song was on track
So two weeks later it was out on wax
It busted up the charts like a hydrogen bomb
Up up up it climbed climbed climbed
People eat their words that said I couldn't achieve
Now they have no choice bit to believe in me
Then no sooner than my record came out
That same old producer started calling my house
One night he called me about half past 12
I've got some cash if you wanna sell
I said you big stupid half wit idiot
I told you before that my record was a hit
I just laughed like some kind of kid
Now don't you regret what you did
I wish you'd get off my tip now that's my request
See he who laughs last always laughs best
Okay I'll be reasonable you wanna buy it
Okay I'll sell it psyche don't even try it

You know what I'll tell you sumthin'
I got this so hard man
I'm a tell you sumthin'

Yo Prince you remember when we first started out
How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house
Word man I remember those good days well
Well chill out man cause I got a story to tell
About five years ago I began my quest to be the best DJ in the whole US
There was a lot of DJ's striving in my spot
They were putting me down every chance I got
Never cut me a break on any given night
They used to all look at me and say
(Jeff's alright)
But when your magnificent cuts were released
All of that left has ceased (word)
When you and I used to do our shows
All the crowd would say is Ho
Yeah time after time we were tearin' it up
While you rock the mic and I rocked the cut
But now that I'm making a name for myself
All those DJ's are like
Yo Jeff whats up
All that stuff is dead nope I ain't with it
They'll push me on the street and say
(yo Jeff how bout a ticket man)
To your very next show
But I say no
And I tell them where they can go
I cant believe that they have the nerve
To hop on my tip now
Yeah man word
Just the other day homeboy approached me on the street and said
""yo Jeff how bout a record for free""
Man the way you dissed me you better go buy it
But man we're friends for real don't even try it

Man straight up you know how it is
Word
Maybe they'll know not to diss next time
We let em know
Cause I ain't with it
Aight Jeff chill",Don't Even Try It,1987
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Have you ever in your life experienced a day 
Where nothing at all seems to go your way 
No matter how hard you try to get out of the rut 
You just could not break the string of bad luck 
A day where Murphy's law takes over your life 
And you just can't seem to do a darn thing right 
And when the day was over you just had to say 
You said man it's just one of those days 

My day started off kind of cool 
I brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school 
I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack 
A tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack 
About that point I proceeded to class 
I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed 
I went to my room which was on the first floor 
I had no idea what I was in for 
I sat in my desk and minded my own business 
Someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it 
This girl walked in my imagination ran wild 
She stole my heart just by the way that she smiled 
I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt 
She said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut 
The teacher turned around while my arm was extended 
She looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended 
I said your tripping it's just a bad habit 
She put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it 
I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip 
Then I just shook my head I said I don't believe this 
She sent me to the head of the discipline staff 
I tried to play it off so I started to laugh 
I said ha ha this story is great 
It's a big misunderstanding one big mistake 
He didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile 
He said hm-hm-hm you're an unlucky child 
I stopped laughing and I said why is that 
He said just get out my school and don't you ever come back 
I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it 
He handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it 
As I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze 
And said man it's just one of those days 

I woke up around a quarter to eight 
I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great 
I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise 
I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine 
I hopped up and put my feet on the floor 
Ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door 
The pain was immense as it started to throb 
I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job 
So I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth 
Threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks 
Threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat 
Then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat 
I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys 
Then I prayed out loud car start please 
The car started but what good was that 
I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat 
I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block 
Then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock 
The bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous 
I got real mad because the sign said out of service 
I started hiking it I wasn't liking it 
I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it 
I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner 
There was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner 
Slammed on the flat I did 180 turn 
Peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn 
With the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk 
I thought man all of this 'cause I was trying to get to work 
I could've got away I almost had 'em shook 
'Til this girl walked by something said not to look 
But I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt 
But she made me miss the sign that said men at work 
I screamed out loud as I crashed through the barricade 
I saw my whole life flash before my face 
I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars 
I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars 
That was stupid I got off track 
'Cause about that point everything went black 
The next thing I remember is a head ache nagging 
I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon 
I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead 
A big Flintstones lump on the side of my head 
They took my picture and my finger prints 
I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince 
I demand that you release me you incompetent fool 
You can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules 
You got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights 
But then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche 
I had a call so I called my boss 
I figured I might as well what else could be lost 
Boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today 
He said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday 
Stuck in a cell scared as hell 
I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell 
Maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways 
But for now it's just one of those days 

It's just one of those days",Just One of Those Days,1987
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Each and every day when I come home from school
Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom
I secure the door and it's the moment of truth
I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble
A discotheque is what my room resembles
How loud it gets to me it does not matter
I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter
The blast falls off my neighbour's wall
My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls
But I just let it ring and I don't go near it
I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring
My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate
I'm in my own world and this realm is great
We rock this power at my command
The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand
The lower frequency better known as bass
Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace
My neighbours complain they say they can't endure
They form a congregation outside my front door
Mothers who yell saying its too loud
Start banging on my door to turn it down
My response to my mother when she starts knockin
Is come on mum I'm just rockin 
(rockin)
(ready rock c)
This style that's mine is rarely heard
Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe
People gots my rhyme the super computer
The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future
I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee
So hold the red cup when we take to your knees
Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme
Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
To all other rappers you're being subdued
I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude
This introductory performance has just one plot
A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks
I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk
Do yourself a favour and take a walk
Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core
I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord
My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and I'll strangle you
I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator
The crown chief of the poetry industry
Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy
highly respected by the public at large
The prince will rock is taking charge
I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible
You want a battle me man be sensible
I'll never submit to any other emcee
Be a duel to the death either him or me
And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut
If we kill a wack crew or two so what
We just rock it
We just rock it
DJ Jeff
Break 2
On each occasion that I perform
The force captures my body like a magical storm
Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock
But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock
Adrenalin rushes my ego swells
And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel
My metabolism quickens my body gets sense
That's when I metamorphosis into the royal fresh prince
And as I display all my lyrical beauty
You become a slave as your hype increases
And as I vocalize I can see it in your eyes
You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red
You scream oh my to what the prince just said
As my energy is drained from being so crushed
All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush
It happens each and every time that my dj spins
More commonly known as my second wind
The spotlights are beaming
You are screaming
From my body all the sweat is streaming
Commanding the stage
And perpetually frayed
Giving my all to the pulse of
One hundred percent everytime I rhyme
When I step off the stage that's when the stop
And that has been the account of the evenings events
Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince
I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin 
(what does it all mean)
I'm just rockin
Rockin rockin rockin
Go crazy

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense
You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent
Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot 
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top 
A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that 
If the rap that they're rapping is way off track?
I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cutting no slack 
To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps
In actuality, I mean in reality
The words that you use are a mere formality
Vocabulary is not what it's about
The point that you're trying to get across is what counts
Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words 
But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of
They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson
That it's not the words that count, it's the message 
They get a lot of big words out of some magazine
And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean
They stand up on the stage, huffing and puffin
Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin
Really but a lot of jibberish
And I know that they all wish
They had access to fresh rhymes like this
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top
Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz 
Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz
Good looks and charm and personality
You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me 
I know the same goes for the rest of my crew
My D.J Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too 
The ultimate combination of strength and prestige
My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need 
To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite
The time is right, so don't fight it Suckers, please don't bite it
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top
I really hate to brag about him
But when people doubt him I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him 
'United we stand, divided we fall'
Is the moto of our crew and it is honored by all of us,
We pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse 
And it enables us always to come out first
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
Yo, Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top? 
We succeed every time we attempt 
To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt 
From the rules set forth by us, of course you know 
Stay out our way or behold the brute force of Me Jeff and Ready Rock C,
We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? 
That means That there's three of us, one for all and all for one
And we're taking it to the top before we get done
I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find
It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine I insist on a rise and I despise a decline 
On the day I descend, that's the day I resign I'm creating my trends and innovatin my rap 
Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!
My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre
My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it
Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp 
Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have
Anything that you want, the sky is the limit 
Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it
Cause I came a long way from the past till today 
Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way! 
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot 
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top

She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
I said my name is the prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

I was in a bar one friday night
Cooling watching a mike tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example
Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

I got a ring on my phone may 5th last year
It was my girlfriend betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the run dmc concert
(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(yeah)
Aight fine see you then betty
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? 
Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show
Not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

Jazzy:
Man first your parents just don't understand
Then you having these crazy nightmares
Prince:
I know why me man why me
Jazzy: what's next
Prince: now these girls man you know how it is
Can't live wit 'em can't live wit'out 'em

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"As we go a little somethin like this, hit it

Now let's get this party, started off the right way
Ow and ho I think the crowd might say
When we're on stage you know you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)
I'm the ultimate, and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours a day
Tryin to figure out the proper description of me
And I came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
Okay I've got it all praise me
Yup that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it
But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly
But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, ladies please
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed on Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good, I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin Coolin, whassup
Girlies I'm with it, come pick me up
I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they all was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, Girls, you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

{*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*
""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}

Yo Jeff man, are you with me (Hit it)
I didn't hear you man, are you with me (Hit it)
I'm with it to get busy

(somethin like this, hit it)

Ready Rock see, give Jeff a hand!

(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

Throw away them jams cause you don't need em any more
Cause this hip-hop hit is gonna keep you on the floor
If you dance everyday or if you never danced before
It doesn't matter if it's (somethin like this)
Time is essential so let's make the best of it
Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, (somethin like this)
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene (hit it)
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One said to the other, I think that I've seen him somewhere before
I said sweetheart, you might have
She said oh yeah it was last night at that party
I said yeah I tried to talk to you there but you were acting as if you were scared
She said I'm not scared now I said Bet, well let's go then
She said but hold up, what about my friend
I said I got a friend
So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later, Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself yeah, now the fun begins
But the girls started buggin, and they said
Now we want dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight and Don Perignon I said yeah right
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said you know
I really think it's time for these ladies to go
We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed and it went a little (somethin like this)
But that was okay that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night ya know it
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
(so you all don't miss)

",As We Go,1988
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Fresh Prince] It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extraordinary,
So yo bust this commentary 
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty 
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk 

-Get down brand new funk-hit it

It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up 
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, 
""What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it""
He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?"" 
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was 
The {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it 
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it 
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it 
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club 
And out of my mouth I cold tore it up!
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin 
And clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on 
The microphone I was flowin 
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to 
Rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready 
Rock 
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the 
Brand new funk

The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling, 
Sensational, stupendous music
That has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated

Whassup y'all? Hello how are you doin out there?
You're chillin I'm winnin
Oh by the way the album's out go get it
We went to the studio and then we made a video
We didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so
Yo I got a message for my fans and friends
The last album was dope y'all and here we go again!

No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you
We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you
ten times harder than any other crew can
Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan
In other words, wherever we go
Hahah! We're runnin the show, but no
seriously, it's been a while since we dropped one
But it's out now, go buy the album
If you bought the last one you know it was krush
But if you didn't man, you must not
know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again!
A lot of people may not have bought the last album
Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them
to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end..
.. here we go again!

When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin, ""What's takin so long
for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?""
I said, ""Hold up - let me explain.
When you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!'
Sorry we gotta go
We got another show tomorrow night in Rio""
The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know
It takes a LONG TIME to travel the globe
But now we gotta start this whole process all over again
The last album was def, and here we go again!

Special thanks, to everyone that helped us
Without you, we would not have been able to sell
as many records, we went top ten
And got real and we'll do it again
It was a long hard road, believe me
People tryin to steal from me, and deceive me
But that's cool, you live and learn my friends
We did it before, and we'll do it agaim",Here We Go Again,1988
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Ever since I was younger, I was into video games
Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name
Thousands of my dollars, have been poured into all types of games, tryin to get the high score
But now I think I have a favourite
It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!
Oh no, I feel an attach coming on
Yo Ready Rock see I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong

It used to be a problem this addiction I have
I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad
Break into the arcade, screaming and hollering
Anticipating putting twenty-five dollars in any machine, I was out of control
I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls
Bags of quarters, I was insane
People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change
But I would get defensive and yell leave me alone
These are my quarters stupid, go get your own
Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like,
Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy
I was addicted, a video burn-out and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out
The lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say,
Have a heart pal, one more game please
Some nights I might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day
And when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again
I was doin bad my future was bleek
I'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day, this guy came along
He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song
I got curious, so I said, yo what's that noise?"" (What noise? I don't know)
No fool, that noise you was makin there (What this)
Yeah
That was def man, where'd you learn to do that
(Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that I had this talent deep down inside)
You wanna hear some more man Yeah (Come on let's take a ride)
He made sounds like I never heard before and he still had more
Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and I lost my mind when Ready see played Donkey Kong

Yo Ready, get funky with it!
Yo Jeff man what you doing? Give Ready a hand

Now my life is wonderful and I feel great
I haven't been in an arcade since seventy eight
Thanks to Ready see I'm on an upward trail
Because he's always by my side, he never fails me
Whenever I have a video attack
He's right there by my back keeping me on track
So if I bug out and act like a lunatic
He does Donkey Kong and as soon as it gets to my eardrums from his vocal chords
I get hyped up no matter how bored I am he always comes through
Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who
Ready Rock see, here's a brief description
Of the things that he can do in his musical position
Ready Rock see makes sounds with his mouth
Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talking about

(game over)
(Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there)
(The game is over haha sucker)




",Human Video Game,1988
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"I'd like to know, are you really for some super-dynamite sou
Introducing the world's greatest entertainer
The amazing Mr. Beat-Beat himself
The hardest working beatbox in show business
Ready Rock

(Ready, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C)
Tell em your name, tell em your name
(Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C)
Ooh that was nice Ready
(Ready Rock)
Ready Rock
Hey man, hold up man
I think I wanna tell em a little about this man
Aight break it down Ready, break it down

Please pay attention, to my rhymes so I can tell you all about this pal of mine
He's my buddy, my best friend
When it's a beat I need it's a beat he'll lend
I wanna take time-out, to talk about him
Cause frankly I don't know what I would do without him
We work together like a medical crew
When I'm backin Ready up (I'm backin Prince up too)
Tryin to beat us, that doesn't make any sense
He's Ready Rock see, and I'm the Fresh Prince
In the rap industry we're ranked at first
Ain't a better combination in the whole universe
So if you wanna battle your future looks muddy
That you just can't beat, my buddy

Word, break it down break it down Ready

We've won so many battles, people think it's a trick
That when the crowd gets to judge it's US that they'll pick
They see Ready's face and then they hear my voice
To choose us as the winners is the natural choice
Because battle after battle we remain on top
Cause it's not the way we look, it's the way that we rock
So if you thought you wanted to battle, bust this rhyme
Just keep it and I'm sure that I can change your mind
There was ten wack dudes trying to play high post
One crew got bold and they began to boast
But said, y'all shut up and get back in line
But they refused (what happened now) So now there's nine
Nine wack crews tryin to rock like this
They were bitin my rhymes and just couldn't resist
I said please stop bitin, please don't imitate
But they kept on bitin, so there's now there's eight
Eight wack crews poppin big time trash
Telling us that in a battle we can't last
The battle started at 10:30 and by quarter of eleven was no longer eight crews (how many was their)
There was seven
Seven wack cruise in a football huddle
Trying to figure out their next rebuttal
They came out strong you'd think their The Ultimate but we just dissed em and dismissed, so now there's six
Six wack groups, tryin to be tough
Who the hell told em they could rock the mic like us
We got straight down the business didn't pop no jive
We just blew em out, so now there's five
Five wack crews lined up in the hallway
All perpetrating like they're read to play
My secretary walked out, she asked for one more
They got scared, and left, so now there's four
Four wack crews outside playing around
I said I'll take you wall on, now how does that sound?
Not one had heart enough to pick up that mic
I said, okay I'll let you go, psych
That's the moral, of this story
Never try to take me and Ready Rock's glory
Cause if you do your future looks muddy
Cause you just can't beat me and my buddy

Haha word, uh
Yeah Ready Rock, hold up hold up hold up
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
What man what?
C'mon man, man, I wonder, can, can I just interrupt the record for a second?



",My Buddy,1988
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!

[Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Fresh Prince]
It was burnin in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin from behind
It said, "";You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!"";
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, "";So long, cuz!"";
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin
Then thought, "";Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin"";
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, "";Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain."";
I said, "";Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!"";
I patted him on the shoulder said, "";Thanks for stopping by."";
Then I opened up the door and said, "";Take care guy!"";
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, "";Hold up, that hurt!"";
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, "";Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here."";
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, "";Oh please do somethin with Fred!"";
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, "";Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway."";
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

In the place to be
DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly the Fresh Prince
Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a lil' TOUCH of the bass
Not a lot, just a lil' touch Jeff

Word word
Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up

Now bring it all back

Yo man now break it down and let me go for mine

When I first started out, Jeff used to come to my house
Just as soon as school let out, he used to
Come to my crib, and you know what we did?
We bugged out like two little kids, word
Jeff on the wheels, and me on the M.I.C.
A better combination there could never be
So let's go back, for old time's sake
Yo Jeff! (WHAT?) Pump up the bass!

I . like . my . music . loud!
The volume, pumpin, the kickdrum thumpin
The people jumpin, up out there seats
When this record comes on, you think something's wrong
The bass is too strong
You don't have to check your record, it's not defective
It's just the way we wanted it, pump it, get it?
We like it loud, strong like a magnum force
I am the lyricist, Jeff is the rhythm source
This combination, is virtually omnipotent
That means invincible, you know, dominant
So don't you cross our path, just stay out our face
Or we'll knock you down, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch

Now get funky with it

Now bring in the snare

Now break it down and bring it all back to me

Now pump up the bass!

I'm hyped - psyched up
And I'm flowin, so come on let's go in
To the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy
You say this can't be happening, why can't it be?
It's an equation, mathematically correct
It's Jeff + Prince, equals, hit records
Sounds too easy? Word, I know it does
You wanna know why? Well yo it's cause
Me and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me
Blend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi
That's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever
And if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever
Cause all we did to make this record a hit
Was turn down the treble, pump up the bass kit
At the same time the volume was increased
Adding more strength, to this masterpiece
Of poetry, by now you know it's me
Poet, creativity, pushin, to out destiny
I am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey
? keep us company, the human beat box Ready C
Backed up by a family, and that is all we need
So that we can be successful as we want to be
The future is in front of me so here is a taste
Of the future of hip-hop Jeff, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff one more scratch man

My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""
I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,
""Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

OK, here's the situation
""parents"" 68 lines, 2662 characters.
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""see 'mon toots, my name is the Prince
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open , the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak
I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it form me

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Aw man!
Put that ol' dumb horn down
Hey, Jazzy
Jazzy
Show this boy what some real music 'posed to sound like
He-he-ha!

( *drums and horns set in* )
1-2-3-4

( *Jazzy Jeff starts scratching* ) 
(Don't stop the rock)

Now that's a record!
Now that's a record!

Go Jazzy, go Jazzy, go

I want to be remembered for the songs that I sing
Not only for the humor, but for the knowledge I bring
To broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this
Enlightening minds with my lyrical tactics
In life everything ain't always what it seems
But people are enchanted by things that gleam
You know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions
On the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin
Now I'm about to tell you a very artistic fable
More fun than when you first got cable
The moral to be learned from this story to be told
Is that everything that glitters ain't always gold

On July 11th I was sittin at home
Talkin to my girlfriend Geena on the telephone
Flippin through the newspaper checkin the news
When I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise
It said, 'Sunny skies and romantic nights
On an incredible ship' - and I got hype
It said it's like the _Love Boat_, baskin in the sun
Promisin fun for you and for everyone
I said, "";That's dope! Baby, you're down?"";
She said, "";Yeah, we could leave right now!"";
The very next day I put the check in the mail
And one week later we were ready to sail
The brochure said that the boat was large
But it was nothin but a broken-down barnacle barge!
And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went
Because the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp
The cruise was paid for and the food was free
So I said what the hell and set out to sea
It didn't take long to notice something was wrong
The ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it
I didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while
Till the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle
We looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk
We saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts!
The said, "";Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-doa"";
I said, "";Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat"";
Their chief said they needed a human sacrifice
I said, "";Well, just take my girl - he-he - syke"";
I was jokin, but things got serious
Their leader came out and he was curious
He got in my face and his breath was the worst
I said, "";Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?"";
His breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth
And two big crusty ashy hairy feet
The worst thing, he had no toenail on his toes
And a big Teradactyl bird bone in his nose
I tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it
He said, "";Tenga-shanko,""; that meant 'forget it'
He said, "";Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo"";
That meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew'
Then I saw it - no, it's not
The big Indiana Jones people cooking pot!
I wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em
I thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?'
Just as they were contemplatin cookin us up
We had a major struck of luck, a Navy ship pulled up
The troops came off and they got us out of the pot
And I said to the chief, "";Yo, I get witcha, hops!"";
The guy that rescued us said, "";I hate to tell you
The captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Belview
We've been following him and finally we got him
We're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund"";
A thousand dollars and a weekend island drained
But a lesson well learned, so let me explain
There's a very important message that needs to be told
It's that everything that glitters ain't always gold

[The Fresh Prince:]
I was.. cruisin down the avenue, early one Friday
When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way
I turned my back to ?????????????
And I said, ""Hm-hm, excuse me,"" and she walked past
She was about 5'6"", or maybe six and a half
With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!
Tight leather pants that fit like a drum
And two big - yeah well, she had some
Anyway from behind she was fine
But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine
At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny
But the laughter ceased when she said: ""Hey honey!""
At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound
My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground
And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky
I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?!
I tried to get away, I said, ""Well, never mind
Maybe I'll see you some other time""
But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave
And said, ""Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!""
This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world
My whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl
And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain
They said, ""Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed""
My pride was busted right along with my eye
Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache

[The Fresh Prince:]
I remember last year, the day was October 5th
And my family went away on a weekend ski trip
And they left $100 and a note by the phone
That said: 'Don't have any company till we get home'
No company? I'm 18! They must be jokin!
And by 10 my crib was smokin
All of my friends with their hands in the air
Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!)
The party was jammin till at least about 5
And as my friends were leaving, they were like ""Homes, it was live!""
I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin
I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women
Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties
I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties
I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em
I said, ""Hi, my name's the Prince,"" they said, ""Hi Prince, we're your harem""
I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift
I said, ""Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with""
I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin
Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin
The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead
With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head
Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you
They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture
I said, ""Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?
What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?""
She turned around and smiled and laughed
And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache
Not four girls, four guys!
They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time
I made a complete fool of myself that day
My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away
They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost
There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post
My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question
""Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?""
Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived
I said, ""What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!""
""I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece
Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police""
I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever
My pop told me I was on punishment forever!
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache

Give me your attention, stop what you're doin and listen up
Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up
Jeff, is if someone said that your beats don't excite
And that your cuts were wack, what would you say? (Yeah, right!)
Jeff's about to give an incredible display
And unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay
His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparin to shake and make you move

And it'll (make em clap to this)
And it'll (make em clap to this)
(Come on, yeah)

You know, a lot of deejays, they're just short pieces of statues
My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you
To other deejays Jeff is just too much
He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch
Never missin beats, always on time with the rhyme
You know the scratches are fine when interwined with a bass line
Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex
You don't believe he's def? Check the flex

[ Jeff cuts up ]
(Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..)

I could talk forever, but still never explain
Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name
Jeff is number one, even though he just begun
Rulin hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun
We make records, it all adds up a caleidoscope
We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope
Some music makes you shake, some makes you move
(Now here's what I want y'all to do...)
This beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's Groove

There was a party the other day
Around my way
They asked if me and Jeff would play
We said okay
We nipped out to get the hip hop apparatus
Came back with the posse in full effect status
While Jeff set up, I said ""check one two y'all""
Everybody clap lets begin to ball
I was rapping a capella but I had to stop
Because chaos broke because Jeff waz on the beat box

Just cut it up Jeff
*hip-hop*
*chance to rock*
*Jeff waz on the beat box*

Did you know that parties were all the same when we came up
We had to rearrange and make a change
I remember how it was people standing still
The music was wack so they chose to get ill
People started breaking and fights would start to break out
This is the reason why some people make out
Hip-hop to be bad
Because of this behaviour
Then like a miracle two musical saviours
One with a microphone
The other with tables
Both up ready both willing and able
Burst on the scene like TNT
People said, ""who can it be?""
Cant you see it's Jeff and me
We all blazed as musical scholars
Fast admiration ??? dollars
Couple of kids with a bright idea
Didn't want a 9 to 5 made rap careers
People tried to diss and make the egos shrink
But we believe in ourselves so to hell what they think
Moving like a freight train we can't be stopped
Especially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box

*hip-hop*
*chance to rock*
*Jeff waz on the beat box*

Yo cut it up Jeff
Scratched ""hip-hop""

I know I talk about Jeff a whole hell of a lot
But straight up man you gotta give him his props
There's not many people who can do what he does
Marly Marl, Teddy Riley and herbie the luvebug
But other than that there's not many around
That can take that box and make it sound
Like anything that you could possibly want
Now heres a rhyme that sums it up
Jeff is diggy diggy d dope and
You DJ's out there keep hopin
His beat boxers will be broken
But you might as well just keep hopin
????
You think he can your mis-taken
Our records he is brizzeakin (breakin0

His beat box is a kizz- kickin
And all my rhymes are hizz-hittin

We got the party rizzockin (rockin)
We got the crowd a hip hoppin

Mmm lets see what's next on the agenda
That's right oh yeah I've got it I remember
I was discussin when Jeff's on stage
Yeah hands clap
Ya feet tap
Ya eardrums pulsate
Ya body will move
As ya flow with the groove
And you smile as he composes this new rap tune

A lovely Lady comes walking my way.
She walked up and she said hello.
I said hi, my names Joe.
I was lyin', so was she.
She said her name was Donna,
But her shirt said Marie.
Once you get to know me,
You'll never forget me.
I said why, then she bit me.

Ouch!
That didn't hurt.
Kinda nicked me,
But she ripped my shirt.
At that point I fell asleep.
Woke up at her house,
In the back of a jeep.
A Blazer, '89
Tinted windows,
I wish it was mine.
Oh, it is,
But where are my keys?
There they are...in the ignition.

I'm at her house.
It's a Tepee.
No, a cavern
No, a skyscrapper.
No, an igloo.
No, it's a shack.
Forget it, I'll go around back.
It's a castle, with a moat
How I get Across...Boat.

Shooo...I hate that sound.

I went inside,
Looked right, looked left.
There she is.
Oh, no Thats Jeff.

I went downstairs.
It's a loft.
No, it's a dungeon!
There she is, doing areobics.
No, yoga.
No, karate.

Hard like algebra.

And I allowed ya to
Step on stage.
To kick your ryhmes off.

Are there any rappers to step on stage
Cause if you do You'll feel the force of my rage,
I'm on a rampage!!!!!!!

Syche just hit me.
Jeff wanted to do that,
But I didn't.
I thought that it would make the reccord dumb.
I guess I wasn't wrong.

Jack and Jill went up a hill,
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down,
And broke his crown....
Hickory, dickory, dock.

Got to use the bathroom now,
Sike, I was drafted.

",Too Damn Hype [*],1989
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now a joke is a joke and funny games are chill
But this isn't funny y'all this is straight up ill
Now there's a limit to humor and this is goin too far
I ain't laughin no more y'all now who stole my car

Now I don't know if you ever had a car stolen before
But it's a real crazy feeling when you walk out the door
And you don't need a map or any kinda chart
To know you're standin in the spot your car used to be parked
Now you know you parked your car there but yet you keep lookin
Cause your mind didn't accept yet that somebody took it
So you're scratching your head and tryin to get things clear
And it's always some idiot saying (you're sure you parked here)
To call the police would be the move that is smart
But instead you keep lookin where you know you didn't park
Searchin for reasons like maybe tickets you owed
Something to justify that - maybe it got towed
But not stolen n-never forget it
But then you ask yourself well where the hell is it
If there was a prize you'd win dummy of the year
Cause you're lookin somewhere else when you know you parked it here
So through never-neverland you find yourself strollin
Then when you finally accept that it's stolen
You call the police and they come and say
(That's the 437th car stolen today)
As if that's somethin that he really needed to mention
Then they start askin you real dumb questions
Like (well when's the last time that you saw it)
You idiot, right before they stole it
Now you're mad this cop is talkin to you
And somebody in your car headed to kalamazoo
Officer Fool or whoever you are
Would you please get off your butt and find who stole my car?

I remember my first car, never forget it
A candy apple red I ROC, windows deep tinted
Talk about fast like a rocket to drive
Went from zero to 60 in like 5.5
Imagine red rims but that wasn't enough
It had a car phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch
An alpine stereo the straight up rock
With 12"" woofers you could hear for blocks
The first day I got it I was frontin real hard
I could hear people sayin (damn, look at that car)
I was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out
So I went to the spot where they're usually hangin out
Just my luck nobody's standin outside
And I didn't really feel like parkin my ride
So I honked my horn and nobody was comin
I thougth what the heck, I went inside and left it runnin
I was inside for 20 seconds that's all
I found my friends, I said, ""You gotta check this out, y'all""
But when we came back out the car wasn't there
(Man you ain't buy nothin) I did, I swear!
My friends went inside, I was mad they didn't believe me
Now i'm standin outside the spot my car used to be
It's hard to figure out what to do all alone
But then I got it: call the car phone

(Fresh Prince's car?)
Yo thief, bring my car back now
Before I bust your (hold up wait a minute pal)
(Seems like you forgot who's got the keys)
I thought: he's right, ""Well, bring it back, please""
Hello Mr. Thief, don't hang up
Aw then luckily Jeff pulled up
I told him what had happened someone stole my car
I said, ""Come on Jeff, let's get him, he can't be far""
We rode around for about 20 minutes
And we were just about to say forget it
When I spotted him, I said, ""Jeff, go get it!""
We pulled up behind him and man dude jetted
He was drivin all wild and fast
Like he was gettin points for the stuff that he crashed
I called him on the car phone again and I said
Of course you realize when I catch you you're dead
All through Philly was a high speed chase and
Dude was playin around like he thought we was racin
100 miles an hour and he lost control
And slammed my car into a telephone pole
I ran to the car said man you're okay
He said yeah so I punched him in the face
The cops came up as if it was my fault
They saw me punch dude and charged me with assault
If his neck was closer I probably woulda grabbed it
He told the cops that I said he could have it
I calmed down and they got things straight
I saw half my car at 7th street the other half at 8th
I wanted to just jump in the ocean
My car looked like it was a Lego explosion
Why does life have to be so hard?
Don't laugh, next time it could be your car

[ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]
This story that I'm about to tell ya
Is all about this girl named Daliah
5'7"";, a Gucci queen
With gold all over that flowed like a stream
I met her in a club on a Saturday night
The girl's jeans were tight and I got hype
I thought about talkin to this little miss
But I kept seen guy after guy gettin dissed
Every guy that cracked got flagged
But somethin kept sayin (you) (you) (you bad)
I walked up and asked her to take a ride
I whispered in her ear, said, "";My car's outside"";
At first she laughed and said, "";Nah, not yet"";
Then I told her it's a 'Vette and she said "";bet"";
"";Under one condition: you gotta let me drive it"";
She kissed me on the lips and I said (you got it)

(You got it)

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
Oh what sweet music she and I made
Only I was gettin dissed while she was gettin paid
Everything that I owned, she took it
All the way down to my foodstamp booklets
I was contemplatin her bein my wife and
All she was tryin to do was syfin
Every single dime that she could extort
She was Jane the Ripper, and she couldn't be caught
My friends tried to tell me but I stood behind her
(The girl ain't nothin but a 49er)
They tried to tell me but I couldn't be told
Because her beauty was a shovel that was diggin for gold
Diamonds and furs, I spent all I had
And took her shoppin every day at Sack's 5thve.
Visa, Mastercard and even Discover
She told me this is the way that I can show her I love her
My friends tried talkin to me, they tried stoppin me
(If she had a gun they'd arrest her for robbery!)
I knew she was playin me for every dime
But I loved when people said (Homes, your girl is fine)
But then one day, yo, I got wise
I found out she was messin with a couple of guys
She told me that she loved me but I guess she forgot it
Oh, you wanna play hardball, huh? (You got it)

(You got it)

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
The final night that I caught this girlie
I was out of town and I came home early
I caught her in a club kissin some guy Fred
Stormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said
"";Yo Daliah! What's up, baby?
Come on, you got to be crazy
That's your cousin? You think I'm a nut?
What kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt?
Nah girl, you done got out of hand
And it's about to seem like I'm the repo man
You vacumed all of my funds like a rug
But you stretched the cord too far, you pulled the plug
Let's what? Come on, it's too late to talk
It's like monopoly and I bought Cedar Boardwalk
But tomorrow you'll wake up and talke a look
And think the stockmarket crashed on your pocketbook
But it's over, now I want everything
All the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings
Especially the solid gold earring noodles
And the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle
Don't tell me I'm trippin
Oh, you got amnesia now, you're forgettin
Who did what for who, I gave my all to you
I can't seem to see why you did wrong to me
I finally figured out what you're about
But it's the bottom of the night, two strikes and two outs
You can go make a sucker of another fellow
It's 12:01, let's give it up, Cinderella
I ain't goin for it, stop cryin
Like Ms. Melodie said: I ain't buyin it
Game over, girl, you finished clockin

But life is true reality chimes

Cause your taught to dream on
But when your out in the world realities on
You found somebody to be with
You pour your lovin in and it seems as if
Your pouring your love into a bottomless pit
You love each other but it just ain't workin
Your not meant to be together it seems like
Well just think maybe its things like
She work 9 to 5 you work 5 to 9
Never together two separate lives

Love and live happily ever after
Walking around barefoot sniffing daisies
Laying around all day long making babies
Go to france and dancin eatin in sweden
Gambling in rio
Winning cause your cheating
These are situations you can have some fun in
But open your eyes and real life comes running in
Dreaming again a plateau to come down off
Back to the world and see your love life sounds off
Start the day right call your girlfriend
But love and life start at it again
She says baby I need to send you
You say babe I got work to tend to
Love tells you to go be with her
But life says boy get your butt to work
Think of love and life as a rock and a hard place
Exhilarating like a high speed car chase
Heart ache heart break cuts like a knife

She had this friend named Yvette

But I showed up all alone
I told her that Jeff was sick back at home
I said ""I tried to call you
But we can still double date, me plus y'all two""

Me and my crew like to play around
Me like to laugh and joke and have fun while we going down
Born and raised in philly
We go jam and jam and jam actin silly
We got a dance we do at a party
That we'd like to introduce to everybody
It ain't the humpty nor the lambada
More party pump than a damn piniata
You may have seen it on my tv show
Yeah I know I dance like a pro
Cause I get busy and I get loose g
On the dance floor cant another brother juice me
Cause I'm smooth and I move loosely
With a spin or a kick like bruce lee
Come on get on the floor and take the chance
Everybody its time to dumb dance

Now what's a dumb dance you might ask
Well let me take you to my dumb dancin class
Its called dumb dance 101
It's where we teach smart people how to be dumb
Heres the background and heres what's up
Back in philly where we grew up
We used to party all the time
Just playing around and make a soul train line
This old train line the concept changed
To put it in joint got flipped and rearranged
The line turned into a contest yo
To see who could dance not the worst but the best though
So in philly the dance caught on fast
People starting challenging me to dance
So I got busy quick as the music was played up
How you gonna beat me at a dance I made up
Now you know that I can throw that
Body of mine fine so I'm about to show that
Guy who thinks he can do it a bit better
I'm the creator originator so go and get a seat to sit down
So I can demonstrate a dance that's easy to do
And you don't have to contemplate a move at all
Just take a bit of a chance
Its time to dumb dance

Everybody in the house just (clap your hands)
Come on just (clap your hands everybody)
just (clap your hands)
Come on just (clap your hands everybody)
Say (clap your hands)
Say (clap your hands)
Say (now we come to the real thing)
Ha

Well there it is y'all the dumb dance concept
But let me break it down for those of you who haven't got it yet
It's the new craze coming across america
And I really really really don't care if you do it with a partner
Or do it alone
If you do it at a club
Or you do it at home
If you really cant dance then heres ya chance
Go for yours on the dance floor everybody dumb dance

In the past there was always that kid doubted
But now I'm back and there's no doubt about it
The writing is on the wall
(Come on)
Gimme ya mic and a stage and I'm a rip it, rip it, up y'all
'Cause I can flow
Is there another rapper in the world, like me? Hell no!
No one's like me
Others try to bite me
Bad deba deba bad mike me
Someone like me somewhere
To just not hear
Where the hell they at?
Who cares?
'Cause your got the ace in the hole
The simple lover brother
Numero uno
The rapper with soul
Comin' out a little on the new tip
For those of you that thought I couldn't do this
Yo well consider it done
It's the same got the parents
just don't understand the same one
people said that I couldn't rap
ha ha ha well you can stop that
'Cause I'm a rapper and a half
and in the past I chose to make people laugh
and I was criticized for that
some called me soft, some called me wack
I gotta admit y'all I felt bad
(Who'd ya call)
so as usual I called my Dad
He's sort of a fifty-one year old Casanova
He said son, ""Yo, come on over.""
He sat me down and he told me this
Son when your all that, you're gonna get dissed
He put his arms around me and he said son
I was all that when I was young
So pump that point on
And set my sights on
Making a record that people thought was the high joint
Philly, born and raised
I've been
Gone for days
I can't wait to get back
With my new track
Rhyme like lava
Voice like a volcano
I rhyme through your radio
Words like draedo
A Porsche not eleven and I don't stall Jack
(Yo)
We all that",I'm All That,1991
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Intro Yo yo yo yo Yo yo yo yo (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Yo yo yo yo Yo yo yo yo (Ring my bell, ring my bell)

Verse 1:

I'm just a telephone call away
You can pick it up and call me any day
And Ima listen to all you got to say
Cause I'm the type of man that never turn a woman away
Think of this as an invitation
Your heart to mine in a conversation
So when things get to much to bare like The Jackson 5 ""I'll be there""
Just call me up on the telephone
Call me up when you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell

Chorus
Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell) RI-I-ING!!!

Verse 2:

I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy
Plays you like your life is a game
I've seen his type and there all the same
Breaking your heart without a care
Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there
Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack
I'd tell him to pack and hit the road Jack
Who loves ya baby I do you know he doesn't care about you let him go
Where he at now? You don't know Layin' up under some
hold up wait just let me chill
no need for me to get ill
Cause yo I'm the best but yo time will tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell

Chorus

Verse 3:

Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look at
What the future holds for you and if you lunch then you might ruin
Something great don't make a big mistake pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs
It's sort of a mission now you're on a rocky road
But you could get up just make that decision
That you want someone to love you adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way baby you can ring my bell

Chorus

Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it

While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around

Ain't yo' fault the alarm clock sound 

I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down 

But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet 

Work on time  yeah I admire the concept 

You got me journin' and I mean anticipating

And the way you do things you do

I walk in the park for a midnight rynic 

For a slow dance, romance, my (?) of see through 

I want to be with you 

But I ain't hiding 

A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening

Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea

Your new jeans and how pretty your face is

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"
You're trapped on the dance floor
It's locked there's no escape
There's no eat no drink cant take a break
No seat to sit down you gotta stand up
The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff
Your in a cage and this groove will bound you
People in the club like bars around you
The doors open up and the people are boarding
Here are the prisoners the DJ is the warden
Your mind is useless instinct takes control
Jam to techno
Groove to soul to soul
You been arrested
Now your being tested
The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested
Stead drum kicks like pistol in spinal
You gotta dance and get round like a Rhino
The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery
Sayin that the slice aint nice that's perjury
The music infiltrates you mutates you
Grabs you holds you moulds you and let you
Do things you wouldn't a otherwise done
Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some
Ain't no law here you can't protest this
Stop looking around it ain't no oasis
You can't leave till the man pulls the needle
Take that as a warning
Take heed or I'll quicken the pitch and make you dance faster
The drum is the whip, bass line is the master
The temperature's a 100 and yet you still want more
You're a slave and your trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus:]
Oh oh I'm trapped like a ???
I can't get out
Can't you see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused
I can't get out

Now your wondering lost in a jungle
You came in hyped up but now your humble
Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes
You scream for help, blend in with the ??? and hoes
You try to sit but their ain't know spaces
The floor is a desert, a party oasis
I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did
And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid
Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version
I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon
The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene
The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine
You try to move no form of escape
The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape
Party's like a ???
Girls slim and trim on the floor
Don't try to shoot for the door
This ain't the gym
The party goers every night had a scene
This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus
Aint a spiff or a spoof
Boy you better not goof
You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof
The rhythm track from offside's to angles
Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle
You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up
So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up
The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words
Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds
You better jam we don't care if you hardcore
Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]

Me and prince got together just to kick our lines
No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines
Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out
You looking for the late AM this man pull red out
Nobody cause killing is mean
Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen
Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh
Soon as I worked through the door
I got trapped on the dance floor
See this girlie that I never saw
She was looking raw
Came a little closer
Then I opposed her
Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her
??? planes in the damn chain
Hard to explain
I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train
Listen as I discuss this yo bust this
Like a hammer before me you cant touch this
Trapped on the floor like a vulture
Part of my culture
You may even thought I was drived to faulter
Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???
Add a little mic and janet you cant understand it
Cause ??? thought I was from another planet
Way of whipping and dipping
And sliding ??? of what I'm providin
Other dancers go and hide
Like Charles ???
I'm prancin
I keep the dance all night until
The party's over the party's over
Like a cowboy at a rodeo
From mister mister dosie doe
Around the dance floor
Steppin the new hardcore
I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped

[Chorus]

Max up to step up
Just to keep this rap up
The time that he possesses the best in a contest
Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh
No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff
I'm the one dance floor at the station
??? time around quarter to ten
Times work hard
The customers scarred
Your tickets to freedom
Yo you ain't gonna need em
Your sentence is 25 years to life
A ??? is your husband and wife
Trapped behind the steel
The steel of the wheels
Don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how business feels
I walk strong carry a big stick
Sell myself all packed and thick
When they sound the drum you know its time to roll
Might as well have fun there's no parol
I set a trap and caught you like a mouse
For times ahead no chance for a halfway house
Pump the bass in all sections
Prince, sid, and jazz my officers of correction
Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out
??? wall ain't no use tryin to climb out
Cause I'm running this show and it's live in here
You try to escape another five years
I got you trapped and I'm your savior
You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior
But if you don't I give you more
'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor

I Got the call about eleven fifteen
Twelve o'clock arrived on the scene
Looked around and things were ill
The party was at a dead stand still
People sittin' around no music
The situation was somewhat confusing
But I'm a detective I knew right away what happened
Somebody stole the D.J.
Who or why I had no clue
But I knew what I had to do
No eat no sleep, just work
Then walked past this fly mini-skirt
I had to dis her quick before she greeted
Come on baby I'm working, beat it
Come on I'm busy, just go away
Gotta find out who stole the D.J.
 
[Jeff]
Lets, Lets Go
 
[Fresh Prince]
This mystery needed to quickly be solved
Cause there were kids involved
Friday and Saturday nights had no songs
Why, because the D.J. was gone
Smiles you used to dance and sing around
Now were replaced by frowns
And it was up to me to solve the mystery
And get back the disc jockey
I found an eye witness
But his breath wreaked of chitlins
All I know is his breath did pound
Buddy forget it, just write it down
No fingerprints no clues
The only witness was the bad breath dude
It was up to me to save the day
And find out who stole the D.J.

Through the door this dame walked in
I swear to James Bond a perfect ten
I thought to myself I'm working just forget it
Then I thought well maybe I've got a minute
So I took her down to the station
To the back room for some interrogation
Captain doesn't like it, but I must confess
I interrogate best when I'm undressed
We were in there for hours drained
To see who would break first, me or the dame
Then she broke, and her mind was my possession
(Prince I love you)
That wasn't the question
I only want to know one thing
I've gotta make the kids dance and sing
So tell me now cause crime don't pay baby
Who stole the D.J.
 
I scarrowed the city but still no clue
Lost like a cause, what should I do
Then like a bolt of ligtening it hit me
Ah, the worst villain in the city
I wasn't prepared for what was in store
He had stolen the D.J. before
You all know this ruthless foe
To his hideout
(Let, lets go)
Tip toed up the steps
Slowly and ever so quietly I crept
But out of nowhere I was attacked
Just like in the movies, clubbed from the back
I felt like a fool
(Man, you need to go back to private eye school)
I was the dunce of the day
There I was tied up with the D.J.

[Fresh Prince]
There we were both tied to a pole
I told the D.J. relax its under control
(Relax man, we both goin' down you can't even keep yourself untied)
Do you want to be free or not
I'm gonna get us out of this tight spot
I planned this all along cap
There a knife in my swiss army hat
With the blade I cut the rope
(Man your secret services spy hats dope)
I radio'd for back up cars
So we could put this crook behind bars
Another criminal off the streets
Another D.J. back to his beats
I walked in the club and I was happy to say
Ladies and gentlemen, here's your D.J.

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"This is a story I'll never forget
About the day my new car got hit
It caught me off guard cause it happened so quick
When I heard the crash I got mad as hell
Cruising down the highway fast not slow
Ninety miles an hour in my five point o
People waving at me cause they know who I am
Alpine stereo blasting a jam
Put the top down said my girlfriend
Then my damn hat blew off in the wind
I got kind of mad cause it's the hat I just bought
I should of put her out it was all her fault
Day was Friday date was the tenth
My girl was looking good on her strength
She smacked my hand when I put it on her knee
I said hit me again and I'll break your wrist
That day I dressed all in white
Taking my girl to Palm Springs for the night
I was hoping I could find a short cut
I was tired plus I had a rash on my butt
There was this lady in a pinto coup
About ninety years old I could tell by the droop
Driving all fast border line insane
Glasses so thick couldn't stay in her lane
I swerved left and I swerved right
But she was still tale gating me too damn tight
To the left lane I tried to switch then
You saw my blinker bitch

We both pulled off on the side of the road
I was hot ready to explode
The only thing stopping me from breaking her nose
Was I was 21 and she was ninety years old
Then the police came turned the lights off
The lady started crying and the cop got soft
The cop said oh it'll be okay
Wrinkled old bag looking like a sharpe
I said wait what's going on cap
Her cars fine my cars all wrecked
Then I saw what happened in the crash
Her dentures came out got stuck in the dash
You hit me I didn't hit you
Stop holding your neck lady you can't sue
It's your fault you caused all this
You saw my blinker bitch

Wednesday, October the fourth
That's when we got our day in court
That lady destroyed my case
When she came in a wheelchair and a neck brace
I jumped up I said you must be joking
Come on judge her neck ain't broken
Well I'll be damned
Wrinkled old bag started crying on the stand
The bailiff grabbed me slammed me on the ground
Judge said boy you better come down
Aren't you one of them damn rap singers
Yeah, then I gave him the finger
Judge held me contempt of court
For giving him the finger and things of that sort
Anything to say before you're dismissed
Just one you saw my blinker bitch",You Saw My Blinker,1991
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Prince listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
I said my name is the prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(Yo clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

I was in a bar one friday night
Cooling watching a mike tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example
Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

I got a ring on my phone may 5th last year
It was my girlfriend betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the run dmc concert
(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(Yeah)
Aight fine see you then betty
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? 
Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show
Not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince - I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson Lyrics 
Hey...hey Leroy...Leroy yeah did you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?
Mike...Mike Tyson he's the boy that played football from Montreal ain't he?
No no you old coop, he a...he a boxer man yeah let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago.
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard his head flew off into the eighteenth row (laughing) they had to get his head out of the eighteenth row

[Prince & Jeff] I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight and we were watchin'a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes Jeff was like... man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?
Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin' 
Left, right, left, right, another K.O. if that was me I'd a been ok though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring with J.L. and Omar we all called Don King
I said 'yeah, Don I got a problem
Tell 'em Prince 'yeah what's up? what you sayin? you tryin' to solve 'em?' 
'forget the small talk let's get to the nitty gritty' 'me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City'
Yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up
Yeah, you can be my trainer word up?
I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice and yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can Mike Tyson
Man, you can beat him, you can beat him yo man, word up yo I put on a couple of pounds man we can do this you can do it
[Newspaper boy:] extra, extra read all about it Fresh Prince challenges Iron Mike Tyson to a fight (laughing) ah he's crazy 
Ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifthteen row? 
Hey Leroy, you read the paper? that boy done lost his mind
[Prince, Barber] there was press conference to see what training I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing 
Cameras flashing I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little
I said uh I been training 2o hours a day lifting big old cars and big bails of hay (that's what he's doin') 
And I run 10,000 miles every morning thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory (tell 'em more) 
I drink water 20 gallons a pop and I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block (he can do it too)
And 4 million sit ups...in a minute.... ..I ain't lying I did it (he done it) 
The general public thought I was a fool 
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool 
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block there was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop 
It was Larwence, my barber, and Franny he yelled out hey, Prince, you can win!
I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat 
You could beat him man, if you hit him wit a bat ha ha...you gon' get whipped but can I have your shoes when he break your neck?
Everybody was laughin' out loud I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surprise her I heard her on the phone (a thousand bucks on Tyson)

[Prince, Ring Announcer] it's fight day and man am I hyped boy I can't wait to see Mike 
Boy I'm hyped ready to be my thing Trump Castle Casino 
In this corner...weighing in at a mere 165 pounds, the Lighting Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (booing)
And in this corner... the heavyweight champion of the world... Iron Mike Tyson (cheering) 
I came out hustling sliding and grabbing slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin' 
For a second I looked good out there but then Mike brought to reality my worst nightmare 
One punch, that's all it took (oooh) he hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner 
Said to my coach 'ain't no way I'm goin' the hell back out there, man you can't forget it'
My body's like a punchin' bag and Mike is gonna (hit it) 
They tried to make me go meet my doom but I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressing room 
The next day the headline in the town 'Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins first round' 
Some fool asked why I ran away I said 'a good run is better than a bad stand anyday' 
My career is over as far as fightin' but I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson
2 old men: hey Leroy! yeah did you see the fight?
Did you see the fight?
The..the..the football player?
No the boxer, come on man I was at the fight last night I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars for my ticket right... ah, you weren't at no fight I seen you around here last night ..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring you always lying I ain't lying... you lie to your grandkids.. ..I seen it... ...you been lying ever since you was a little kid ...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off his leg fell off and it fell over... ...you always lying ...and it knocked the HBO cameraman's camera fell out his hand I said, god damn, I couldn't beleive it Leroy you shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there ...I was right next to you playin' checkers",I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson,1992

I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""
I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,
""Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

Oh-kay, here's the situation
""parents"" 68 lines, 2662 characters.
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""see'mon toots - my name is the Prince =
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open , the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak
I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it form me

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Right here, right.
(Yep)
When I was a young boy growing in Philly, I
Was sort of easy going, I
Was really a silly I
I used to mess around
I was kind of the class clown
I hate to see you frown
I hate to see people down
Cause I like it when fun flows like a faucet (uh)
But sometimes, some guys mistake it for softness
But I ain't no silly sappy singin softy
When push comes to shove, ya better back up off me
Cause I am 6'2 and I ain't no little guy
200 pounds and homie I can make the heads fly
My father told me never hit nobody first
But if they hit you son (Yeah), take them to a hearse
So throughout my life those are the rules that I've lived by
A sucker put his hands on me homie I'll give a guy
A jab, jab, jab, uppercut, jab
Get 'em a steaks slab
And put 'em in a cab (Uh)
Now I ain't the type of brother to go out and pick a fight
But man, man I really, really, hate to hear stuff like
Michael Jackson said, ""this sorta thing silly manâ?¦""
A lover not a fighter, better stay out a Philly man.
Put up your dukes, so you better start boogen
A sick upper punch when you lunchin' and ain't lookin'
An mx uppercut, aim for the mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'
From da south
And I'm throwing it hard
From da south
Right up under your guard
From da south
An uppercut with all I got
(Watch them drop!)
Put up you dukes; it's time to get loose troop
101, with me and you, and me and you're whole crew
You heard about the uppercut is that's what''s wrong fellas
You're all chickens and for doers getting jealous
Fail one bang 'em
Rumble and all buggin'
All different names but all the same buggin'
Maybe you can take me out, yeah maybe not
''Cause fly into the uppercut (Here they come) and hear you're body shout
Boom shakala laka Boom shaka laka Boom! 
Look out
It's coming at you like a Kodak zoom
No, my name ain't Roberta, don't be giving me flak
And if you step off track, Jack, 
Youâ??re taking a turn, nap
A muscle bound sucker, mean jack to Will
When I walk on by better be glad I chill 
But if yâ??all forfeit and I feel friction
The landlord is givinâ?? ya teeth dental piction
Xâ??s over eyes and birds around ya heads, flyinâ??
Limp all back
Look like I hit you with a bat
Eyes so black (diggy, diggy)
Look like ya must a got em painted
Damn!
That uppercutâ??s a mother ainâ??t it
Step in the ring
With the king
And you take a chance
â??Cause 20 seconds later yâ??all be out in a ambulance
Lookin pathetic
As you wrestle paramedic
Whatâ??s up?
Felt like a truck
But it was only an uppercut
Jus last week some fool got careless (Yeah)
So I got triflinâ??
Went right for the bare fist
After the punch the young man didnâ??t want a fight
I missed his face
But I busted the stoplight
So put up youâ??re dukes, so you better start bookinâ??
A sick upperpunch 
When you munchinâ??
And ainâ??t lookinâ??
An mx uppercut aim for your mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, itâ??s cominâ??
From da south
And Iâ??m throwin' it hard
From da south

I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)

Sitting in a hotel room
A thousand miles away from nowhere
Sloped over a chair as I stare
Out the window I sigh as I'm thinking

I take a sip of the juice I been drinking
I'm trapped inside of me
Lost in the memory
Of how things used to be

I think somebody better call a doctor quick
Oh never mind I'm just a little homesick
Thinking of my mum and my dad
And when I was young good damn I was a bad boy

I remember playing catch a girl, kiss a girl
Like a sucker getting slapped every time I pucker
But I kept on chasin'
Kept on running kept coming like Jason
Much nostalgia keeps bouncing through

There's no place like home

There's no place like home

Yo there ain't no place like home
And I'm itching for the hood when I cross the states I roam
On tour getting the crowds going wild and
Stacking the honeys in a pile and putting em on file

XL a paragon on the scene
Fancy hotels and getting chauffeured in a limousine
Travel the world and yet my heart is achin
I be Yearning and burning for my mums eggs and bacon

Yo, there ain't no place like home, place like home
Ain't no place like home
Uh, I feel like Dorothy so I tries it
Kicks my heels but my Jordans wouldn't 'ize it

So back to reality
Back to Philly, get back to my family
It's fun to see strange places
But sometimes I want to see familiar faces

Like charlie mack, bam, nut and wood
Names kinda funny but as friends go real good
Ain't no place like home for true
And that's why

[Chorus: x2.5]

Sitting in an airport my mouth watering
It's thanks giving day I'm just putting my order in
I call my mum on the phone kind a demanding
Don't stop cooking mum at seven I'm landing

She just laughed and said I don't intend to
My grandma picked up and then she ran the menu
There was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese
And sweet potato pies ooh grandma please

On the plane now my mind drifting
Thinking of the way it used to be on Christmas
My mum used to put us to bed about nine
Saying it's, ""o f t baby, ol' folks time""

That'd be down stairs laughing and jamming
But then (boo) raise ya seats back for landing
I walked in the house I felt the love
And my grandma saw me and screamed

Now here come all the hugging
I got such a feeling of emotion and love
Because can't nobody can hug you the way your grandma does
Give me a shovel and put some feed on my plate

My father said grace right before we all ate
And after he was finished I put a p.s. on
I said yo, ""there ain't no place like home
And I thank God to be here with all of you""

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Here's a little story 'bout a Friday night,
Buckwild, 'cause yo, that's kind of my style,
Check it,
On the town with a girl named Kay-Bee,

And a bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie any way,
I was straight out illin',
Why do I say so? 'cause yo, my girl was home chillin',
Fancy restaurant me and Kay frontin',

It was called Lay... um, Jay... um, somethin',
I was ready to attack her, uh,
Giving the sex look like Dracula,
A little bit of soft music playin',

And Don Perrier, it was on, know what I'm sayin',
Every thing was lovely, but then,
What the damn, my girlfriend walked in,
Oh my goodness, danger, trouble, dread,
Oh I'm dead, mayday code red

My oh my, what am I to do?
Gotta get away, cause my girlfriend's coming through,
Um Jay, I gotta, um, well, see, there's well, this, um, exscuse me,
To the back with the mucho-quickness,

My girl's gonna kill me and leave no witnesses,
I'm in the bathroom hiding like a punk,
But there's bars on the windows, I can't jump,
Exit stage left, quickly plan be	,

Gotta find a way that my girl won't see me,
Crawling on the floor, I'm feeling sick,
Like this some old Charlie Chaplin flick,
[unknown] pound and a round a mile-a-minute,

This time I really done did it,
Down on my hands and knees on the floor,
I'm looking at the front door,
Ready, set, make the dash,

Her back is turned, maybe I can get past,
I almost made it, but then, damn, she turned her head,
Code red
Break it on down

All was perfect, the ship was sailing,
But now it's sinking, so yo, I'm bailin',
I kept on runnin' even though she saw me,
And I sat and waited at home for baby to call me,

I watched a little TV,
Phone started ringing 'bout 12:23,
I picked it up real slow, and said,
""Mmm... hello?"",

She wasn't having it, she snapped, went berserk,
Girl made my head hurt,
I tried to be as cool as I could be,
I said hey, wasn't me,

She wasn't having that melody,
Needless to say, she left me,
Another brother just couldn't control his head, (the other one)

You want to rock, Jeff lets do it a little somethin like this 
From the heart of West Philly, came my man named Jazz
With mucho pizzaz and a razzmatazz
He slice the wax, cut forward, cut back, right and exact
You know the man ain't at all wack
The magnificent movie astoundin
The crowd goin loco, kick drum poundin
People surroundin us checkin the concept
Cuttin up a storm that's why the crowd is all wet
Other DJ's standin around Jeff
Tryin not to give up props to the worlds best
Shakin his hands tryin to say that he can't flow
Cause Jeff is a horse though that they all turn to
A mellow kinda fellow but in the past he
Been known to get a attitude and get right nasty
Snatch the wax, it's a fact not a figment
To get real and rip wheels its downright ignant
And when he step off, toss the confetti
He burn more wheels that Mario Andretti
Jeff is there anythin left you want to say to the crowd

Peep the boy get swift, he got the gift
To lift, with just turntables and (rock) with

He stomped the comp, he got cuts like venom
Doper than dope, just cope the boys def, D J J-a-zzy Jeff

About to toss some action

Here I go again with a groove to move you

Somethin' kinda smooth, you can bop your head to

Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime

Its smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme

So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering

Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man

And I'm just the rapper to deliver

The rapper that can give a

Funky rhyme, flowing like a river

Silky, silky, kind to the ear

Diction perfect, rhymes all clear

Tempo moderate, this ain't no marathon

Step back, new jack's, observe the paragon

Ha, who? what?, why?, when?

Don't be looking around clown, that's right, I'm back again

With the dopeness, you're head is bopping isn't it?

Yeah I thought so. Yo, I'm just kickin' it.



Yeah---

Just kickin' it' â??Yeah, Yeah

I'm just kickin' it



I really cannot kick it

Just kickin it

Jus watch me y'all; I'm jus kickin it â?? kickin it

Uh Just kickin it

Yeah, yo I'm just kickin' it



Just kick, and just kick it

Just kickin it -Ooh

Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes

Who ain't ready, holler out I

Well ain't nobody hollering, 'cause all is perfect

The groove is a wave, and my rhyme's a surfing

The track design

With a rhyme in mind

Bidi budup up up, the charges will climb

Every young rapper trying to get you to jump

But when you're all done jumpin', I'm a git you what you really want

Track by track displaying my ability

The man, FP, showing true dexterity

On the Mic, no rules are lawless

Wicked, and a kicker and my rhymes are flawless

So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya

With a hit that you're gonna get mentally locked to

A hip-hop solid and all flow, flower

I post up, together, better than Noah

A cut, to kick it too, kind to the ear drum

All true poetry, for me y'all be hearin' some

So extra, extra, read all about it

I slam a the hell out of those that doubt it

I'm rippin' every city I been in

Coast to coast, not to boast, but I'm winning

My fans are powerful, and that's the way I'm living

All about effort y'all





Yo, I'm just kickin' it

Uh Just kickin' it

Yeah, yeah, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Come on. Come on, I'm just kickin it



Just kickin' it

Now, I'm just kickin it'



Just kickin' it â?? Just kickin' it

Let's take a trip, mellow out while I'm rappin'

Ya mind is the boat, and my rhyme's the captain

So hoist a sail, and its time to flow

To a place that other rappers don't go

Welcome, welcome, into my territory

Everbody get on up, and get busy for me

Heads are boppin hard and fast

And now I'm getting' sued 'cause my groove caused whiplash

Everytime a rhymer tried to

Say something smooth, that'll move inside you

The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap

Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax

A lyrical painter, the fresh prince

And y'all a know of my Picasso essence

Musical passion, lovely isn't?

But ain't nothin' to it

Yo, I'm just kickin it



Just kickin' it- Just kickin'

Check me, check me, just kickin it



Just kickin' it- Just kickin it

Like Pronto y'all, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Uh, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Yo, I'm out



Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Laa-aha

Just kickin' it

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Shadow dreams
Dreams of a shadow
The analogy of a shadow dream
Dreams are to shadows as your shadows are to your dreams
In the deepest of the darkness it seams as though they're gone
In the light they are visible
Yet intangible and illusive
Your shadow is the true validation of the fact that you exist
Hence shadow dreams

And here we go
Shadow dreams they seem so distant
But the light is strong and no you can't resist it
Keep on pushing, hold out your hand
But light is your friend go on in Caroline
Its always darkest before the light
Nothing's worth having if its not worth a fight
No love without labor, no labor no love
Draw on the strength bestowed from above
What can go wrong will go wrong
But if you fall off a horse just get back on

""I have a dream"" the man stated
A shadow dream that he chased to his grave
Just because a dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should just forget it
I mean you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive 'til you get it shadow dreams

[Chorus:]
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow (shadow dreams)
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow

Every dark cloud is hiding a silver lining
But don't forget to mobilise, keep on climbing
Do all you can to keep your shadow alive
Because your not far behind if your shadow dies
Make sure you stop and you check tonight
That your shadow is behind you when you walk through the light
'Cause a man without a shadow ain't a man at all

I mean I take it just for granted that my homies on the wall
Kids see the shadows and they want to play
But sometimes their stolen, taken away
Adults are the thieves, the kids get robbed
Throw away that shadow boy go and get a job
Just because the dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should forget it
I mean you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams

[Chorus]

Fourteen years old I used to want a Beamer
I guess you could say I was what you'd call a shadow dreamer
I told my father that I didn't think I'd ever get in
I said I might as well just forget it
My father said Son, don't be talking so dumb
Hard work and education makes anything come
And plus a shadow dream ain't as far as ya seem Son
You used to be a shadow dream

Life is a mystery but lets check history
To see how many peoples shadow dreams came true
And if the other peoples shadow dreams are equal
Then why can't the next shadow dreamer be you
That's the philosophy I live my life by
When things get hard through the stress and strife I
Keep on pushing with a full head of steam
Like a train through the tunnel to my shadow dream

I wish that I may, wish that I might

I told Jeffrey buy me a car
He don't treat me any differently

[Chorus]

Lets take a trip down memory lane
You know back before everybody knew my name
Before all the jewelry the fame and the cheers
When i was just the kid with the big old ears
In west Philadelphi born and raised
That's the phrase you hear on Mondays
But lets get a little bit deeper than that
Back when Jeff was on the scratchback
And I was on the rap
I used to buy records at this audio store
I barely had a dime when I walked out the door
I tried to get a break but they could never seem to cut me
Now I've got the money and they wanna give me stuff for free
That's somethin that I'll never understand
Yo I can afford it give the break to the next man
You say I'm a star 'cause I'm large in the land
But excuse me what I do doesn't define who I am
Shaq, Denzel, Quincy Jones what's the category?
It's folks you look up to
The thousand dollar answer is up on the board
Um who is a star
(Buzzer) Sorry no score
People be flippin when they see me around
But yo don't trip just give me a pound
Step up and say hi it don't matter who you are
Come on what you all starin for?

[Chorus]

Out to see a movie chillin with my millie
Actin kind of silly
In downtown Phillie
You wanna see a new flick i wanna see a classic
So we flip a coin and we settle on Jurassic
Park the only thing that counts is we could do it up
Got some popcorn for the theater
Everything goin just fine
Then this girl from behind recognized me in the line
I turned around and i smiled and she laughed
She said how you doin can i please have your autograph?
I said ya and as she reached for her pen
Her boyfriend said he aint nobody f him
F me yo what did i do?
Watch your mouth man i don't even know you
I'm a peaceful man real easy
I said look you got a problem with me
He said ya I don't like the way you act
Cars and jewelry and wavin like you all that
I'm not sweatin you no matter who you are
I didn't ask you to homie

Yeah

Let's take a trip try to grip the fantasy
And I'm a get you hip to how dangerous dance can be
Seem kind a crazy when I check it in hindsight
I went crazy berserk kind a jeckyl and hyde like
Two years ago I went on a rampage
I slipped lost grip started ripping the dance stage
People around me my head kind a wizzing
What a ___ dilemma and underground wizard (hit man)
Heard the sound of music and I opened my eyes up
Theirs people all around me so yo I better rise up
A couple of guys grabbed me and he said to me lets go
You're the new wardon of the wall flower death row
New row a what do who do wo dippide oop da da hoop who the hell are you
They told me who they were buttold me what my new job was
I thought for a second and said yea that's kind a fly 'cause
So to you people that just holding the walls up
You're messing up the party and when I'm getting called up
You better get your butt to the floor with the quickness
Or let the crowd bear witness

(you are dead) (hit man)

Now I came doing my thing in the underground
I wear all black I'm sort of like a vampire now
I don't eat or sleep and I don't like light
I just hunt wall flowers I'm a man of the night
I walk through the club with a gun and a blackjack
My cap around backwards party hats on my back pack
I always try to keep a look out for the party sleeper
And when I peep a sleeper then I'm the grim reaper
In to the bottomless pit they keep plungin
Down with the other clowns deep in my dungeon
And homie if I harm ya its for your behaviour
No knight in shining armour is coming to save ya
You can't get away but yo you try to run son
You doing the electric boogaloo with my stun gun
Then you go to solitary lonely and tied up
And plus from the stun gun your arm all fried up
Somebody said my power went to my head a bit
I wish that I could find the brother sucker that said the __
I wanna torch em up punish them through the night
Put em in the dungeon with a tape of vanilla ice
I'm in control like Janet
Ya can't stand it
I'm figgida like a fire don't fan it
The mind of a mad man seen through the windows of my eyes
Dance or die

(you are)
(dead)
(hit man)

You don't wanna dance you just wanna cool out cat
Well come into the club and it's a straight up death trap
Cause I'm a mad scientist chillins a no no
Psycho socio straight up loco
Taking the life of any sucker that stand around
I spot em in the corner chillin then I'm a lay em down
So call the ambulance to come and just take em away
Ah forget get a hearse we d o a
An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
A buckshot for a booty than ain't getting loose
A straight up outlaw a cold blooded villain
A point blank killin for suckers that's chillin
Cause I don't stand for chillin on my dancefloor
If you ain't dancin then I'm Charles Manson
Coming with the death squad to through your behind out
If you ain't movin jumpin or grrovin I'm pulling my nine out
Right up in the club I'll put you to death
And while the guns still smokin I'm a dance on your chest
The prince of the party pushing with the power
Dance till nine or death till the wallflower
Louder and louder the crowd keep chantin
Pointing at the booty caught who ain't dancin
So like the terminator now it's up to me

Something great don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,1996
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know

But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine
I said my name is the Prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy

But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine

I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street

She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape

I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death

I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo Clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away
I was in a bar one Friday night

Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on Tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is Sheila
I responded by saying hello

She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses

She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing

Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move

I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin

And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm

And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing

I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play

Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away
Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example

Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run DMC concert

(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(yeah)
Aight fine see you then Betty

I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ????
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mon said Betty's not ready yet

I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair

At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home

But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes

Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

Then you having these crazy nightmares

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!

It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin! Cold havin a ball
and somethin bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, ya know nothing real fancy
bout this guy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word, when it was over, I said, ""Yo! That was def!""
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

It was burnin in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool, to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, ""Yo, this heat is the worst!""
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on!
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, ""Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain.""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep;
or gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I patted him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street",A Nightmare on My Street [Single Version],1998

Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince coming back at ya
A-ight now Jeff now come on let me do my thing
Gimme a scratch toss it let me do my thang
What What What
Back shaking the dust off
Knocking the rust off
Your highnesses
Philly's finesess
Back for the addict
The fanatic
The hype fan
Just me and Jeff tables and a mic stand
For those that wasn't down from the start
And don't realise the cuttin is a workin of art
Musical monet
All day to get down to yo
Let em know what DJ Jeff Townes do
This Dj he gets down mixing records
Round the block
Back in philly man the album was late
Gratitude instead a attitude for making ya wait
Time to retaliate against the players that hate
I was giving you time to get the last one straight
Brothers always screaming about keeping it real
Don't get no realer than the mic with your boy on the wheels
True dat yall can run but you cant escape he like a
Man with a super S on his cape
High supremacy
Based on chemistry
No need for sensing me
Your hennisee
Top dogs from the hood
Popping back to the hood
I hate to brag but damn I'm good
Yo Jeff it's been a minute since me and you ripped
But some of the ol diehards might have thinked that you flipped
I heard some guy implied that you lost your cut
How you respond to that Jeff
Ha what?
What's a rapper if his cuts don't fit?
Nuthin
And what's a DJ if his cuts don't hit Jeff?
Nuthin
Now whats a party if the crowd don't flip?
Nuthin
Well we can do it all baby
We can do it all baby
We can do it all baby
Just like this

",Pump Me Up,1999
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Well I was cool and sitting by the phone and waiting for
A ring with a female voice or a date or an invitation
To a nightclub for some minglin'
Then aah my phone started jinglin'

I picked it up I checked the Rolex first
I call one of my regulars worst come to worst
I said, ""Hello but the voice sounded nervous
Baby relax FP at your service""

The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice
""I met you last week at that club called The Paradise""
I said, ""Yeah babe I'd like to go their again
Get dressed and you better be flossy with ten""

Hung up the phone and checked the mirror
Sort of like ESP I could hear her
Heart beating engaged with the groove
And all I could say to myself was damn this boy is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in
Enter booted a Porsche 9-11 then
Girls took a look at me and started to break
Ladies come down I've already got a date

Cruised up front and I was happy to find her
Tantalizing tasty tune named Tanya
I said ay yo babe lets not go in the place yet
Come on hope in I got Luther in the tape deck

I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty
She said lets go some place and chill I said really honey
We went to the beach to take a little walk
I found out I was smoother than I thought

My hands like maverick started to wander
Left and right then wound up behind her
Face to face and chest to chest and ohh like a spindle of silk
Yo this boy is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

Here it is verse trace back at my place
The scene was set because I set it before I left
Girl I'm like a tool grab me and use me
Where do you want me by the fireplace or the jacuzzi

I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle
Turn down the lights and lit up a candle
A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me
Radio booming pumpin' the isley

Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss
Or kick her a line on the smooth billy dee tip
Or maybe I'll take her outside where the pools at
Smack it up flip it naa I'm too cool for that

Ahh I know what I'll do
Hold her tightly and caress for a little while
Make it gentle and slow not faster
I pause for the cause and here's a word from the master

Yo I'm the JA double Z Jazzy
The smooth as self smooth than I have to be
Knowing acknowledged recognized that that's the king of the groove
And I'm the man that blessed FP is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
Ay yo J take me out of here
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
",This Boy Is Smooth,2000
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"(Intro/Chorus)

It's just the things that you do (5x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 1)

8:05, the alarm clock sound

I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down

But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet

Work on time, yeah I admire the concept

You got me yearnin??? and I mean anticipating

Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate

My mind is blind of all the time, thinking of you

And the way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

I walk in the park for a midnight rendevous

For a slow dance, romance, my motive is see through

I wanna be with you

But I ain't hiding

A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening

Things like that when you hear me

Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich??

Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea

But I can't front, I want you to be want me

Cause baby when you grab me tightly

You send chills and tend to insight me

When you caress and fumble me lightly

Oh girl watch up cause she might be

Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me

Sooner or later you might have to please me

It's just something about you

The way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me

Be chasing one lady

It's just something about you

The way you carry yourself when you're out you

Seem to have a sort of captivating style, I've parked the feelin'

But your whip is appealing

Since this is a subject that I brought up

I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up

It ain't the clothes that you're wearin'

Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in

It ain't your body, how slim your waist is

Your new jeans and how pretty your face is

But I feel funny when it close proximity

Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me

It's just something about you

The way you do the things you do

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

It's nothing that you do (2x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 4)

The mystery???s of this world I ponder

Just sittin' back let my mind wonder

What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady

Drive me so crazy

Reply in thought pose like the thinker

I play you with kiss or a wink

Or a smile just to show you

It's something about you

The way you do the things you do

Come here, come here

Come on out, don't worry

You want me to chase you don't you?

Just come here, I've got you now

Sss

The way you do the things you

(Chorus)

It's just the things that you do

(the way you do the things you do) (10x)

(Bridge)

The way (repeated several times)

Si mi cuerpo es tu vicio 
Conmigo to' el tiempo se da con toda 
Entonces porque cuando te llamo me ignoras 
Entiendo que no te deja tiempo 
Pero poco a poco no me conformo yo 
Yo quiero tu piel, tu boca, to' tu cuerpo 
El que hare temblar la cama aqui soy yo 

Soy yo el que te hare volar 
Soy yo el que te sabe amar 
Soy yo el que te pone mal 
Soy yo, why como yo nadie mas 
Mujer, a mi ven 
Dejate ver 
Tu sabes bien, que soy tu hombre 

No se porque 
No estas aqui conmigo 
Amor, amor 
Amor prohibido... 
No se porque

Amor, amor 
Amor prohibido... 
Prohibido... 

Pero aqui voy a estar esperando 
Paciente por tu amor 
Total, lo prohibido le da color 
Por ahora seras mia why de el 
Pero al final te voy hacer mi mujer 
Hoy, aqui estoy, no me voy (No, no!) 
Tu sabes quien soy, why pa' donde voy 
Espero que llegues solita 

Porque nuestro amor tenia que ser prohibido 
Ya no te quiero ver a escondidas 
Mi amor, quiero que seas mia 
Solamente mia 
Porque nuestro amor tenia que ser prohibido 
Ya no te quiero ver a escondidas 
Mi amor, quiero que seas mia 
Solamente mia

Headed for the walk dude, fore' they win him on the stage

The Ferrari top down, screaming money ain't a thang
Tell me when I changed, girl, but only when I change

Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs
Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs

My list went like this, first thing to sever
The difference in pussy white black Latin or other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list just to hear me or witness the greatness

Fast cash life, happily ever after

Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too

Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

No puedo ocultarme entre la gente
Deseo arriesgarme que se enteren de nuestro amor

Hace tiempo que no te veía
Hace tiempo que nada de ti sabía
Ahora sabes que tú eres mi elegida
La que ahora esta noche infinita

Escribí mis vidas
Años atrás te tenía en la mente
Cuando ibas a la escuela bajando la avenida
Amigo de tus amigos
Amigo de tus amigas
Así es como el reto
Ahora tú te encandilas

Recuerdo un verano fuimos juntos a Villa
La brisa fría hace ahora que tú te avecinas
Hago por ti como todo por las ruinas
Cuando la noche como tú
Ahora me cae encima
Se borra todo de mis ojos
Y mi pupila
Eras la única joya que realmente brilla

La forma en que me miras
La forma en que me tratas
Y como me cuidas

Y el amor
De mi vida
Lo siente
Y tú
Para mí
A no ser
Que tenga que decidirme entre los dos

La confusión que tengo atormentando
Dos relaciones juntas me están matando
Y será resistirme y alejarme
Decir adiós

Tu suave melodía llena mi alma
? me trae calma
Reviviendo tu esencia
Fuerte es lo que siento
Tu vida y mi sangre ya está fluyendo
Ya la siento que está muy lejos
Hago distante y distinto
Y en tus besos
Tu mi chica romántica
Jugando ese juego
Como sabes tú
Que yo siempre seré el primero

Soy yo
El amor de tu vida
Por siempre
Y tú para mi
A no ser que tenga que decidirme entre los dos

DJ Kane,"Voy a contarte mi triste historia
La que los hombres ya sabemos de memoria
Son las mujeres, nuestra condena
Un par de piernas que al deseo te encadenan

Ella juraba que me quería
Y que nunca jamás a mi me engañaría
Pero una noche llego muy tarde
Y me di cuenta que con otro amanecía

Y allí mismo me dejo
Con un grito y tres mentiras

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí
(Tracionera)
Mañana lo harán contigo, mi amigo te lo aseguro
(Te lo aseguro, que se seguro, que seguro)

Veras mi amigo con tendencencia
En un segundo ellas te abotan la pacencia
Tenía una que me adoraba
Pero una noche me clavo la puñalada

No hubo manera, yo le rogaba
Pero la niña igual de plano se marchaba
Una desgracia enamorase
Si las mujeres de hombres no han de burlarse

Y allí mismo me dejo
Con un grito y tres mentiras

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí
(Tracionera)
Mañana lo harán contigo, mi amigo te lo aseguro

Y se llamaba tan-taran-tan
Y la de aquel y el otro también
Y le gustaba tan-taran-tan
Ay mira tú que brava mujer

Y se paseaba en tan-taran-tan
Era en el barrio tan popular
Tenía en la espalda un lindo lunar
(¿Qué?)
Y era la misma que me engañaba

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí
(Tracionera)
Mañana lo harán contigo, mi amigo te lo aseguro

Puras mentiras, puras mentiras
(Whoa)
Puras mentiras, puras mentiras
(Whoa)

Puras mentiras, puras mentiras
(Whoa)
Puras mentiras, puras mentiras
(Whoa)
Dime por qué, dime por qué

Never running outta lingo
40 water right back at em with another single
Money longer than the neck on a flamingo
20,000 dollar bet in the casino
I got a partner on parole that just got out of chino
Not a rookie but a vet like dan marino
My favorite actor on the set al pacino
This is a heater man, hot like jalepeno
Follow the leader
40 from califoolya you hearing in your speaker
My life ain't no cartoon it's not animated like seta
Hot like a hot air balloonist I'm just an opportunist
The sooner the better you let me know that we can do this

(Chorus)
Excuse me lady I been lookin at you from over here 
And I was wondering if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we can cud,
I don't want to be your man 
I don't want to be the one let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff 
But maybe we could get to know each other 
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one let's have a one night stand

Let's get it cracking like some broken bones ,money mackin'
Talkin on them burnout phones, cadillacin'
Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats
Good game cash, I stash the store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches
Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires
Hundred spokes wide
With armoral baby wipes cause my baby drink wine
Nothing but the best on the flesh, just like sex
Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus
I don't see no ring all I see is miss 60 jeans
Walking through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle, got 40 smelling like skunk
But everybody knows you can't smell yourself when your drunk
Posted at the bar I'm a star I get a bar
2-way me you're number I'll give a player a card

This is for my fuckers who lets in all my guys

The guy with all the slang in the game about the yey
Gorillaz , marine world africa USA
You feel us, it's sick out here in the bay where we stay
You kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray
Live life like there ain't no tomorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Life is something that you can't borrow, that you can't borrow
Everyday's a holiday
Everyday may we celebrate
Everyday we modulate
Everyday may we perculate

Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot
They say I'm skinny now, but I look big in a coupe
My cousin Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like Ken why them hoes don't treat ya?
If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

I know how to solve 'em
Semi automatically or tre-eight, revolve 'em
Shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit Fifty
Brat, y'all niggas can't bang wit Fifty
For every bar in the rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
For every stone in the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check C-N-N for the ""War Report""
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I'll do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the thief that stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
'Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""wassup"", niggas get ready to duck
My heart is a house, homie, fear don’t live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here

Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!

[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me ""Your Highness""
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly

With the forty glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene

It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

Let's put an ending to chitter, nigga, see me in gloves
I'm the proof in the booth, bitch, read me in blood
It's Face at you, freezin' muthafuckas like a statue
I got a loaded Kay Slay pointed at you
The end of your beginning, before you even get it started
You fucked up, now you in the presence of a heartless
Nigga, from out the gutter, spit it and don't stutter
I'm a gangsta, raise around the dope fiends and hustlers
But silence is golden, and the streets don't talk
Don't let sheets slide, 'cause beef don't walk
We attack hoes, fuck a nigga with wack flows
I'm the last of a dying, bitch, act like you don't know
I'm the reason you niggas walk around thug
Just remember I'm the one made, you can get touched
So what you gonna put a record out, you a muthafuckin' sellout
Slay told me to knock your ass out

And ganna with the ill thieves, slick hammers, we all fam
What, pull out the four, pop the truck, see the luxury morgue
The casket leather, the python seeks your dog
Flashback, he and them Benz's lenses
Actin' like he did ten sentences, son ain't real
He got excited, parked the truck, just leaned the lighter
Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off
It's money on it, until them young niggas don on it
Devour the snitches, you get on, you born with it
Make a toast for hours, for all the money and power
The right division, don't never let corns get it, drama

Pass the rock, you niggas gassed a lot
I never liked ya ass, but then again, you can't be shocked
Most feared in this rap game, and ain't for frontin'

It's the J to the Izzo, you know the rest
Nigga can't get a Twiz-o, but flow the best
I've been doin' this for years, ruinin' careers
Niggas never wanna listen til the toolies in the air
It's the kid that don't be givin' a fuck, I hold a shit outta grudge
The type of nigga that'll spit at the judge
Niggas gettin' gelled, they say I'm livin' it up
'cause I'm at Hollywood with Denzel, flickin' it up
I play the corner when the shit is hot, summer time in the X

That's where you go to find the God body

Approaching in the form of many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode Squad

It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast

Fuck with the kid, gotta throw ya moms over the bridge

I'm the reason custies is comin' to the Carter Buildin
And it ain't no tellin what I do
They may find ya body on 16th smellin like a (*jew*)
I'm the number one stunna when it comes to the east
In the Jag with the .40 cal under the seat
Nigga this is my block, Name a nigga who run me out
Friday come, you and you have your money out
Son, my gun'll bring a playboy bunny out
Somebody gotta die, I'm a try ya hunny out
Send her to ER with half her tummy out
No see-section, no infants comin out
She can't have babies again
Me and Kay gettin money so its feelin like the eighties again
Holla!

[Shells]
Ayo, You boys is silly, I'm next since Pac and Biggie
And I'm Bout Major Figgas like Dutch and Gillie
Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly
On my hip, pack heat like a bowl of chilly
Look - I Clap milli's, act willy, you a chump
Only kid in the hood with elevators in his truck
See, I flash bucks, rock all black doors
And my watch ice'd out like Jacobs store
When you boys gon learn I got this game lock
What you got for your deal, I spent on Xbox
Keep frontin like you hungry, I'm a feed you a biscuit
I got rock and roll bullets, leave limps like bizkit
So hey, its ya life involved - act like it is
My chain light gray like trash can lids
If one of y'all take my chain - none of y'all live
You like, ""I ain't do it Shells"", One of y'all did!

[Grafh]
'Cause A lot of y'all are fakin', one minute is asolama laken
2 minutes later is where's my salamy bacon
Niggaz swear the product the makin' requires rockin a aprin
They liars cause its Betty Crocker they bakin
Not that I'm sayin that I Cook, Cause I don't
I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way
I come up one way drunk pushin a porshe
Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!
I be lookin like a boss
I pop at ya hood on ya snorkle til I have the fur lookin like a scarf
Lookin like I robbed 'em
Tell cops is easy to find like chinks in a nail shop
Holla, cheah!

[Cassidy]
Ayo, get back get back for I click clack click clack
Where that shit at? Get that 'for I bust shots!
Get crunk if you want to, drunk if you want to
Front if you want to, And get slumped with the gun too
Gimme mine cause any time I could run through
And put ya brains on the mini blinds in sun roof
Try run dog, you can try hide man
But when I bust the gun dog, you gon die man
I drinkin rum dog and I'm gettin high man
Say good bye man or a prayer - ""Aman""
Look It ain't hard to get at you dudes
I screw waitresses that'll slip shit in ya food
I got yay for sale and I got crazy shells
I got it locked from Illadelph to ATL
The wait is over, I'm a take it over
I'm a bubble like vinegar and baking soda
Easy!

[Jae Hood]
Ayo, I'm a D-Block nigga - I don't respect wack rhymes
If you had a gat in a clock, you couldn't kill time
Y'all cowards don't want beef, why even start?
Y'all like dicks in the pool - none of y'all hard
Come through in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you what's what
Lay you on ya back and y'all chumps'll really see what's up
On the real, y'all niggaz better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggaz ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - y'all not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole through ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things I'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you
The gauge'll open ya chest like vics
How you went from being soft to hard - niggaz is dicks
I don't wanna hear nothin bout ya coke and ya toast
Liars get shot in they tongue - I'll put the mack to ya throat motherfucker!

It's the ghetto godfather, priest in the hood
Cross the line that's your spine, I'm the beast in the hood
Don't consider that I rap, just consider I'm strapped
And I squeeze at your brain, face, rib and your back
Dog we can keep it brief get straight to the beef
I'm so deep they see the pain in my eyes when I'm sleep
I made a vow to the streets at a very young age
That I would always use my knife and I would let my gun blaze
Got niggaz that'll ride with me, die with me, thug with me
Bust off they hammers, still sell they drugs with me

Watch them float, fish takin bites of they skin
Little holes in they chin

Niggaz is ass, tell a nigga drop the top and stop
Roll the windows down, get rid of the cop
I'm in the hood like boots on niggaz cars
Gats on niggaz waist, you couldn't even tell that we stars
Break down food, pizza, whatever it be

A shotgun ridin shotgun on the seat next to my dutch
I swear for God the Mag'll bust

My niggaz is real, real niggaz see the truth and the lies
Aimin for your head (but really tryna shoot out your eyes)
With every Tef, then stomp out whatever is left
And sometimes I say shit that I shouldn't

Wit them taped-up broken revolvers stuck to my pants
That was '88, around the time of Slick Rick era
Day to day, rolled chains wit them thick knit sweaters
Who gives a fuck what the D.A. say, they want to see me pay
Motherfucker this is G.F.K.!
I settle crimes wit metal 9s and I ain't gonna stop
'Til your brains all over the street like ?
Marshmellow dimes, brick be the size of cobblestones
Acknowledge the throne, it's Pretty Tone
I'm legendary and compared to my work on the strip, why'all secondary
I'm hittin' these fiends lovely, my shit be extra heavy
Like construction workers in Timbs, and plus they two box
Two glocks incase I gotta bump a few cops off
You know how we do in Staten Island, this is Gaten Island, nigga
Not a non-violence sticker

I gave you a chance to eat, but you chose to bite the hand that fed
You took your shit, nigga, lay in your bed
Who'd ever thought this nigga that we sat down at our table and fed
Would roll on the street and on wit the feds
I used to love this nigga
Now I roll around wit a mask and a strap and a grudge for that nigga
Fuckin' wit me, this adds the fuel to the fire
And I'm about to snap that wire!

[Ghostface Killah]
We want them new 20s and 100s, Ziplock money
why'all gon' fund it, we gon' eat big like Big Pun did
And we goin' all out like Hussein's sons did
We stickin' niggaz like New York cops wit plungers
So take some advice, there's three bears

What up, it's Cashmere, ya, your new rap fellow
We in hoods like the jam in '86, hello
You know what that means? Ya'll the rap queen
Bunch of bitch niggaz, bow to your new king
And after this there won't be no more
You dudes, is full of hype, that's what TV's for
So, get it through your head, or the nine'll leave, eight holes in your head
Think I'm playing, nigga? I have my peeps pop out my the van
And you lookin like, a soldier out of Pakistan
Ask them dudes on this track, they'll tell you Cash the man
Whatever he doing, trust me, I know I can
I'm ahead of him, eight miles and running
I'm done busting shots, the next hit, the bomb drops
You cocksuckers is about to die, and -- let's go, come on

[Chorus]
[Trife Da God]
Either you get it through the head, or you get it through the leg
Either way, you graze these bullets, is gonna leave you dead
And I ain't freezin' up, when it's time to pull it, you heard what I said
It's Theodore nigga, we all about the bread, niggaz
And it's time for a reality check, yet I'm celeb in the hood
And I ain't even seen a salary yet
Ya'll niggaz flee when my calvary's step
Staten Island we rep, stylin' to death, pumpin' gallons to wet
And like Nick, yeah, I stay with the Cannon
Lay in fours, get, kid you stuck wherever you standing
Lay you on the strip, play you for a bitch, you punk
Pussy, you dealin' with crumbs, so stop actin' like you one tough cookie
I'm not the greatest, I'm the latest, ya'll faggots is imitators
Air you out like venilators, and bang you like skinned potatoes
'cause most of ya'll faggots is sounding like little Jada's

[Maino]
Yo, I speak for the Stuy, Brooklyn is mine, get it through your head
'Fore I round these bullets up and send them through your head
Last nigga tried to stunt, left his hat full of lead
Left the picture that your see, for the inside of F.E.D.S.
I want you to think, that my gun don't burst
My tech'll make niggaz back up like cars in reverse
Definition of a thug, man, put in your work
And nigga act up, you put his work in the earth
Yeah, I'm hotter than you ever was, real? You never was
Hustle hard, nigga, we get you, whatever drugs
Bet you none of ya'll seen, machine guns rattle
So I let off, and let you feel the heat off the barrel
My dogs rocked up, and got you when you hit the gravel
Been a hard hitter, before the Mets signed Darryl
I'm your reaper, when I blast the street sweeper
You bitch niggaz'll crack up like cheap sneakers

[Chorus]
[True Life]
Yo, ya'll niggaz keep talking greasy, like I won't melt ya'll
See me in the streets, got more Smilez than Southstar
Pull your socks up, homey, you know what I'm about, yo
I was pushing rocks, you pushed the Roc, forgot yo's
Lot of niggaz thuggin', but not like me
Put the fifth to your nose, for being nosey
Fuck a throwback jersey, you trying to be Fabolous
End your career, have you resurface like Canibus
Nigga's shouldn't have let me loose
I'm well when I'm sober, imagine off Cran' and Grey Goose
I'm liable to clap the tech
Make you take that chain off, but I don't want a rash on my necklace
Shit, we ain't the same calibur, listen, your don
I treat ho's how I want to, even got a bad blonde
Got bad feet, so I hit her with her shoes on
Get this through your head, 'fore I flip over, your Yukon

[Bad Seed]
Streetsweeper, cock back, run up, where ya block at
Gettin' money, stop that, where the fuck ya'll rocks at
Bandana on my face, thirty nine on my waist
Shoot you if you try to run, nigga you ain't gettin' chased
You was poppin' hella shit, all that shit irrelevant
Sittin' on cake, and you waiting on the settlement
I'm a grown man, never run, never ran
And I don't play with kids, this ain't Never Never Land

You get bucked at, crew you 'fore I Dutch hat

Its one way or the either
You comin or you gonna watch another bitch leave wit me
The way this shit go, ima fuckin rap star

[Verse]
Fresh off of the plane I jets off in the Range
First class seat but this west coast ain't the same
The rap game will put stress, fortune, and fame
A slow drive-by when they aired out Kane
S55 all cleared out chain
They body me, you body them, support there out prayin
My only wish is to find ya catcher
Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood
All I got is rap for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in Paz and Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy off patrone, tryna get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go, grab ya coat, bitch you ain't crazy
I speed off, gainin and rushin, and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, devyin till the macs and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in and out of lane, fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I be cummin on her grill
Then its back to the hotel and chill

Ma I give you the rush
Damn ma, ya lil outfit got my third hand high
And I need ya to understand I
Ain't really got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind its me

And all get all loud but that ain't my style,
And he who he gonna get and what he gonna do,
Run up on me if he want to,
Out there impressin' his homies,
But he stood up in front of his mama,
I mop up the flo' wit em,
And I kick in the door and let the .44 get em,
I got fools that'll go get em,
That's for him, his crew and the dudes that run wit em.

In the club with my thug homies goin' for the skrilla,
Don't get it twisted with that

Of me in my city I'm a killa.

If you ain't no ten to me or friend to me,
Bitch don't pretend to be,
I'm strictly for the thugs,
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood,
That moments ghetto (ghetto),
Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats,

Never gone south of the border,

And this is what happens when you put 3 lyricists on one record
That's right, I said lyricists, not rappers
And for you haters out there, pay attention

(Jealousy's a motherfucker) Let it go
You don't want no problem, you don't wanna mess with it
How I put it down I come around, niggas already be knowing already who be the best with it
How I step all up in the spot every time you see a nigga fresh step with a little fresh fitted
Bust every bottle in the building and I fuck shit up
I got 'em whilin' 'til a nigga tell he finished
(You weak jealous motherfuckers) You see them gather closer
Pretty white bitches be linin' up like bricks of coca
Make it bounce, stretch and spread yo' ass, yoga
Bangin' on niggas until we probably break a shoulder
I don't ever give a fuck what it cost, see, the money I'ma toss
Make way homie, see we coming through a little bit
Illiterate, but you know you fuckin' with a boss
Yeah we takin' over small countries where they don't know us like ""Yo, who that?""
While we go and hit 'em with the shit that make 'em wanna raise up, uh-uh, don't do that
Tired of telling niggas when you know exactly what I'm on
Get this bread, bakery, cake up little nigga then I'm gone
Y'all see the way I black out every time I beat 'em in the head 'til the nigga run along like

You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up tonight, one of you jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow
You can lose your life

I hit a lick, rockin' the hip, hopin' to get high when a nigga spit
Probably when the women get on me, talkin' the dick
Often the bitch drop when I rip
Niggas be jelly, they go through her celly
And see her tell me she left shit in my telly
It's hurtin' his belly like bad meat at the deli
I have heat in my Pelle Pelle for the fuckboys
Make a nigga have to snuff boys, make enough noise
To make everyone drop when I bust toys when they suck soy
I'm gonna get my paper no matter what
Hateful takers don't got enough, they goin' a nut
Get a fo'-fo' with ya ganja holdin' my do' in the cut
Play no games and I ain't no dame so I aim for pain
I'ma drain yo' brain when that thang go bang
Like I'm Django, man, and my aim goes bang
When I'm faced with jealousy, all the states throw mail at me
So it's making you march, wanna yell at me
When I react they call up Penelope's
Bitch ass, trick ass, sniff ass, ho
Just 'cause I get cash when I spit fast, now his ass low
Go get a sick pass and a bitch badge 'cause you get mad, bro
You 'bout to get flagged and you wondering if it's riff raff, no nigga

You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up tonight, one of you jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow
You can lose your life

I knew a couple niggas that I used to run with
Have fun with, get funds with
Shit get low, I had to bust a couple guns with
Squad fell apart all over one bitch
Leave it to my nigga Ty to do some dumb shit
My Uzi weigh a ton shit
Run up in a nigga crib with the fire you can light a blunt with
Hollow tips in your belly, time to burn shit
'Bout my paper, neighbor, fly nigga, aviator
Walk out the crib, nigga heated like a radiator
Bet I kill a nigga if he wanna die right now
Actin' like a recoverin' fiend, nigga, pipe down
He was gangsta yesterday, he believe in Christ now
Scope on you, no mouthwash, you in my sight now
If I don't get a call from Slay, somebody dyin'
Like 9-7, you hard pressed, get the iron (Yo Slay fuck these niggas dawg)

You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up tonight, one of you jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow

DJ Keltech,"At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way
And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it

A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilby, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilby came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving: rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilby feared there was a man inside trying to escape 

He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before 
He could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come",The Eve of the War,2006

Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because

Aha!
Yeah ugh

Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

DJ Keyz,"You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over 
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be 
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It f***ed me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly 'cause reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He died at 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Ya know

Styles don't smile 
The hood too foul
The lil' niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind 
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' 'cause somebody boy dyin' 
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip 
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas 'll leave you breathless
shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast
Ya know

Trae 
S.P.
How the fuck are we suppose to smile
Man
Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile 
Why'know

Nothin' to smile about
These lil' niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in D-F-Y
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender 'cause he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun
360 waves new gear blue steel gun
They say you ain't promised tomorrow
They got the drop and hit him right in his head with a hollow",Smile,2009

That this is it? Okay (GRRRRRRRRRR)

How many slugs should I plug into yo' chest before it's get filled
Since you ain't got nothin' else to do but get killed
Been a fiend every since I found out how a slaughter taste
Empty a clip of hollow tips into yo' daughter's face

'Cause that's just the type of shit that I'm on
Collect my dough, make the fuckin' hit and I'm gone
I ain't never got's to worry about the aim

BLAOW! One mo' time for good luck - for what?!
He was already dead, what the fuck?!
I be, breakin' my shit up OFF in a nigga
When I don't see, nothin' but SOFT in a nigga

Fuckin' coward, I wonder how it - feels
To have to look at your moms - squeal, after I hit her with the steel
I'll, that's how a nigga blows shit up
Believe whoever I hit up, will never get up

Tell me, how it's goin' down nigga

Since the first day in it, I made a promise to myself
I was gonna make it happen, that's the way I felt
You know Philly never scared, play the cards we dealt
Doin' it my way, you bitches strugglin' for help

I hear your rumors and your so-called beefs
But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch, your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it, go 'head let you warm up the crowd for me

I hate to even be like this, y'all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me, I scream it out
Sick with it, ain't a bitch that can get wid'dit
Admit it, I'm that bitch you can't live wid'dit

And I'ma keep it comin long as I'm here

Turn it up and give me somethin' to burn
That boy 'Kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone, so try to get a helluva plan
'Cause most dudes left the hood broke

A couple knew what they was doin, so they came back like good coke
Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard

I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun

Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga

Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Fresh, whips
Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions
Stunna island, we packin'
Rich gang, we uptown

Tool on that back, nigga
Money and that power

Blow a mil' like it's a dollar

Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel

But I shown nigga how the metal feel

With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga

Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga,
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some theraflu

DJ Khaled,"Yeah, I represent loyalty, I am loyalty
I am the definition of loyalty
I represent the G's, Beanie Sigel
We the best

All the bullshit stops here, let's get this clear
Shoot rear fresh off the top tier
What I'm about to do for you is not fair
I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear

What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?

Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail

Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience
As a matter of fact it's wearing thin
But I tell you this though when the new year begins
Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes
Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you, I couldn't get that rude

And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel
It's knowing what I do I could get like, ooh
You wanna know what I do, don't ya?
Ya love it if I told you old fuckers, won't ya?

Uh, uh, scrap got to pay for this one
I'm sorry youngin', got to wait on this one
The Solution soon in stores
Date to be posted until then I'm on pause

Here's to DJ Khaled aka we the best
Beanie Sigel
(What? It ain't no more to it)
Give 'em more man, more

Well, fuck it I don't wanna stop
But you forgot the gunner pop, tell me who you wanna rock
It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die
Nigga keep it moving, don't get caught up in this drive-by

The breaks over, your boy about to take over
If that number one spot open, give it here
Give my ground, dust off my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sit it there

Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed
By the way the war's on you can't call it off
It's too late plus the boss involved

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same

It ain't good if you don't wait, no

Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go

A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch

Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'

We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career

And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, nigga I'm from New York (New York)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Why'all niggas is pussy, poonani, (Vagina)
Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

The hustle that?s in me, my thug mentality
Show me what to do to improve my salary,
Don?t nobody move cause you could be a casualty,

One nigga left and they thought we was done,
Thought they could get rid a? da twist of the tongue,
They thought we was finished, but we just beginning,
They want me committed, to the murder, onneee
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die,
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme,
Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm,
Did I mention my fast flowin, lately its got my cash growin wit?an ass showin,

While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car
Smoking out with the doors ajar
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island

Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens

'Cause the feeling that I feel within 
No another man would never make me feel so right 
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night, 
But I rather have you here with me, 
Right next to me and that's the way you hold me tight, 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady

That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby

That you and me, yes we can make it

Brake it down now tell you what I feel, 
From the moment I met you its been so damn real, 
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak, 
Can't believe I feel so weak 
Tell me that you really need me, 
You want me, you miss me, you love me, 
I'm your lady, 
Ill be around waiting for you, 
Put it down be the women for you

I know we global now, world wide 305.

Keep disrespecting, in the the everglades they'll find ya,
I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper of forty ninya.
I grew up listening to Lou, and, and, and pumping Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.
I remember the Temple at Oynx, I was too drunk to get in,
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.
Yall can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.

One time TS, two times Fat Joe.
I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all running with zozs.

Flo Rida, Groundhogs always show love before.
Dammit been paying dues, now its my time to blow.
Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.
My dog Nose shaker, come through the block on something clean.

Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.

[Chorus]

I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
All of them down looking for pussy , trying to Miami skeet.
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
When the choppers start a raining, its hard to stop a Miami leak.
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.

[Chorus]

Ha, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash

DJ Khaled,"It's so incredible
Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling
Nothing can save you know

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking

It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)

Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

I'm God's hit man, Chopard wristband
New York crown jewel, no if-and's, top five
I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand
I'm five mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight, but we ain't beefin tonight
That's history, so now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery like six degrees
Or the seven hills of Sicily, I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me but nothin is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a sommelier
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here

It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck

(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin over skyscrapers, wildin out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardos, the car shows
The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos
Cause I love the dough more than you know
Still ain't reached the pinnacle
Braveheart general since nine-fo'
Got the belt to show, certified classic
Nine-six, Street Dreams was blastin
And no way they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin, I'm so platinum, it's natural
And nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin

It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left

[Chorus: Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood would of let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'

[The Game]
Hey yo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watching Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was looking for jobs
When we was really in the record store looking for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smoking
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

[Chorus]

[Trick Daddy]
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you aint cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those things
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm trying to holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, The ghetto will still be here

Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job

You got da cash, then show me
Better not be phoney
Get on my level
Cause they way below me
You ballin' Balogna
Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas
And I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half
Do the vert and a left
Bet da Ave never seen banks chunky as dat
Why you got pressure?
Cause my Impala got pressure

Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat

Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small

Now it's victory

Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line (put it all on the line)
In a hustler's state of mind

I'm gonna make history (yeah, yeah)
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Oh, victory (Victory)
(Nasir!)

Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hittin' slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the M-G-M Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blonds, implants
Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counter-scam
Palm trees, magnum Don P's, L-V monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll
That process is pivotal
My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplatin', there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waitin'?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up
Like I used to cut a quarter up
Makin' all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you fucks, easy
I be on the golf cart, sleepy
Y'all beneath me
Y'all be at the pawn shop, pawnin' watches
Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas
Say you killin' Pablo? Impossible
Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best
Unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth
However, how enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars, lookin' dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it
Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas actin' thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit
(Khaled!)

Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost

I said I'm on one

I'm getting so cold
I aint work this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash
than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work
but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like
the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a f-ck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, f-ck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
F-ck it, I'm on one

Could be purple, it could be pink

Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8?s
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair

And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, aint enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, aint nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I aint buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

And I kept burning and its my turn and
Real nigga my hood confirm it
Now it's 6 2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take em way back
When I was starving that was payback
Nigga where that cake at?
Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love,
But I feel that hate
When I got that ? I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug, you ain't gon' wake
When that thing gon' fly

When I die, tell them to turn my coffin to stretch Benz rims on it
Problems? My man's on, see him, we stomp him out
His mouth, our Timbs' on it
Always smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it
Spins on it, you have no clout, the Benz on it

And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone

The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings

And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some of 'em on house arrest, some of 'em on child support
Some of 'em did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord we gon' bust your ass for that eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo'

I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell twenty three, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I'm from the murder capital
Hoe I'm far from practical
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot

Around the same time she had fell in love with him

Five, six, hide your bitch (Woo!) (Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)

They said, thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon be our year, every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over ""In God’s We Trust""
We believe in God but do God believe in us
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know 'em
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from

My money on a another level
In the streets I hear ‘em hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quotin'
Huh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only thing’s truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
""God Forgives and I Don’t"" pussy niggas unnoticed

But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
Cause now there’s kids doing grown man biz' nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga

The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass
They be drug testin’ yo ass and then they pray you don’t pass

With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

DJ Khaled!

And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
""She's dead!"" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop",Hip Hop,2012

Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back

Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round

I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us

Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed

I used to say, I know how you feel nigga
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Had my hood hating now they came up
I don’t know if it’s the money or the fake stuff
Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked
Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up
Friends turn to foes when you in a Rolls
Model bitches turnin' hoes ’cause a nigga froze
Got them people taking pictures let a nigga pose
'Cause I get paid from reading scripts, you ain't getting shows
Poppin’ bottles it sound like a mac-10
Better be soaked in it when I’m back in
I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston
And I ain’t got an album man, I got these niggas falling off
I’m gone

I’m the type to flug a rollie like there’s no means
Barely all my niggas ball like I’m mister Clean
From the bottoms to the top I made it out the gutter
I’m 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter
Used to run the streets but not I’m running every summer
Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover
Feelings open and about that phantom on my cocky ass
Know they hatin’ I just tell ‘em kiss the paper tags
You’ll be with them pretty bitches favour stacy dash
Puff my rollie,cost me 80 that’s gon’ make ‘em mad
Free my niggas Large, free my nigga Cage
Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page
niggas love it when you drowning in that water dawg
Hate to see a nigga shining like some marmaro
Loyalty over royalty that’s my camelot

A real nigga real life, no rap shit
And I can promise you this ain’t what you want bitch
Dialed me and still ain’t a real nigga

When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga
And we some kid to tell you that we the real nigga

Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down, niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin' cops, ride round and takin' shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock, show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you ASAP but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop get a grip
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new Krit shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

One for the money, two for the show

Got the old school in my old school was to post up on yo block
Yo broad chose like she was supposed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped
I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop

Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear

Fuck all you fuck boys
Bitch, we're real hustlers
Get money,
It's We The Best music, Bad Boy, Coke Boys

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone,
Your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up
Two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn,
Niggas won't make it out alive, nigga

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,

Fuck what happens tonight,

(Ace Hood!)
Fuck it, I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on momma that clip in the back, and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine,
You niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, hold a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
And look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me
Nigga, until then

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion
'Cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop on soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us,
Slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, slick with us,
This bad little bitch wanna get with us
Say she likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out
With dreads in my hair, yeah
You got truth, now the truth is to dare
Blue bandana, it's me and Montana
At the Tropicana with Tanehsa,
Alisha, Lakesha, Savannah

The smell of blood in the bathroom
Body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Over killing, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour
Like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,

DJ Khaled,"Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world

Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say ""187"", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stares, give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth

Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man

Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me
Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce

Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big

Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga

Say please lord, forgive a nigga, actin’ up like Ben Stiller
Jewelry on me so fuckin’ cold, I gotta wear it with a chinchilla
I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade
Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James
I’m hardbody, my flow sick, that Eagle on me no Mike Vick
I bob and weave in that pussy good and I knock it out like Tyson
Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound
Yeah, shorty, she know the deal and that’s every time that I come ‘round
This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud
Give my dog about twelve hundred in twenty minutes he goin’ down

Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (yes!)
I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba
Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor

Just ‘cause I’m a motherfucking king from the underground
Rest in peace, Pimp, name live long as Bun around
Niggas know me, a hundred keys, five hundred pounds
Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down
Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down
All they do is run they mouth, me, I just run the town
'Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns
Circus, it hurts ‘cause
Everybody’s a boss and nobody’s the workers (real shit)
Shit is getting weird
All I know is when I look ‘em in the eyes they be scared

Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars

'Cause when you black them risk is high to beat that case against them odds
Against them guys, with your last bit of money for your lawyer

Disregarding the drop
Then they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot
Found six p's of piffy a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me

DJ Khaled,"We all got to go through storms
We all got to go through the mud
Remember the sunshine on the other side

First I got to give thanks to the most high
I've been through it all good and bad seen both side
Now we in the sky seem so high
And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie

But you know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up)

Don't worry it won't rain forever
I've been through the craziest weather
The world is cold there ain't no one to call on
I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong

You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again

Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first (Nah)
Won't be the last, all we see is cash (Yeah)
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (Liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had that hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off

I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)

Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?

Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga

Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket

Or you could be you a leader for the people

Don't you ever play yourself

I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom, oh please, or don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the Sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her, ""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, uh, New Orleans

Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

You want watches, new Versaces, you want Celine
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting

Seen the two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shopping in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got the see Balmain

How can I give you my mind?

How can I give you my heart?
When I call on it, it just breaks
I put the city on top
District, V.A. all day

DJ Khaled,"I remember, see I remember like yesterday
Vividly, everythin' I went through

I remember long nights, days
Been fucked up on steppin' my ice game
Openin' that door stages then the lights came
Went to Mexico, met a plug, then my life changed
And I was on vacation
Never was with waitin'
Always been impatient
Always 'bout the money
Never been with hatin'
Believe in loyalty, I had my niggas fight they cases
Don't believe in hope, I tell 'em hold they head
I tell 'em stack they bread
I tell 'em pipe it down
Before you get up in the feds, homie talkin' loud
Between you, I think you scared
'Cause if you really was the problem, he'll end up dead
And that's some real shit
I don't talk about niggas 'cause it's a waste of time
And when I talk to my young'ns, I tell 'em go and grind
And when I talk to the plug, I tell him double up
It's summer time, nigga tryna fuck the city up
I remember my first 9 like yesterday
All base, fucked off the kitchen off an ounce of yay
Plug don't give a fuck, he like niggas still got to pay
My ounces 24 grams, not 28
That's the make up and every day I wake up
Grab my stap and talk to God, make sure that I'm prayin'
'Cuh once I leave the house I may bump into a hater
And I might shoot his ass in the face, straight up
Don't believe in hoe problems so I leave these hoes
You did that time by yourself so you don't need these hoes
I'm worth 20 mil nigga, got 100 to go
If it was 5, it's half, it's bigger than O
I been a partner with LA Reid and Jay Z
I'm still hangin' with niggas who coppin' half of keys
Still runnin' with niggas gettin' pounds
And still game to lay your ass down, nigga, for real

Big bridge on 'em, we in the kitchen with this shit
252 grams nigga, let's go
Baking soda check, gram check
Pot boiling water, check, check
Scale on deck, check (whoo)

I'm your rapper's favorite rapper, I'm a trap hero
My whips KKK white and my guns negro
Black, white, white, black, I'm color blind
Nigga if your life matter, well nigga so does mine
Yeah this CM9, streets call for it
It was just a matter of time
And the phone sell the record, fuck I'm still fine
I'm a still hold my head high and still shine, yeah
I drop without a single
Man I used to throw 10 thousand singles
Used to have my dope in a can of Pringles
I sell sac for sac and pack for pack
Can 30, I done this and that
Street nigga at heart and I'm oldschool
My niggas used to smoke loud, now they on dog food
It's no average life, nigga this savage life
Partner killed a partner, go to the funeral, go the burial
Talk to his mama, this shit can get scary
I'm known, can't none of this is gon' worry us
The cars material, money deteriorate
Bitches gon' vanish and fame illuminate
I got plaques on the wall, niggas in the jailhouse
Got my advance check, bail my niggas out
Played my role nigga, fishin' them birds out
When you the kingpin, there ain't shit you can tell 'bout
Look around nigga, who you see
Givin' street niggas chances, Lamorghini, 200k advance
And that ain't label money, that was mine nigga
'Cause my young'ns got the same dream as mine nigga
You tryna be a young millionaire, me too
Move your family out the hood, me too
We jump coupes
And we ain't makin' WorldStar, we makin' news
So don't get this shit confused, nigga

I remember when they tried to play me, huh
Notice how I said 'try'
On everythin' I love, that will never happen
I remember when I made my first milli'
I remember, on everythin' I love, I remember
I remember when they tried to count me out
So I counted it up
On my mama, I remember
I also remember those that showed love
I'm forever grateful
I swear to God, I remember

They wanted to finish me
They wanted me to be miserable

Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?

Getting work from Detroit like a piston

I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative

'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence

You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
