Duke Ellington,"Cigarette holder- which wigs me
Over her shoulder - she digs me
Out cattin' - that satin doll
Baby shall we go - out skippin'
Careful amigo - you're flippin'
Speaks Latin - that satin doll
She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me
Telephone numbers - well you know
Doing my rhumbas - with uno
And that'n my satin doll",Satin Doll,1959
Duke Ellington,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1959
Duke Ellington,"We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be--let our hearts discover
I have a feeling; it's a feeling I'm concealing; I don't know why
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you, so strong for you
Why go on stalling? I am falling; love is calling; why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it; let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it; still, we can try

To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be--let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love",Let's Fall in Love,1959
Duke Ellington,"Layin' about, lyin' in bed
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow

They stay alive this late on Radio Five
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth
'Cause the moments that I can't recall
Are moments that you treasure
Better take another measure for pleasure

Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Now you're here, I'm here too
Could be this easy for me and you

Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Lyin' about, layin' in bed
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said

",Just a Memory,1959
Duke Ellington,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me

Duke Ellington,"Left bank caf,
Strollin the quays,
Watching the boats on the Seine
Come back again.
Where is that girl I met,
That girl that made me get those
Paris blues and wonder?
Why did I have to roam?
I was so much at home,
Ev'ry lovely evening
In a cozy caf,
Sipping champagne
Along the main boulevards.
She was so fine,
Just like the wine.
Now ev'ry day is black.
Please, someone, send her back
So I can lose those Paris blues.",Paris Blues,1960
Duke Ellington,"Don't you know I care
Or don't you care to know?
If you know I care
How could you hurt me so?

Darling, you are part
Of every breath I take
Will you break my heart
Or give my heart a break?

I can't figure out what love's all about
And where I fit into your scheme
Am I wasting time? Please, tell me
'Cause I'm down to my last dream

Won't you, please, be fair?
Love me or let me go
Don't you know I care
Or don't you care to know?",Don't You Know I Care (Or Don't You Care to Know),1960
Duke Ellington,"Oh, here's the strange sensation that's called the weep
I feel as low as the weepin' willow tree
And I believe I know what the trouble must be

Got a funny feelin' from my head down to my shoes
Don't know what to call it, but it's mighty like the blues
Want somebody's friendship and it just don't matter whose
Anyone can cheer you when you're lonesome with the blues

I was full of the joy of spring
Now I've lost my faith in everything
Can't believe he's gone

But still I'm gonna spread the news
I'm through with love forever
'Cause it's mighty like the blues
Mighty like the blues",Mighty Like the Blues,1960
Duke Ellington,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)/Things Ain't What They Used to Be,1961

With a line that isn't true an' you pass them by
But it doesn't mean a thing
'Cause Grand Puba got that game
So won'tcha let me try?
Now just because I drive a Mercedes Benz

The one who flims the flam
The one who plays weak MC's out like ham
I got the style that be bangin' when the flow gets to slangin'
I be leavin' MCs hangin' on my jammy just swangin'
So many brothers try to be me
Only two can probably see me that's Ray Charles an' Stevie
My shit knocks from Lincoln popcorn down to Fraggle Rock
Me turn pop? Save that shit for Arnold Redenbach
'Cause when it comes to this, see, Puba's not a stranger
Get the honies hooked like they kids is hooked on Power Rangers
An' I ain't goin' no where, word is born
'Cause I've been doin' this since Shay Shay Lafon
I tell my record people everyday, We do this my way
'Cause when it comes to my music, I don't play
I'll came an' slay ya or I may ah

Leave another stuck my scoop is how I get it done
There goes the little drummer boy, so purump papumpum
It's Grand Puba, hon
I hit it ruff like Agent Orange still puffin' stuff
I smack some mingos an' sit back an' watch my pockets fluff
Grand Puba here to get the party started
See, I come with the exotic while you're puffin' your narcotics
I'll be damned if this don't hitcha where it's suppose to getcha
I keep it flowin', now would I bullshit cha?
I create styles an' fashion with compassion
While others are simply trashin'
'Cause my shit is simply smashin'

Me vuelve a la memoria

Si un águila fue tu cariño 
Paloma mi pobre alma

why no le tuviste lástima. 


No olvidaré cuando en tu Córdoba te vi 
why tu clavel bajo los arboles robé 
Mis brazos fueron tu nido, tu velo, la luz 
De la luna entre los álamos.
Mis brazos fueron tu nido, tu velo, la luz 
De la luna entre los álamos. 

Tus párpados si por instantes 
Te vuelven los ojos mansos 
Recuerdan cuando en el cielo de pronto se ve 
Que nace why muere un relámpago.
Recuerdan cuando en el cielo de pronto se ve 
Que nace why muere un relámpago.

Se tiende cuando la escarcha

Duke Ellington,"In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete

It's all like a dream to call you mine

Duke Ellington,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much,
Since every one spreads the story
With his own little personal touch.

Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head.

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a change

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're a part the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you.

And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear from me
And you never will.",Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me [Live][*],1963

I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself

Missed the Saturday dance
Hear they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But, nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

And my heart won't try

Is like the first time
Each time you're near me

And there is not a single thing I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you

I'm gonna see the bee that makes the honey comb
The brindle cow will wag her tail,
As I fill up the pail I'll chase the flies and
I surmise she'll moo, ""Thanks to you.
""I'll feed the chicks, and mix some barley with their corn
They love it so, I know they'll cluck for luck each morn
Then I will lie amid the hay
And call it all a day
Way down aroun' my ALABAMY HOME.

Such a clown by the wall
Invited to dance
By no one at all

So charming and gay

To look over my way

So awfully sad
Dissatisfied
I hurt so bad
I almost cried
Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?
But Ella next to the wall
A fella who likes what they see?

And then in my ear
Someone said to me
Wallflower, my dear
How come you can't see
They couldn't care less?
They're not impressed
As you might have guessed
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

Tip toe and alert
Yes, the band blues went loud
But next on a flirt

Duke Ellington,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

I've got to go where you are
If it's dark or bright
I've got to go where you are

I'll go through the dismal swampland
Searching for you
For if you are lost there
Let me be there too

Through the smoke and flame
I've got to go where you are

Where you are

And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend, but in the end

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

'Twas for charity?

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much

I would fly away forever

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand,
Just holding your hand.

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we.
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray.
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day.
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop,
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy,
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie.
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives.
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too.

Duke Ellington,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1997

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep

He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.
Yours and mine, that was fine.

Thank you for seeing me again.

Still the mem'ry stays for always.",Danke Schoen,1999

One hears the restless cries!
From ev'ry corner of the land:
""Womankind, arise!""
Political equality and equal rights with men!
Take heart! For Missus Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!

No more the meek and mild subservients we!
We're fighting for our rights, militantly!
Never you fear!

Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

And it wore, and it wore, and it wore
Till it went, and it wasn't no more

In my sweet little Alice blue gown

I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
Till it wilted, I wore it; I'll always adore it
My sweet little Alice blue gown

The little silk worms that made silk for that gown
Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground
For there never was anything like it before
And I don't dare to hope there will be any more
But it's gone 'cause it just had to be
Still it wears in my memory

Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
Gay as they say it ought to be

Searching the promenades, seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for

Duke Ellington,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room?

I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

But I can't remember where or when

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,2012

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2017

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny

That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,

Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust,2000
