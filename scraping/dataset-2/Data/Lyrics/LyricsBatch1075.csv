Tal,"À peine arrivée, je sens que je respire
À peine arrivée, je comprends déjà
Qu'il y avait urgence à revenir
Des mois et des mois que je ne m'écoutais pas
Je viens pour m'éponger en partant des racines
Mes penchées attachées par la cime
Je pars pour m'approcher de ce qui me fascine
Tout va bien, je suis arrivée chez moi, chez moi

Hey, ah, hey, ah
Entendez-moi vous appeler
Hey, ah, hey, ah
Comme vous m'aviez manqué

Quand je dis, ""hello"", toi tu dis, ""jambo""
Que tu danses la samba ou le flamenco
J'me sens chez moi là où c'est beau
Là où c'est, mais ça vaut c'que ça vaut
C'est ici, c'était là-bas, yeah
Là-bas, yeah
Quand tu dis, ""hello"", moi je dis, ""jambo""
C'est que j'reviendrai bientôt

Je suis de là où je me sens moi
Je suis d'ces endroits où tout encore m'étonne
Où la vie tourbillonne
Il y a des gens là-bas
Grâce à qui j'n'aurai jamais peur que l'on m'abandonne
Ici, pas de terrains minés
Pas de gens malveillants pour t'intimider
Ici, on te laissera décider
Tout va bien tu es arrivé chez moi, chez moi

Tal,"On avance

Si j'entends mes aînés juger
Critiquer ma génération
Je pense qu'ils oublient un peu trop vite
Que le monde est tel qu'ils l'ont laissé
Mais on n'est pas tous désabusés
On manque juste un peu d'air, de repères
N'importe où, où que l'on aille
On marche sur une faille

On avance en silence
Comme tous ceux qui osent faire bouger les choses
Sans drapeau et sans héros
On est tous en mal d'un idéal
On avance en silence
Mais viendra l'heure où nos cris du cœur
On saura les faire sortir
Et notre avenir on va le choisir

On n'veut pas changer tout, d'un coup
Ni refaire une révolution
Un peu plus subtil que ce qu'on croit
On a tous une île au fond de soi
Et on y met nos rêves en suspens
Et tous nos espoirs en attendant
De pouvoir enfin montrer, tout ce qu'on est

On avance en silence
Comme tous ceux qui osent faire bouger les choses
Sans drapeau et sans héros
On est tous en mal d'un idéal
On avance en silence
Mais viendra l'heure où nos cris du cœur
On saura les faire sortir
Et notre avenir on va le choisir

Je sais que du chemin reste à faire
Et que souvent nos cœurs se désespèrent
Mais au-delà de nos peurs, nos colères
Viendra le jour de cette nouvelle ère

On avance en silence
Comme tous ceux qui osent faire bouger les choses
Sans drapeau et sans héros
On est tous en mal d'un idéal
On avance en silence
Mais viendra l'heure où nos cris du cœur
On saura les faire sortir

Tal,"J'ai voulu dormir, et j'ai fermé les yeux
Sans même voir que le ciel était bleu
Je me suis réveillée sous un nouveau soleil
Et depuis ce jour là rien n'est pareil
Lumières des projecteurs qui réchauffent mon coeur
Tout au fond de moi je n'ai plus jamais peur

J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime

C'est une évidence, j'ai trouvé ma voie
Je prends mon envol mais je n'oublie pas
Les paroles d'une chanson d'enfance
Qui me rappelle d'où je viens, d'où je tiens ma chance
Lumieres artificielles qui fait briller mes yeux
Et je sors de l'ombre, je sais ce que je veux

J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime
J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime

De sens en contre-sens, on se perd toujours
Quand on ne fait pas les choses avec un peu d'amour
C'est peut-être lui qui rend notre ambition fascinante
Il est dans ma voix, c'est pour ça que je chante

J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime
J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime

Même dans le ciel qui se voile
Il y a toujours une étoile, qui scintille
Et nous guide sur le chemin de nos rêves
Et quand on y croit, un nouveau jour se lève

J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène
J'ai trouvé le sens de la vie que je mène
Et je l'aime
J'ai trouvé le sens de la raison qui m'entraîne
A chaque pas sur le devant de la scène

Music is freedom (Waya Waya)
Sean Paul 'longside Tal

Dans tous les pays du monde
Même quand la colère gronde
Il y a toujours des gens qui s'élèvent
Dans les tribus, les capitales
Que le tempo soit pop ou tribal
Il n'y a jamais de différence
On dit ce que l'on pense

Take your time, close your eyes
Better keep the song as your friend
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up
Près d'ici, loin de là
Il y a des gens qui portent nos joies
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up

Tell them say music is life
Remember life is music
Mad people vibes
And we chant we us it
To build connection
And we never will lose it
Even in yard
'Nuff love we're bootsin'
Inna this life
Trouble ever be looming
If you face it alone it
It can seem so dooming
Jammin' and we come
Together we grooving
Keep positivity flowers them blooming!

Tal,"Il faudra que tu sois douce
Et solitaire aussi
Il te faudra gagner pouce à pouce

Puisque tu n'es pas née jolie

À perdre, à encaisser

Oui, mais chaque victoire ne sera que la tienne

Tal,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1955
Tal Farlow,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1957

Tal Farlow,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

And good's bad today
And black's white today

Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

Tal Farlow,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude

But such an attitude just stinks

I have words that do not come from children's books

And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me

And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine

He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him

That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains 
And eat an apple every day and see the doctor anyway

What if I can't live to love you 
As long as I want to? 
Long as I promise you, baby 
I'm going to want to as long as I live
As long as I promise you

Well,",As Long as I Live,

Tal Farlow Quartet,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Tal Farlow Trio,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You,1956
Tal Farlow Trio,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love,1956
Tal Farlow Trio,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1956

Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(think it over) after I've been good to you ?
(think it over) after I've been sweet to you ?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

One trip to Rio, I knew you had me
Yes you did, yes you did
Never took for granted all this love I give
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Never too afraid to show your emotions
And I like it babe, like it babe
Now come let me rub you with body lotion
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

I adore you
Anything for you
Memories in my mind
Like deja vu

Uh, uh, uh, uh
You talking about easy mo, easy go
Easy flow, easy Joe
Here we go, there Gino
want to ride with a rich negro
Take a flight to Mexico
Hit the spot and dosi-do
Hater's head, see 'em roll
Rockland making all that dough

And if why'all don't know
But acts will rove
Vegas Cats step in the door
Tantalation from head to toe
Bringing heat like Dinero
We rock ice and be like, so?
Man we sell out every show
why'all ain't know
Now why'all know
I hate to say I told you so

Talents,"You know they say
In every man's life, there comes a time
When you get struck by the arrow of cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

There is more to love than this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take you to that step
Will we do more than just connect
And will you, bring the thunder in my life
And the fire in my eyes
Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and
Everything far will be so near

I have never felt thunder (thunder)
And lighting (lightning) like this
I have never been struck by (struck by)
A wonder (a wonder) like this

Ich könnte tagelang von dir erzählen
Ohne deinen Namen auch nur einmal zu erwähnen
Unter Schmerzen oder unter Tränen
Würde dein Name als meine Linderung dienen
Jede deiner Bewegungen sind erstrebenswert
Und jede Stunde mit dir ist so lebenswert
Nichts ist vergleichbar mit dem was du gibst
Mit dem was zeigst und wie du lebst, wie du liebst

So kostbar wie der Weg zum Morgenstern
Ich zelebriere sie wie einen Festtag
An dem ich immer wieder neues von dir lern'
Im Moment ist es das Schönste dich zu kennen
Dich zu kennen ist wie das Beste das ich hab'
Verzeih mir aber dieses sag ich nochmal:
deinen Namen zu nennen ist wohl das Schönste, was ich sag

I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

Tali,"As the dark clouds move in on me
Stealing the sunshine again and again
And the night is falling down
It felt so great living in this world
I fear the things that are yet to come
Living in fear day after day

Why the hell did I believe you
Every fucking word you said
Why did I trust you I thought you were
My friend but you stabbed me in the back
And I felt betrayed betrayed",Betrayed,1990
Talib Kweli,"What we have here
Is the alpha and the omega
I spit it
Bare witness to the greatest and the latest
They try to hate us

Witness the evolution of spitting, it's wicked and it's decadent
Revolutions per minutes, every time the record spin
Retribution for cynics, like a stick-up kid with weapons
In Brooklyn, they say I run it, the 'Natti is checking in
No matter the terminology, blood splatter artistically
It's looking like a Jackson Pollock painting, it's a mystery
Really should be brothers united against the industry
The Africans diaspora scatter at shattered history
The game missing me, rap is so repetitive
Although I ain't your blood or your cous', it's all relative
I got a gang of rhymes
And Tones' beats is banging
We moving through the streets like we're slanging dimes
It's magical, how the track is so classical
The cats who got gassed up in their sweats like Plaxico
I'm back from my sabbatical
Voice of the future, black radical
Keeping all the damages collateral

Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's also simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground

Hey yo, I'm taking all bets and settling all debts
A giant leap for man begins with a small step
From a sword to a set
To my people on the picket line
Who's sicking of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business model with my spirit
What, I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow's disturbing
I know for certain just because you know all about the artist
Don't mean you know the person
You don't know me
I run labels
These unstable rappers is so phony
I try to listen but they're boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you're screaming in an empty room (Holla!)
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest
Don't get me started

Listening to instrumentals

Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground

Yo, I built up my defenses
When I'm left to my devices, time gets suspended
More than DMX's driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is?
Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything amount to crisis
I make the sacrifices
My history is black as ice is
I don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred
It takes my words, tries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet
With sticky herb
American History X, your teeth'll hit the curb
It's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay
I still flip the bird, like Jeezy
Strip it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music is on then I'm right at home, zoning",Back Again,

We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain

I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain

Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept

Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun
The wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street
'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping, who's the baddest dude?

This a recession--what recession?
Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression

Greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death; only the greatest left

Facing all my challengers, raising the black-power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit
(In this world)
Add it up it--don't amount to shit
I paid my dues, kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it, we stay stuck in the bracket

Took a minute to catch her breath when we finished

What if? to me is the same question I've asked myself
Exactly twenty years I just blew the penitentiary
Imagine if disease, prejudice didn't exist
Materialistic dreams of purchasing that Lexus would be deaded
What if we remained primitive depended on natural resources?
To live and didn't have technology to abort our kids
How about if there was no rated-are flicks to corrupt our minds?
Or if world wars ain't take place and didn't interrupt our times?
What if this free world shit didn't have us hypnotized?
Or cannibalism was a permanent state of mind?
The death rate, grows faster than we can produce yellow tape

Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant

Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air

Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship that later brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare

Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who, on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well

You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star, who we?  (And we)

We be shining and shining, when we rhyming and rhyming

Go from the dark
The other way is ass-backwards
It's absurd
Make you want to crow like a blackbird
That's right
You living from your first day to your last night
Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes
When you froze in
The black light
Dead that
Before you get your head wrapped
Like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealing with that black magic
Try to civilize you
Not walk on by you
Like civil-(lies do get you black listed) it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat
A panther
Revolution is the answer
That's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer
True indeed

Now black people unite, and let's all get down
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision, five side dimension
The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight
Everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two

Talib Kweli,"Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore Adidas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people was behaving like hip-hop was good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said
""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash
Jacking old beats and making the dash""
They jacked the beats, money came with ease
But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder
Set some R&B over the track for ""Deep Cover"" (187!)
The kid got wild, started acting erratic
He said ""Yo, that presidential I got to have it""
With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track
But little did he know that his joints was wack
The shiny A&R said ""Great new hit, G!""
""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me""
The kid got amped and he starts to figure
""I'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!""
So, he's in the studio working round the clock
For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock'
Was out in the street when he met this sister
Who couldn't sing for shh but the mix would assist her
Hooked up the track and in excitation
He decided he'd head for the radio station
But (What?) he was running and he made a left
Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def
I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money
Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?""
He ran upstairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?)
Jane the chickenhead radio host
Who be yapping 'bout beef between east and west coast
He said ""This one's a bullet, you got to give it run!""
The chicken said ""Thanks"" and spanked it #1
He went outside, was getting props all over
Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover
Raced up the block doing 83
Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D
He winked his eye like his star status mattered
They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
""You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static
And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic""
His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said
They told the kid ""Back down, that player shit is dead""
Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone
But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on
With shades on founded had him astounded and
Before long the young man got surrounded
Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was out chasing cream and the American dream
Trying to pretend the ends justify the means
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
Life is more than what your hands can grasp
Good night!",Children's Story,1998
Talib Kweli,"Lord, lord have mercy
All nice and peace and true, follow me now, we say
Say Hi-Tek yes you're ruling hip-hop
Say J. Rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop
Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop
Say Black Star come to rock it non

Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin'
Connectin' like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents, heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn whoa
See that?  Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sellin' tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at

Brooklyn, New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity. Blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin' MC is short hand for Mis Conception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walkin' the streets is like battlin', be careful with your body
You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin' and talkin' about
""I knew he'd amount to nothin'""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was frontin'?""
Talkin' and loud like you in RCA, get carted away
With body parts and treys, what a way to start your day
Yo it's like

One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one two three
It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

I said Manhattan keep on makin' it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin' it (Bo!)
So relax we're takin' it back, Redhook where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin' not hustlin' and bubblin'
It ain't about production and, what else we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed
Colossal, true original B-boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the, Zulu gestapo

You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked Buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spittin' the epitome, of stupidity, livin' my life
Expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty
People follow me and other cats they hear him flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano

Still sippin' wishin' well water, imported, from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheaters
A cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up, thinkin' we will ease up

Every day somebody ask me where all the real MC's is at?
They underground
There's mad talented cats underground with that raw shit
Yaknowwhat'msayin? Bringin them raw skills
YaknowwhatI'm sayin?
Really, to me

It's a Small Wonder, like Vicki, why I'm picky
These niggas suck like hickies
And still get to slip they shit in like Mickies
I'm sick of the hater-players, bring on the regulators
With the flavors like a farm team fucking with the majors
Like a river how I run through it, I do it so cold
Freezin up your bodily fluids, your style is old
You runnin your mouth, but don't really know what you be talkin about
You should retire, get that complimentary watch, be out!
Yo, with the quickness, so swift you miss this lyrical fitness
Now get this, these emcees wanna test me like litmus, bear witness
I'm like shot clocks, interstate cops, and blood clots
My point is, your flow gets stoped!
By all means, you need more practice, take that ass home
Everybody lookin at you, fish tank syndrome
In full effect, I stay catchin lyrical rep
And keep it blacker than the back of your neck
What you expect, emcees hollerin
Cause we developin the followin
Gettin played like stone love tapes and dollar vans
Order reverse your universe so your demise is first
Before your rise it gets worse
You need a night nurse like Gregory
Beggin me - stop it hurts! - is what you say to me
Like that's supposed to mean somethin?
You the one I seen frontin in the club
Your act I don't buy it, I got the dub
Come on everybody, come on just show your love

Visions occupy my synaptic space
Command and shape, to illustrate my mind's landscape
The tall grass, the low plains, the mountanous ridges
Thickets among the forests, rivers beneath the bridges
Presence of hilltops, lit up with tree tops
Eavesdrop; and hear the incline of sunshine, nine
Stones in orbit, refuse to forfeit
They all form a cipher, and they came to absorb it
I follow suit, and face it, embrace it
Shinin bright, but still I'm careful not to waste it
Destined to rise, because I'm basement adjacent
Spirit is still so just chill and be patient
Some heads approach like I'm the one to base with
Clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh...
I ain't your student so I ain't to be tested
I'm majestic, I represent my strength without effort
My, method is unorthodox, but of course it rocks
My serious synopsis will drop kick, my topics
Run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience
I must represent, I don't come off with no corniness
It's all luminary, despite commentary
Some people say, Mos how you get so?
My sign will make you jump around like calypso
And, murmur to yourself like a schizo
There ain't no bottom on the ???

Come on
Here we go, Blackstar, hop on the Blackstar line
We bout to take y'all home
YaknowwhatImean? Here we go

We got all markets on lock
From meat to stock
Black Star, what? Throwin like Kid Rock in bars
Men flock to where we are, cause its the place to be
I grab my paint, jump on stage and deface emcees
We sell our souls like Spawn and come for the throne I sit upon
Freestyle or written songs, shit we can get it on!
Going back and forth, forth and back, all across the track
Passin the mic's like quarterbacks
Of course its phat, get off of that!
Reverse psychology got em scared to say when shit is whack
Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!
We ain't havin that reachin past the star status that you grabbin at
My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat
So floss, cause what it costs ain't worth it to me
Cause I'm the one these Spice Girl emcees Wannabe
But they can't, ain't no points for effort, so why bother?
Cause your girl calls my name out like Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter!
(I be strokin, that's what I be doin)
Aiyyo, as we rock harder
And always drop the bona-fide head nodders
Aiyyo, later for the hater-players

Talib Kweli,"So many emcees focusin on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin the spots, with conversations
Come on let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation

We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE
Singin is swingin and writin is fightin, but what
They writin got us clashin like titans it's not excitin
No question, bein a black man is demandin
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?
That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin my representation

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin over time and you follow the Roman calendar
These people into cloning like Gattaca, you can bet
They tryin to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages
You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination
Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape..

From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Niggas is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Living to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We Die Hard like the battery done in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo, no Menudo
Cause you pseudo, trying to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like hair locks, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soaking up pillows, weeping like willows
Still mo' blacks is dying, kids ain't living they trying
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applying
Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners
Rocking ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rocker before Funkmaster Flex was rocking Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosing with every breath I'm enhancing
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fag
So I run through em like, flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick, did Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, enter a millennium
Where cats will hold a gat to your back, like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, try to ? the ?
Official b-boy gentlemen won't turn off at the interim
Born inside the winter one, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioning the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon or danish rings by entammen
Rush up on adrenaline, and get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, SKIN possess melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, making 'em woop
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot oppression rent who burn down your chief tepee
You see me?

Talib Kweli,"Escúchela la ciudad respirando

The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options, no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure, cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they bust strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
How the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Kiss the eyes goodbye I'm on the last train leaving",Respiration,1998
Talib Kweli,"""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us while we finding beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills
Or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal, what's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal they be reciting my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong (Only aggressive)
Not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite (Now who the nicest?)
Not good but well behaved
(Chasing after death, so we can call ourselves brave?)
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice

Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually, speaking loudly
Saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screaming ""brand new"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed, not live, we just exciting
Cause the captors own the masters to what we writing
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved cause the camera survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave/Great
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory like that y'all

A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
(They ain't looking around)

Niggas take my name in vain like I was cocaine
My affirmations kill emcees like assassination
Bringin' you pain until you wish you had a vaccination
Or vaccine, I shine like Vaseline
Gas plays like petroleum, walk over them like linoleum
My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
Niggas just don't understand my reasons, I transcend like season
And scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name, yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cuz I attack wit' the estrogen
Rhyme against the best a men, Jane burn it up
When you hear it in the whip, tell your man to turn it up!

Yo, we fortified live, supportin' allies
The wack is tryin' to shorten our lives, it sorta waters my eyes
But here is some'n the cryin' talk about
The verse on that cassette you and cousin fought about
That led to God and Satan's fallin' out
Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out
On 3-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house
Revive or ruin, my theories of mics
Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes
Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock
So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help
Now don't rewind, get it the first time
Shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers, succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results in more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils
Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal what

My style highlights like fonts when I burn heads like a conk
Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch
Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations
My fascination with character assassination
Got these niggas burnin' like sensation
We keep it hot like matches and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So YOU GO! To every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram)
My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos
So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean
Like a squeegee, we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus
Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist
You stoppin' us is preposterous, like an androgynous misogynist
You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran
Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine
But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door
I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'

This is twice inna lifetime so I'm lettin' you know (let 'em know yo!)
Blackstar, Wordsworth, Punchline and Jane Doe (yo!)
Lyrical com-pete and WE emcee
We got the fortified five, exhibit level degree

Check it
I keep dough in my pocket while you follow the false prophet
Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment
I touch topics that try to open up your optics
Vacate in the Tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects
Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men
Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon
Fuck the squad you in, a-yo we be the biddomb
Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on
Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!)

I build with friends, lyrically spit gems
Call me diamond, cuz I'm your girl's best friend
Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers
I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor
And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya
Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors
My gat claps, 50% of the wack
Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' the fat cap
Get robbed for your ASCAP, leave you inside
Fortified live, reppin' NY 'til I die!

Black body radiation situation that we workin' wit'
My verb exists enlisted by the bogeys campin' services
The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness
We are, hot like black tar, Black Star with emergence
Superlative, you fabricated like the word absurditive
I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live
To Brooklyn where the merchants live
Next door to the murderers
And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative
My memory is furnished with, back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps
Legendary athletes who play by the trash heap
My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet
Treadin' on these stompin' grounds you better catch some black feet
Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky
Off the meter like an out of borough taxi
They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty
That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie
Mayor Rudolph can screw off! You too soft to stop us
You and your coppers should see some foot doctors
Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up
Cuz all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up

Black is serious, black is a feeling, black is us the beautiful people

That was when some of them bad niggas made beauty moving juju changes the drum 
Music hum! Mojo vibrated and high jons screamed through the bloods to no one 
Hears the blood sounds no more folk intercourse's and all the niggas listening 
Acted visionaries too dig my people they acted the rhythms pulling there minds 
Was one and move move move universe earth spirit firing the soils to destroy 
The evil un image cleanse the waste from the cold lands till the cosmos was 
Whole again and the worlds had become nude

Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy, who dreamed about being a big man
On small loose leaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but now a day it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back, that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seeking the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano

You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me? I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat, and what I bleed
MC's imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off, you come across soft
Back in the days, niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guest list
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless

Truth had me up against the ropes 
And semi-conscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watchin' the clock is ill when, faced wit the truth
Parallels observing, amateur video tapes of
Twenty-one top notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill they minds not to kill still son, never revealed
True feelings, we speakin' on the truth right now in itself is a healing
See The Creator, created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to earth!
Sorta similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside on the outside you frontin' you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well-hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden, that's the truth

In due time we will find

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go
To find it, time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speakin' 'cause it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin' us we born sinners
Venders of hate, got me battlin' my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonderin' why I gotta drink a six pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live
Said I got to get more than I'm given
'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion
After searchin' the world, on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth

Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest bits of saliva juices like the roots is
More organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death, unless
The way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'Cause the truth give the words away to the planet goddammit
I ran wit what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be the bring the light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (why?) 'cause we keep marchin' on (True)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin' on (True)
You can't see it if you blind but we will always prevail (True)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed in the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

Because political power come from the barrel of it

To make a rat sing like Nat King
Before they start blasting (blow!)
With no accuracy, handling they beef in the public
Now an innocent child got a bag for a stomach
Property value plumit every time a shot is fired (c'mon)
People feelin betrayed so they take the street to riot
Cops fire shots and try to stop the spirit takin over the entire block
Politicians say it's time to march
But people is past that, ready to blast at whatever comin
From the master or from the office, niggas is sick of runnin
Yeah, all my soldier, raise it up, see'mon, now
(Bust ya guns) yeah, Kweli with dead prez, see'mon
(Blow blow)

(stic.man)
I'm deep in the runs 
Where all that niggas give a fuck about is stackin funds
The black and young type that's packin automatic guns
If any static comes sparatic shots'll ring out
You get caught up, you get your fuckin brains blown clean out
The killers reign supreme, survival of the illest brain and scheme
For cream you know the game in my vein
I feel the pain for all the niggas that passed away
Tryin to get cash the fastest way we know how, the old fashion way
Blastin, we actin like cock tecs and tenniments
My squad flex if any shit pop, and put an end to it
It's like hell, this planet I'm from consist of dilligent crack sale
Assisting off the backs of young black males
It's innocent, suspending in packed jails that benefit
White well being, while niggas catch hell just for being
You might as well have a life of crime, ain't nothin free in this life
I stick a nine in ya spine for mine
No time for talk, 'cause I walk when I talk
Stalkin sidewalks of course with the eyes of a hawk
Crack a quart to get away from this trife world and thought
Puffin Newports 'cause life's a bitch, and it's too short
My crew sport leather, gold, camoflauge, rugged denim
Deadly in venom, totin buckets with nothin in 'em
But Rawkus, some ill mothafuckas for real
Straight hustlas with nothin but a taste for kill

Dodgin' users from the other sex
I wonder if my own people will be next
I need respect that don't come with no weekly check
I know ghetto millionaires
They got cold chillin stares
And drug-dealin airs
They make hairs stand up on the backs of necks of ¿mayors?
Who blow up fish markets and got various targets
They sweepin' shit under carpets
I move stealth through the chicken-heads
With talcum on they chests
Yo Malcom's gone
And the elders ain't impressed with my struggle
I try to make a profit and I'll flip it so it double
Being poor just ain't worth the trouble
Extension of my mansion 
Where I keep my stacks
Deep in the study where my nerve endings react
There ain't no stoppin me
My feelings and thoughts I have monopolies
Magnetic fields and fields of dreams is my property
Poor people who are stupid die quickly
I'm a millionaire that's carrying all my assets with me
I go past the physical world like Sufis
My people's was sold one-by-one like Lucy's
These niggaz got grams but no lands yo you losin me
Watch that first step, its a doozie

They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa

We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine

Talib Kweli,"What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin' you can really prepare for

Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and
My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and
Big L, rock rock on and

Jerome Green, rock rock on and

Talib Kweli,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Universal love

Talib Kweli,"Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

Bringing back sweet memories

Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son

Bringing back sweet memories

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)

Bringing back sweet memories

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun
Like wow!
We made it
We here",Memories Live,2000

Consistant, motivation, resistance to stagnation

To keep myself from soundin loc'
Destroy they hopes of hatin
Don't move aboard before they rock the boat
Yo it's not the dope
These snakes will come in peace to slit your throat
Give you compliments, with a promise yet

And get bumped out the back of impalas and cadillacs
All my live cincinatti bearcats holla back

Quickly call that ass a liar, exposin you's my last desire

Cause I endanger the motherfuckers, they needin' preservation

Puffin' vegetables and now I'm red to go

Burn leech niggas like salt when i lay in the cut
Think you about to blow when you continue to suck
The shit I've been through
Make me run up in your venue like What!
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd what are y'all waitin' for?
They say nothin' but that fat shit
I got you, say no more i laid the law and all them
Crab rappers played the floor I called them out
A couple of them steeped up and I ate 'em raw
Some more wack niggas tried to spray the door but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in they face with a methaphor
For better or for worse you better call the nurse
Before I send a cleaner and he get to your hospital room first

And shut it down, cut it down like rain forest
You see Talib Kweli when you look up the idlest in the thesaurus
I'm the definition of special edition with rack and pinion steering
To make my handling more smooth than aloe and lanolin
Manifesto spitting, my stiletto's hitting
On a ghetto mission to keep it fabulous 
Like a Lone Catalysts composition

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry

On a level of metaphors with lies life seems to depreciate
Like automobiles submit its original state
I'm into brothers with registered plates 
Pushing the weight of my spirit
Passing the limit of speed, rhymes per minute
Cerebral engine is infinite
Class, the third eye high beams illuminates the distance
The pressure on pedals accelerates, racing the currents of winds
Making the intangible bend with aerodynamics and panoramic visioning
I see the world we livin in, five gallons of knowledge
A tank full filled with lessons
My temperature gauge measures all of the blessings
For the miles I'm stretching
Passing what is hot and what you got for all you cats on the list
Cause us to be the Catalysts
Of a new era, correcting errors
Learn to love it or leave it alone
Reciting these Nubian poems
From NYC to ATL we got continuous flows

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry",Due Process,2001

Talib Kweli-Verse 1:

It's a funky sen-sa-tion ain't it?
I'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
It was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
Like when it come out you out the door racin to the store (*zoom*)
It took a lot of perse-verance and patience
We was preparin for our place among the ancients
Yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo I hate to see a fake MC
I take out all my competition from like A to Z
Cause I get fly more frequently than a travel agency
That's what I'm made to be, hip-hop through my artery
An important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
It got me, rockin retardedly
Pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
Anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and I don't do dat
You lingerie MC's I see through that
I make a point about you and your crew, go ""Tru dat""
Who dat? It's the Reflection
Remember the name, slid in the game before the ""2000 Season"" came
Breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast Babylonian towers out of position
It's the Reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
We make you disappear like tears in the rain
The fears in your brain is clear when I appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
I got more lines than co-CAINE that's why you sniffin' around
We diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
Straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
You got a issue with that then it ain't my problem kid
Y'all niggaz gotta eat, we gotta live, yo

Talib Kweli-Verse 2:

We remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
I got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like Saddam Hussein
and rocks with the impact
Gettin beat with socks filled with ten-packs of tokens
Men's backs get broken when I get open
Words more than spoken
Most of dem MC's on the first thing smokin
Leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
We stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
These cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
Tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
More desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
I burn MC's like Coca-Cola through the paint on your whip
Shit! My rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
When I shine my light through it, I burn up everything in my path
Last Dragon like Lee-roy (sho' nuff) rock for the b-boy
My rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key-loid
Destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d-boy, my culture
It's not that I hate, y'all just p-noid cause y'all fake
Embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
And never hesitate to call out my name!
I ain't effected by the negative
It's the Reflection and we dealin with the positive
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's the Reflection kid
Never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
You're too sensitive, checkin out our references

Hi-Tek on the boards, Kweli in the booth
Make 'em feel it in they bones with the..
Come down yo..

Like, oh my God, what do we have here?
My man is on fire like the Ohio Players
Throw yo' hands in the air, keep 'em there if you with me
The MPC-60 is rare, but it still sound cripsy
Kicks and snares take 'em from elsewhere, samples is hard to find
We don't just act divine, we are
We walkin upright, you lack spine
I don't just write rhymes
I send force through pipelines to like minds
My light shine so bright it do be, vital like lifesigns
The night time is the right time for a battle so it's special
When cats don't just say your joint is hot, cats say ""Yo I respect you""
Put yo' fist in the air when you hear the manifesto
You had any prior doubts to my skills? Time to let go
Hi-Tek, the beats is right beside the soundgarden
Tracks get in the vein like heroin the way heads be noddin
Officially, people love our company like they was misery
I'm known to blast MC's with the cannon of history
Specifically the ones who forgot where they come from
So it's the light that they run from like roaches
Whenever the truth approaches
I attack the track ferocious, never lose my focus
Hold this true hip-hop, closest to my heart, and you know this
Nowadays it's hopeless and my diagnosis
Is to grab the microphone and be the dopest, you can quote this
Niggaz sound like they injected with collagen
You followin these hollow men no honor when 
You bite off more than you could chew or could be swallowin
Sorry man I ain't got no pity for you to wallow in
Quit hollerin before you get stomped out with my Solomon's

Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writing for
I'm writing to show you what we fighting for
Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spelling in phonetically
If not then just let it be like Nina Simone
You probably (ably) don't listen be	
Even when we suffer loses I account the victory
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept cause his dad's away
Stop crying be strong is what I had to say
To my little man named Amani (mani)

Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (body)

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginning I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga, never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower
Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure, this shit ain't over
Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo,
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flow Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow though

Like it's a special honor
The stealth bomba, gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla, inter-conta-nental
Takin you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original, cavemen quest for my fire
Express my desire to drop this new shit
These record executives keep tellin me y'all stupid
Now if they right, shut the fuck up!
Revolutionaries throw your guns up
Whether you a bourgeois broad who actin stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin the club up
We gonna make y'all feel this, break y'all spirit
If y'all fake that realness, word we bringin it
Ringin it in from the new millenuim to way after that
I call these cats reynolds cuz they plastic wrap

Kill all the yappin lets make it happen
You cats ain't real, you just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization

Ride along with cats who live great and die strong, word
We gonna rock till nothin else matters
Y'all catch bodies, we catch excellent cadavers
Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we pepperment altoids
Step in the high reppin the spot called flatbush
Whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity

Still run it up it, liquor in your cup
Fucking you up
Hang over the banister

Ain't no love, you only love bringing hate to the game
Taking my name in vain, mistaking license for freedom
He make music for the people, people dying to meet him
People!
We still abuse it, while the rich is made of music
He probably driving a Buick and be rocking van--- ?
G-you-E relevant, see how his man do it
Fucking with niggas from illa fifth, see how we ran through it
The river in the valley
The nigga in the alley
Rolling with the heat from BK to killer Cali
The hands will fake the clapping
You'll be collasping
You softer than the land on legs
Transforming the landscape
Like a sandstorm in the Sahara

Heavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them

We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through ""epidodes ii,"" like ""attack of the clones""
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by just to get by

Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The tv got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love

How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on

Pioneers of gun slang
Supply you with them things

Co Coi Coi! the sounds of guns busting
Co Coi Coi! your heart just start pumping

From a 22 derringer

A 44 desert eagle, a glock 9

I make the streets run red

Talib Kweli,"A keynote speaker's about to come on now
I just wanted to say a few words about him
And you all know who he is
Talib Kweli
Please, hold your applause 'til the end
We are glad
To come
And hear you speak
We love it!
Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but
One time we were drivin'
Through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road
And he didn't have any, shoes on
He didn't have a, shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man 
But Kweli said, ""Stop the car, beause that brotha, might be in trouble""
And I stopped the car
Kweli said to the man, he said
""Brotha, are you OK? Do you need a ride somewhere?""
And the man looked at Kweli and said
""Shh, I'm escapin'""
And Kweli took him by the hand and said
""My brotha, you didn't get the memo
We have been free
For some time now""
Well, I'm windin' it up
Please welcome

Talib Kweli,"We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be percieved as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder, asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride",The Proud,2002

Talib Kweli,"Go right to left, left to right
Middle passage connection
Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
Yo, here we go

I want to write away
I want to write here
I want to write brave words to fight fear
Write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day
But nothing to say
Well I'm way ahead by light years
So beware we keep the lights on
I want to write the songs from right to wrong
Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I want to right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

And the story line goes on
Right to left, who's right who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride
I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and sing my song
I'm passin on the moral y'all
This is ain't play
True, you got to know the way
It's hard now
Open eyes
See hopeful lives
Sing it now

Making my way through life
Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious past what do we have
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle, and became a man

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything, (Yeah)
On top of the world
I'ma hold y'all down for real, (Gotcha!)

It was 1996, fourth of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds,
Seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
Three oh five, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We on the go, yelling at the cabbie, cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Hear come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do see-sections
But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

My baby girl

June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least
That's what the midwife said, on the phone
Anyway, the music got me going away
Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore
Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy,
When they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel

So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

I do it for the seeds y'all,
In they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all
I give them the truth,
So they approach the situation, with ammunition
I keep nothing away,
They hear everything, cause they know how to listen
Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow
And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition
They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart,
It's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to them
Unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl,
Everyday they bring joy to my world

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real

YOu must be smoking like the spliff we like to light when we build
Out of respect for the dead we let our Heinekens spill
Cats taking Vicatin pills to numb the pain that they feeling
Pertaining to stealing my rhymes finding their brains on the ceiling
I'm blowing their minds wide open when I'm flowing I'm fine
Hey yo my whole style banging like I'm throwing up signs
Niggas get cut like I saw someone I know in the line
I live life to the fullest cause I know I could die
Right now, I don't believe I know when to sto'
My face soldier's going to lie, when I'm going to buy
You gonna see a rainbow in the sky
And my momma's face glowing with pride
My first born held it down and through my baby's soul I survive
Put your hands in the air and let me know you're alive
I love this game y'all, I ain't even going to lie
I can see you all rocking cause you know when it's live, word

Look up in the sky recongnize it's sunshine
Yeah, what you gonna do when we come through when you
How can you deny when it's right in your eyes
Shock body, ro-ro-ro-ro-rock body

I want you, 'cause you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to, when pain confronts you
You're everything, sometimes I get nervous when I'm in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do, I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you blackout and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through 
And make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, you send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music will start I want you to be the muse of my art
When people try to rip us apart we got to work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want not what I need there's a difference
These days I'm learning that words got power so I'ma be specific

Can I have a talk with you?
Can I make a dream come true?
Can I be in love with you?

Hold on to something, hold on to something
We about to take the road less travelled
You ain't gotta go home, but you can't stay here
Let's go

I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake til you come and make things right (yeah yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away (come on)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight? (yeah)

Check it out
There's this lady I'm in love with (yes there is)
Living inside this woman unknown
But she's scared to let it show
I know it sound like some bug shit (yeah it do)
It's just she come with
Hang-ups and
Insecurities they gotta go
She always nervous around me
But see this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight
And ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at
In our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her ""what's wrong with dat?"" (what's wrong with dat?)
She like ""it just ain't right
There's so many more women and men in the world""
I have to admit the girl got a point (true)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something I just can't have
So now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love
I just stay focused
And true to my path

I got to get away
Ladies you ever felt growing away
By your man
Asking ""baby, won't you stay?""
He chilling with his crew
He should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues
Cause the children to glue
He willing to do
Whatever it takes
To save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies
Raise they children theyself
You're so busy trying to save 'em
That you you're killing yourself
With the
Stress and strife
And the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night
Who can't run they own life
Up in your air
Nothing is fair
Why do you care?
Why do you always take it there?
The crying, the tears
You ain't prepared for the jewels
That I'm trying to share
Flying there
Dying inside
Hot in the fear
The writing is clear
On the wall
For you to read the sign
Ayo the fine is the way we design
To be fine
But still

I get lonelier each time (i get so lonely)
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake til you come and make things right
(mmm make it right, make it right, make it right)
I get lonelier each time you go away (la la la la la la la la)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?

Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go

Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go

You can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather
They treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever
You got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time
We got to live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning
When they waking up
This music got me out late but
I holla at you when I'm done
Don't stay up
Will love play with us?
It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol
But if it's real
They ain't no greater rush
I got faith in us
It's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people
And still feel lonely

(I don't care)

Hah,yeah, I'm at the crib, man, chillin'
With Whip and my nigga Talib, we just chillin'
It's like that, you know how it is, we just chillin'
And I get the paper so
(I don't care)

MC and ma, people call me Whip
I'm just chillin' all alone, no one to be with, man
I took long but I'm finally here
The most anticipated chick of the year, cheaugh

I came to flip and reverse game
Every dude that I touch get whipped like my first name
And although I'm prissy, don't get it confused
I don't need to mess with you, I've got plenty of dudes

Got the caramel skin, on the parallel twin
Heads keep turnin' like a carousel spins
I know for a fact, these women are sick
'Cause these hoes can't mess with this Dominican chick

Got the flag on my arm, it proves I am the bomb
All I do is speak Spanish and it works like a charm
I been ready, 'cause I payed my dues
Yo, this goes out to my Brooklyn crew

I don't care
Yo

You might catch me on the train, okay, I'm just, chillin'
I ain't too big for the game, I'm just chillin'
I got the whole Red Hook with me chillin'
Roll through if you want 'cause
(I don't care)

Yo, Def Squad got the girl and now I'm just chillin'
I'm on the block, real tough, just chillin'
Y'all non-rappin' chicks can keep chillin'
Talk if you want 'cause
(I don't care)

Ayo, E is chillin', Kwe is chillin'
Whip in the house, Brooklyn in the buildin'
Blood on the dance floor, sweat on the ceilin'
When you get that feelin' that gun concealin' is a hobby

Nobody stealin' shows like Kweli
Workin' on a new project while you chillin' in the lobby
Keep it thorough, ain't real, guns don't kill
People kill people but the Sun don't chill

But still, I stand cooler than a Minnesota winter
Nigga, hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners
Plus, all the sinners got dreams they runnin' after
Workin' a 9 to 5 now, is like you hustlin' backwards

That's why all these young girls in love with the rappers
Basketball players and up-and-comin' actors
Swimmin' with the sharks and flirtin' with disaster
When the things you own start ownin' you, they your master

Yeah
I don't care

I got the yak in the back of the club, I'm just chillin'
With Whip and my nigga E Dub, we just chillin'
Nobody give a fuck about you, we chillin'
But I smack the shit out you, like
(I don't care)

So if you really wanna know how it is, I'm just chillin'
Like audio, tune milk and kids, we chillin'
Material things that we shit, I'm just chillin'
You brag about what you got but

It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Ohh, best believe a better world

[Talib Kweli--talking over chorus]
Yes, ladies and gentleman
You do have Kenn Starr in the house, Asheru
Talib Kweli...

[Kenn Starr]
If it wasn't for the way that we live
Too many single mothers raisin' our kids
Too many brothers caged in the Pen
Engagin' a bid, enslaved by the pigs

If it wasn't for crooked cops that pop shots grazin' our wig
That sends slugs reckless, plus these thugs with a death wish
That take your life for the ice that flood in your necklace
The blood of the helpless and innocent (and innocent)

If it wasn't for so-called friends that turned Benedict
Snakes in the grass and crabs in the lake
'Cause I'm black and its late, getting' harassed by the Jake
Blasted with eight times five, plus one

Lethal deposit, reach for your wallet, they bust guns
That's why I trust none and I keep to myself
I can't blame cats that pack heat in they belt
And quick to clap, never givin' in

If it wasn't for this and that
It'd be a better world that we livin' in

[Hook: x 2]

[Asheru]
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
Nowadays you can't live that way
The markets way too unstable, there's too many pimp labels
Playing rappers like a ho, manhandlin' the dough

Demandin' them to go on a track to bring the loot back
Now you playing for the team and the captain, that's cream
You got the dream to push a mean two-seater
With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one

You make the songs, but labels only want the hot ones
Send you back to the drawing board, until you got some
Now I guess we got problems
Even your all-creative mind ain't enough to try and solve 'em

The doors revolvin', younger cats are starvin'
They want it more than you, might go to war with you
To reap the heap of dough that's at the end of the rainbow
You can't be mad, man, that's how the game go

[Hook: x 2]

[Talib Kweli]

(yeah, see'mon!)
(yea, here we go, yeah!)

I'm about to show you what this black power is
Red, black, and green on the wrist how I live
In the cold world where we bust off the black llamas
Every winter where we lose more son to black mommas

If hip-hop got seasons, right now its spring
Like when everybody selling death, ""kiss the ring"" (yeah!)
You know how it goes, people change color like autumn
Kids learn through experience, fuck what a teacher taught 'em

Puff a relief for boredom; rough will release a quarter
And the parents who paid enough attention to at least ignore 'em
Blowing up mics, throwin' up signs
To help niggaz you confusin' it with cryin'

The winners write the history books
Mystery looks past prisoners of war, that's what my listeners are for
Turn the tide on this fuckery, ride on this fuckery
You should a never let me in the industry, you're stuck with me

You be a jack of all trades and a master of none
Mood Swinging

La la la la la... eh oooo oo X4

Soon come you will understand
The motivation of a man getting the under hand
A local yokel on a mission to get global
Lettin' my vocals amass to some total
And keep the point focal, you hear me but you don't listen
You think its easy being put in this position
I freak speech, but still don't want to preach
This peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees
Grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn
The activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment
So I leading a community movement
And I don't need money for me to make a community improvement
Tell me what you stand for
Would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more
Only time will tell, what this new world brings
Revolutions at order, check the mood swing, swing
Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

Low like sweet chariot
What I say make my voice deep as berries get
Carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry 'em off
Have a divorce if the track is whack
(Please) My rhymes a rolling stone
Home is where the high hatters at, its on this song
(it on this song) Maybe one day it'll settle down
It ain't no good it all better now, come on let it now

Mood swing, changing the way we do things
It's a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing

Me and baby in the rental
She talkin' gentle hit the hotel to presidential
Sweet...kisses on the temple make her feel special
Light a candle scent got us in this sentimental
Move it's right wit the light just so I could see
Begin to set the pace for what we gon' get into
My fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental...
Ancient secrets, Indian, and Oriental
Blackin' out doin' shit that I can't rap about
Passin' out, wakin' up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not stop
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin' late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
But damn baby ""You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine""

Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
The great pretender wit a whole different agenda
Until I make it big ""Life is one long gig""
Mood swing like Ella of cold train its classic
Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
So all of why'all that wagging they campaign
Grab a hold of that mood swing and do the damn thing

I'm an outlet
A front of which which you ain't figured out yet
A resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course
It seats ya, doin' whatever it takes ta reach ya
All of its in me, no really its in me
A good brother, lovin' son, a great lover
I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an emcee for all of the world to see
Yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
That we rep shit, its the least to be expected
Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
From the same minds saying the same things at the same time
Back stage rappin' like gettin' ready for game time
We a family, and ain't nothing goin' to change that
For better or worse like somebody prearrange that
The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
That's when our nation will rise and realize that 

Life without knowledge is death in disguise

The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

Mood swing, yea 
See change is good sometimes 
Mood swing, yea

It's time to mood swing

And Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth (true) the brothers who brought ya
Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah, right about now we about to make history

The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggas don't sell crack 'cause they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
'Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the fetal
I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix Coke with the Henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denys
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'
The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this, you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with quarters and keys just like a leachious mind
I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine
If you ready to roll than we can rock shit
A nigga so cold he hot

Pete Rock murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through and upgrade that cash

Better master your eye 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

Go get your hate up get your weight up I'm tellin' you straight up
You need to turn that frown upside down you use less muscles
The smile is easier than it sound, it's true
Lookin' all crooked I tell these dudes
They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiendin' 'ore the camera screaming, just shoot me
We 93 million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we practice the way of the gun
Like Taye Diggs raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state
Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggas buggin' me I need a fuckin' pesticide

Son we keepin' it fly how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

You put light back to life 'cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, you have to fight
Battle right through the afterlife
'Cause when you die make you look way past the light
And hind sight I drop the type of rhyme
To give the blind sight, sparkle a shine bright like lemon lime
Sprite up in the limelight, yeah
As we still at the track you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet official would kill it
This is fake the way we seal it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got heat to make your chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggas sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black
I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at

Soon rap come through a crossroads, and all these lost souls
Will send out distress signals like Morse code

I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal

Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back

For surviving through every lie they put into us now
The world is yours and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

My mama said life would be so hard
Growin' up days as a black girl scarred

Talib Kweli,"This the story of lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town
She gotta get to new york and watch a door fall down
Hopped off the greyhound, gotta make her way now
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little lucy wild
She quick to hop up on his dick straight hoopie style
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it
She looking for love in all of the above
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug
Who wanna put it in her, withdraw like a citi card
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar

Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air
Try to hold back your tears baby!
Wait a second, what happens here baby?
Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do)
Yeah! wait a second (one! two! three! c'mon!)

Dreams shattered like broken glass
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast
You complain for the life you supposed to have
But when you try to make plans, god is known to laugh
Throw a song on the phonograph, and lucy start wilin
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying
The gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush
Time's up, she's about to turn 33
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery
Now cats are used to drive past her like a church van
Acting on thirst, 'she wants to move' like a n.e.r.d. fan
Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain

Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air
Try to hold back your tears baby!
Wait a second, what happens here baby?
Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do)
Yeah! wait a second (one! two! three! c'mon!)

She was a small city girl with big city dreams
Niggas try to figure how to get up in them jeans
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love
Really like huey lewis looking for a new drug
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion
Not catching the bus, but back at the station
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'get by'
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name
She need a ticket home if it's the right course
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse

Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air
Try to hold back your tears baby!
Wait a second, what happens here baby?
Broken glass everywhere!
Louder than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah

Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

If lyrics sold, then truth be told
I'd probably be just as rich and famous as Jay-Z
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor

Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way

I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day

You say you never scared there's kids in other countries
Making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they're busy building homes they can't afford to buy
Cars they can't afford to drive
Working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming Gangsta Gangsta all that talk is trife
You already know lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun
Now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone
Losing arms for crying while they mining
Probably an orphan who's momma died of AIDS
He built a coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that
Terrorize you like a cowardly act

The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today

I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Run by the river, only stoppin' to pray chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to run, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2004 we selling raw
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for
I want more, yo

This the first time that I've ever considered wedding rings

There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals, stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and I'll fly make you testify

I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
Because I never been in love before

You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Don't get it confused I'm trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go

So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
I'm never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to R.I.P. Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know

But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?

You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy

Pulled up in Mtulu's truck I'm suited up I'm cool as fuck
Security tripping on my baseball hat promoter knew what's up
Plus Chaps had on some denim shorts and white tee shirt and
I told the bouncer they being disrespectful 'cause like you we working
I ain't a custy or a patron and trust me no one would be paying
To come in this crusty ass club if I wasn't playing
He's like ""I'll put you the fuck out""
And when you put your word like that its like third strike black you struck out
His man tried to rush me from behind Chaps stuck out a size nine
Seen him trip face first into the line
Cats is cowards with no spine and they power tripping too
The next level is the violence so what why'all niggaz want to

[Chorus:]
Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out 
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what why'all ladies want to do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out

People placed in situations they can't take and what they facing
Is the trials and tribulations to make them say the Lord's forsaken them
Their loved ones intervening but they always blaming them
For problems they don't realize what they part is in creating them
Like men who so insecure think they women cheating on them
And women who think the proof that they man love them is they beating on them
Keep sleeping on them soon they partner creeping on them
Committing crimes of passion they in caskets mother weeping on them
With her head in her hands
There's only one thing that the dead understand that it's better to be alive
Now what you gonna do stick your head in the sand
You probably the type to fall for anything and take that instead of a stand
Now that's a mouse instead of a man
I cherish my role as the head of my fam
And on the road I meet incredible fans
I rock with singers an a DJ instead of a band we at a theatre near you
So what why'all niggaz want to do

[Chorus:]

Stay civilized when they try to kill my high I try to think through problems
Bring honesty to rap like Cam'ron brought the pink to Harlem
You could be on the brink to stardom and suddenly you sink to bottom
Tell the truth about the war and suddenly you linked Saddam
Hate the topic but the closet people get to patriotic
Is red bull white vodka mixed with the straight hypnotic
Paper prophets sell the revolution so they make a profit
Trust they got it fucked up with your taxes started making rockets
Take it off the top like politicians speaking proper diction
Stuffing dollars in they britches like they do a lotta stripping
Got the top position bitching about the quality of life
All that bullshit get exposed as soon as Kweli sees the mic
They cutting down the tree of life the sun rays is running out
The babies ain't eating right so the guns keep coming out
See how they play the streets an night slap the taste out your mouth
To show you what they work about
So what why'all niggaz want to do

[Chorus:]",Work It Out,2004

All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)

N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hell, a problems
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you feel me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, or to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful but this
Bastard's flow will bash a skull and I will
Cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we assholes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cause we don't want to here that weak shit no mo'

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)

Now now now now now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26, tellin' me that she 36-26,
Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E
At NYU but she hail from Kansas,
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes but
Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it

Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
With real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)

Talib Kweli,"I'm from a place
Where you gotta let yo' nutz hang
Where them crakas used to cut your stomach open
Just to let your fuckin' guts hang

Right there in front of the kids
I might as well split your wig
'Cause that's just what the master did

But now I'm the new Nat Turner
Spreadin' something to the kids
Like Sojourner, man, the truth

Fuck a 'Creek, I care
But you in doubts and go ""Woof""
He ain't dead, what pledge
There's a stank up in the Bush

Or a stank up in the White House
Shootin' board bullshit, man, it's dead props
Here in Chicago but hit this hi-lo
Warriors come play, click the bottles

Cock them AK's, bust on KK's
With the knuckle boy or the other two and the Stic-Man
Given dead on your shirt like a wristband
You a grown man, nigga, stand tall

Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

Yo, niggas is not original
Niggas follow the radio
Niggas think if you blow
Then you gotta be on the TV show

Crackas is hypocritical
Crackas will rob and shit on you
'Cause see you do what they do
They know freedom is powerful

Niggas is very visual
If we see it, we think it's true
Very few niggas make a move
And even less'll see it through

Crackas make up the chemicals
Then they call us the criminals
Crackas make all the loot
And we just get the residuals

Niggas will rob and shoot on you
Crackas will drop a bomb on you
Niggas is having funerals
Crackas is having barbecues

Niggas sing the blues
That's reminicin' the spiritual
But when you say gawd is you
Niggas ain't really hearing you

Crackas like to capitalize
Them crackas a lie
They say if you don't unionize
Then you'll probably die

I hate callin' niggas, niggas
So I'ma take it backwards
But I got now love for Whithey
I love callin 'em crackas

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long a walk, now that we ridin'

Yeah, I call myself real N I G G A
'Cause Kweli be showin' on the floor
And they policies, my philosophies
Show you that the block is a part of me

Freedom fighter like Richard Carter be
It's deep how the street knowledge beef
'Cause it ran like a code inside of me
It's practical, not scholarly

Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me
Who's got my back when the cops harass me
New York, L.A or Cincinnati
Can ride the train or with the Caddie

When they call you, nigga they scared of you
They fearin' you so actually
If crack is gone, be fearing niggas
Then that's what the fuck I have to be now

It's a badge of honor
And some say that shit's absurd
It's more than just a word
We flip the shit like it's a bird

Pass it down through generations
Then cuss you out and say it loud
The first generation of muthafuckas
To grab our nuts and say it proud

Country niggas or city niggas
Tupac niggas or biggie niggas
In the corridor, floor or door
And all my Mississippi niggas

We connected all throughout
The north, the east, the west, the south
And if a white boy say the shit
He'll still get punched right in the mouth

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

All they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

You see, all they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

Ghet-to p-pole it's time to ride (Supreme, Supreme)
Bay-be	 get involved go side to side (Supreme, Supreme, Yeah, Yeah)
Side to side... 
[Verse 1] {Talib Kweli}
'Bout to slap box with the beat
The shit I spit is a snapshot of the street
You can see the crack spot in the backdrop
The heat in the stash box of the black drop
You wonder why there's more crime
Free food, or a check the only time niggaz on line
Getting information from the nigga-net
The trickle-down theory guess it ain't reached niggaz yet
I make a bigger bet
Kweli 'bout to be a bigger threat
'cause there's hardly any real niggaz left 
What the fuck these niggaz talking 'bout
Living a movie but the audience is walking out
I fight the temptation to rip the heart from your chest
'Til there's only five hard beats left
It's like a dead man walking
I turn on the radio and I hear dead men talking

Ghet-to p-pole it's time to ride (Supreme, Supreme)

[Verse 2] {Mos Def}
Yo'
I got my headphones up like I'm listening close
Face blank with expression it isn't a joke
Start fire, sit back and spit its smoke
To get it provoked, blow it back to get in your throat
Mad problems...Take all the niggaz you know
Add that number up with every nigga you don't
Final number, some total of the niggaz that won't
Break me down, shake me of my fame, my style
What time it is, crew you can hate me now
And ten minutes from then you gon' love me again
Buck town republic again
Writing on the wall trouble again
Intensify struggle and such
Killers, Sad lovers deluxe
Sound garnered, for the wild hearted
Downtrodden, up-starters
Young violent, uprising
Cocaine, and gunpowder
Up north, or bus crowded
Daily vibes to thug mountain
Cold caves or peaks of high
Think you present but unclear, and know how to hide
If you wonder why you got so much on your mind
'cause your living in a troubling time, this is a puzzling time
Fall back without recovering time, and time's up
Brooklyn, put your dimes up

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3] {Mos Def + Talib Kweli}

{Mos Def}
I put feeling inside of my rap
Hold it down for my side of the map
No matter what north, south east or west side of the mat
Bend a needle on the mind and it's back

{Talib Kweli}
Got a problem with that?
The holler back and the stars is black
We the New Era you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist in tact
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that

{Mos Def}
Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think
Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink
You a vessel that's promised to sink
Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

{Talib Kweli}
Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who
Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food
I take a bite out the track like a Sabre-tooth
And spit out the truth
'Til the cops come and spray the booth

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro] {Talib Kweli + Mos Def}
Its all right with you its all right with me 
Do the damn thing what you wanna be (Supreme, Supreme)
That's right, that's right that's right that's right 
That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme)

You ain't special, there's a million rappers like you
Far from clumsy, but I drop lines and spill bars

It's sick how I'm addicted to mics, become a flickerin' light

Where I'm from, they be watchin' us, but we be watchin' them

Leavin' the floor
Cause my words cut deeper than a tissue massage

I'm on mission for God he blessed me to spit it this hard
A lot of niggas start shit but they don't finish the job
I'm like Minister Farrakhan or Africans who finished a marathon
The pain in my voice is like Sarah Vaughn
No matter what playin' 'em on I carry on
Even if the dawn lit overhead I carry on
Like Flash Gordon the Scar on my Face is Brad Jordan
Passports splash with blood from the battle I last fought in
I want to cash all in

I'm lookin' through the club I'm really searchin' for who's sane
The music got everyone crazy and who to blame
Be prepared think there'll be some ugliness up in here
End up in intensive care with the vegetables there, you know?

Gettin' it wet without bustin' a sweat
Swingin' for the upper deck
It's the black man cuttin' a check
The nigger's the boss
The niggers want to test if they addicted to laws
I spit on the floor
The right hook will get at your jaw
Make the track my baby mama when I'm hittin' it raw
I rap through:
Wars and tours and whores on the floors I did it for force
So I spit at all the shit that I saw
I party with supermodels who wanna take of they clothes
The ones who smokin' cocaine so they don't fuck up they nose
I walked the slums of Soweto and the streets of Havana
Takin' pictures with kids who never seen a camera
From the land of the Alabama since the night in the Cali
Bumpin' gangster music like a freedoms song in the rally
Out the back of yo' Dinnali give you the skinny like Ally McBeal
It's the black steel, Brooklyn know the deal, what?!

How cats is stuck in purgatory for life 
Tryin' to fight the enemy without sight 
They in the dark swingin' right to left 
Clingin' to the little bit of light that's left 
And can't escape the room, you can't escape the tomb 
You all wear a mask sometimes, I can relate to Doom 
That make the whole world earthquake, shake, and move 
The beat create a mood or eat your whole plate of food 
You can't come close like an order of protection 
That this is myself in the pack was sort of my intention 
Slaughter anybody testin' my callin', my profession 
Anymore questions will born 'em a lesson 
A demonstration of takin' it all the way home 
While you stuck at first base and 
It's like havin' relations without the penetration 
Basically doin' nathin' 
You a waste of space and time 
Always chasin' mine is how you lost your place in line

Evaporate an ice grill, read the seeds of Aesop fable 
Children, come sit, gather 
Face the rapid fire of the super slap shit outta liar

Villain, the champ tramp 
Flowin' since they had him holdin' 
He cleaned his mask with a shoe mitt 
And a little bit of her blue spit 
She told him you so stupid 
Wiped it off, got dressed and left 
Everybody instigatin', not just the ref 
We can shoot the fire on the dirt ground 
Rocks out live with the worst sound 
First round knock out

Yo I'm brooklyn like the 90s
Brown villa pusha, keep it grimy
Without the flapbush, thats where you found me
In brooklyn tec with just an incidaite? Free ??
Always catch me with Juju and Rubic and even truer kids
Dollar van ??, john bow running, never look back 
Just the man that kept the hammer in his back
Rubics interduced me to Black and Forte
Dj Enough on avenue Kay I go back a long way, 
With supernet and watching square and freestyling every day 
Performing at Lyricist Lounge, ate of the g-brake?
Fuckin with mooders how I met Hi-Tek 
Blackstar came in effect, when Alycia gave a tape to Mos def 
Reflection Eternal was next on deck, 
My crew the best and we prooved it. 
We knew our music was the vanguard of a movement 
Every Rawkus release was banging
They on the come up, 
They was like fuck the radio to pharrel state, get the fuck up
Black listen, Jaron and Bryant
Next position was right about now, we need the radiohead ridging me, 
While I hit the road on tour to support the record since the day it was sold
Corey had me following the example of De la Soul
Common and the Rooster, and me, these the sickest niggaz
Get my figures with the Okay-players and the Spitkickers
Rawkus got a deal with MCA, thats the grey area
But let us come from music cemetery of America
They try to fool you by switching the name to Geffen 
Now they interscopes bitch and every artist who had a chance left â€˜em
Ain't no big surprise, wasn't no love there, Jimmy Ivy never signed me
I just kinda ended up there, fuck that 
Literaly, it was my way or the highway 
Hit the road with the Beasty Boys on tour Europe with Kayne
I gotta thank him for the love on the album
I knew out on Electric Circus he get it by any means necessary, like Malcolm
I tried a single shot at video, getting control of my situation 
Gotta label pop in this assituation??

I blow the back out the track when I black out
Got the spot maxed out, people in the front pass out
Security carry that ass out
Get in the zone when I'm stoned like I live in a glass house
Last bout I was in started to get real serious
Homeboy got dropped and spazzed out like mysterious
The boy in the hood with the furious style
We in the age of Aquarius now, yo
I show pain in the manner of Coltrane's ""Alabama""

I had a big death but I missed my appointment
Y'all walkin' through the valley while I run through it
Every party we come through makin the ""Gun Music""
Practice the (Art of War), don't make me Sun Tzu it
I put them knots in yo' head 'til you can't undo it
You can't unscrew it, ladies wanna take it off
All they want is piece of mind so I break 'em off

Cops don't protect us, protestors just get ignored B
Played out like musical theater with best support
The investors and bankers havin sex in expensive orgies

The revelation like sight for the blind like when God cypher divine
hand you lessons, or when you in the church havin' confession
Or when you kneelin' on the pew, catchin' the Holy Ghost
Or the cult, so fanatic they think suicide's the only hope (no)
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after

Talk the talk but to walk the walk is costly
Niggaz got on they +Game+ face like Black Wall Street
Every single move I make is ballsy
Cause the shit it used to be a, silent movie now it's a talky
The Feds cheesin' like Milwaukee when shit is Brew-in
When these niggaz stage a coup for the president I'm a shoo-in
But, ain't no political aspirations I'm persuin'
I hate to ruin your dream but music is what I'm doin'
I've touched more people in a verse than you do in 20 speeches
Whether state's blue like the water or redder than white people on sunny beaches
Sometimes I don't be understandin' it
They looked at me and said that's why you the perfect candidate
Standin' at the pulpit with a full clip
What I say real talk, turn around and walk away with your bullshit
I'm like breed, yo I ain't to be fucked with
Only write the realest, can't lie to the public

The sharp wick cut quick, killin 'em softly
They try to take me there but you could never force me

Add that number up with every nigga you don't
Final number, some total of the niggas that won't
Break me down, shake me of my fame, my style
What time it is, crew you can hate me now
And ten minutes from then you gon' love me again
Buck town republic again
Writing on the wall trouble again
Intensify struggle and such
Killers, Sade lovers deluxe
Sound garnered, for the wild hearted
Downtrodden, up-starters
Young violent, uprising
Cocaine, and gunpowder
Up north, or bus crowded
Daily vibes to thug mountain
Cold caves or peaks of high
Think you present but unclear, and know how to hide
If you wonder why you got so much on your mind
'Cause your living in a troubling time, this is a puzzling time
Fall back without recovering time, and time's up
Brooklyn, put your dimes up

[Chorus: x2]

I put feeling inside of my rap
Hold it down for my side of the map
No matter what north, south east or west side of the mat
Bend a needle on the mind and it's back

Got a problem with that?
The holler back and the stars is black
We the New Era you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist in tact
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that

Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think
Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink
You a vessel that's promised to sink
Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who
Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food
I take a bite out the track like a Sabre-tooth
And spit out the truth
'Til the cops come and spray the booth

[Chorus: x2]

Its all right with you its all right with me
Do the damn thing what you wanna be(Supreme, Supreme)
That's right, that's right that's right that's right
That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme)

Its all right with you its all right with me

They wanna know (All you have to do) 
Know how I do 
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me, call me) 
Why you playing, why you playing? 
I be going like two and two 
With some hot shit ready to spit for you 
With the songs that you love just to get you through 

Back in effect 
I'm back to collect 
Got the respect 
Which will turn into the cash or a check 
You can, pay me in fear, you can pay me with love 
You can, pay me in tears or you can pay me in blood 
Spray me with slugs, and the revolution live, I never die in vain 
The writer might be dead but the piece remain on the train (yea) 
The music help you be true to yourself, accumulate wealth 
So what I spit is the embodiment I do for self 
As a teen it was kinda hard to find a job 
I took over my writer's bloc and ran it like a spot 
I'm Pimp see in this game nigga, I'm a hard 
But I'm never feasting on it, keep speaking on it God 
That's what they say when I'm building, I keep my dialogue street 
But still spiritual like we deep inside a mosque 
Or the sin of God that don't preach or go where the sinners are 
And keep the fire burning like a slum lord in the Bronx 

[Chorus] 

Rhyme writer from nine to five 
It's the 25 to lifers with the balance of the acrobatic high wires 
The pain of the slave with his back feeling like fire 
Cause the whip talking to his ass like Knight Rider 
Most of these rappers now days be sounding like liars 
Got visions of guns in they head like the Pied Piper 
When I bust they start to disappear like my lighters 
Cause they shit is faker than the dreads on Mikah Phifer 
The industry is in trouble 
Plus these industry niggaz is fake, so they tend to be in a bubble 
So I hit the block where they're known to thicken the plot 
Sticking up cops, kids be pocket-picking they Glocks (my man) 
Balling outta control, don't be forgetting that niggaz is broker than dishes at a Greek wedding 
They might try to run up on you, take your life quick 
It's like this when you walk the strip up on the night shift 

[Chorus] 

This right here the bare essentials with no extras y'all 
I kept it raw from the school of thought where less is more 
Brooklyn is cooking and I blessed it with the special sauce 
I got the soul of a prophet and never take a loss 
Fresher than kicks out the box, the kids on the block 
That is street hungry trying to get that sweet honey out the rock 
Crack in the socks when they click the row thicker than sour sop 
Listening to my black power rock 
Music, of this hip hop we be rock to it 
I'm a river, you a valley, watch me run right through it 
You wanna learn how to do it, tell the truth in your single first 
Lil' Kim went to jail for what you do in every single verse (free Lil' Kim) 
Lyrics is perjury, your beats is more plastic than surgery 
And we in the United States of emergency 
One of the main reasons none of you lames worry me 
Is I change lanes like I change planes and change currency

Niggaz fight your way through
If you're not ready to lose may I suggest that you let us the fuck through
Everybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down
Dance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know
Hands in the air, knees in, knees out
Drop a little symbol on them this time, no doubt, let's go
I write ten years deep and tenure's still deep
My bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat
I meant for the decades almost passed and spaceball was the least
And I'm struggling still hustle to eat
I must be built with Adam and Eve skin
While y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in
With your heart poking through on your arm stupid
Drop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed
My mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin'
Didn't need to get loud, no disrepect
But you know the Jean is threat to your checks
Niggas heart burning no prowl though sec to stop the attack
Ya neck back's gettin hot on every drop on the track
And now I finally got some heat is good, let it be known
I'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone
Can't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya
To quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up

What get the sack, eyes low like Friskin' cat
My flow get cap throw they gun like official Nas
I'm draftin' you niggas hard quick fast like tiptonat
Diamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass
Your mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash
Screaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay
Niggas rappin' black and white and rappers shakin' Jean Grae
Sick of niggas licking boots I pick 
And choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot
Let the pride and move the cattle
Y'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal
You baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me
Me? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey
Like magazines telling lies and Star Wars like Dick Chaney
It sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters
When I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda

Where you gonna run

Where you gonna hide
Where you gonna run
Where you gonna run
Yeah come on, yeah come on

She lacks delivery, really, nigga I pack rap symmetry and send it to ya dorm
Why y'all iggin' me for sure
Jean is synonymous to chivalry
Open doors but I step through first
Test the waters and I pee in them got no network
But now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead
Only led I strapped with a razor sharp pencil 
That could write but it could stab you rapid
It's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors
What tho?, come on let's race to where the cash is
Get mauled like Roy the alter boy
I'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed
You still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level
You face screwed ugly
I'm chasing all you club bunnies
And racing you tackle you down
Take your money with your chest on the ground
I know it's foul, what you gonna do now

Survive like a Cuban holdin' piece of wood floatin' to Miami
Like, Elian Gonzalez cause they back with the family
Survivin' in the streets of Brooklyn, that's where you find me
Survivin' like somebody mommy clutchin' a palm tree in a tsunami
Who woulda thunk that would ever happen?
Rootin' for Kweli cause he brung back clever rappin'
Sister, heads wrapped in fabric of the standard music
Chicks, with their tits, made of plastic look, dancin' to it
In this arena I balance, your boy stand-alone
And win it cause these rappers is more annoying than camera phones
Maybe it's me, it could be hard to move me

It's hot ones like shotguns from the passenger seat
The mic booth, the district where they be packin' the meat

Back on the street like an ex-con
With enough in his pocket for a tip at a restaurant
It's a cold world, dress warm
Cuttin' through the bullshit record labels and the shady deals
Ladies feel the beat when they out clubbin' like baby seals
Let me chill out cause the raw image to focus on
Get back to my point, this joint is jumpin' like a circus song
Yeah, to break it down to the basic components

MF Doom, Talib Kweli, ah here we go
On born days, I used to blow out the candles; and every Saturday
Watch cartoons 'til noon and then I'd switch to Ralph McDaniels
I was, makin up a miracle flow, over a cereal bowl
And a paused beat from my stereo
Rhymes stronger than Popeye with the spinach
Yeah I'm gangster like the frog on Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse
Maybe I'm trippin and it's just a cartoon to you
But I got chills when I heard how Doom flipped the Scooby Doo
And, I might be buggin but it seem to me
That cartoons be realer than reality TV
They inspire my decision to be open and listen
But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position
Like, in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past
That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes
Me and my people break bread, sit and smoke
The conversation rich, but that depend on what you consider broke
I draw on anything for inspiration
A fond memory, a piece of paper, walls in a train station

It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that

Walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain, nose runny
Breakdancin maybe ten, bummy
Is when Subroc would run up handspring Arabian somee!
Ooh wee, like a Hong Kong Phooey kick
Or a weekend afternoon, karate movie flick
Slept good, no justice, no peace
Woody kept it hoody, never discussed it with police
Shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat
Or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat
And since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat?
What type of chitlins is that?
The Super Villain as the bat, hide your tonic
Whoever willin to ride, provide raw chronic

Motherfucker somethin's wrong with you
When you cheat just way to smart to question
The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion
The governments of the world is shark infested
They heavy on weaponry like Charelton Heston
Man yeah it gets low here uh, real low
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Chorus]
I ain't rockin' with you, so what what you goin do? (it's my favorite mutiny)
I ain't rockin' with you, you're logic does not compute (it's my favorite mutiny)

[Boots]
Death to the pigs is my basic statement
I spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement
Tryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement
Had a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments
I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum
Tryin' to find psalm number 151
To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode
Alright, put down the bottle and come get the guns
I get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10
They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den
Said at least a track then, seeds & stems
Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm
I'm get my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns
If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems
Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again
The truth I write is so cold, It'd freeze my pen
I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you
Never let they punk ass ever defeat you
They got us on the corner wearin pleather and see through
All y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you
I ain't just fin to rap on the track, I fin to clap on the back
And it's been stackin' to that
Been a hundred years before iceberg ever lean back in the 'lac
Before they told Rosa black in the back
Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack
And Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack
This beat alone should get platinum plaques
I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrack
'Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stack

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
This the guy like Truman C[e1]
Riq, Boots and me
Activate in the community
Up in the bay like Huey P
It's like a free, it remind me of the be	 Kder's love for me
But beats got it twisted, I'll untangle it
Black mind is entwined like the ropes they used to hang us with
This is my favorite shit, I came in the game with any way to spit
Ya got a questionnaire, who you bangin' with?
Take it back to M hotel
Throw a step deeper like a poor righteous teacher with holy intellect
Killer flow form a real niggaz laughin'
And forni fairly at a jigabou at a penitent (???)
Once again you can feel hip-hop
Underground, still about McGruff
Gangsta like, fuck the cops
Talib Kweli revolutionary mc, and that ain't about stuff

",Abra Cadabra,2006
Talib Kweli,"Black man ain't allowed a moment of weakness
The crew ain't got no room for those who flee when the beef hit
Cause they don't want no beef like people who only eat fish
You get the third degree like my society secret
N***ers run so much we spend a grip on them sneakers
I'd rather stand and fight there's no respect for the meek shit
I'm trying to get this cheese like a pizza that's deep dish
The sensitive shit you can keep it.. what I feel

all through the night and for when it's right, as long as it's tight
It'll demand to get performed on the mic
And hopefully become a song that you like, and it probably will
Cause what I spit is what so real, it's based on what I feel
All I did was take a lil moment, homie I'm giving you notice
Last days that they predicted upon us
N***ers stick it to be sitting on corners, n***ers do what you will
It's your life, it really don't matter what I feel

[chorus]

when I pick up the mic, and spit what I write 
Go and sign myself so I can give you a sight
Into this tunnel of this court doing quarter to life
Until the end you finally see the light
What I feel
Don't matter trying to get what you need
When you gotta cut yourself just to see if you bleed
You need the pain in your life,
Without the pain you can't tell if it's real
It's a hell of a deal
This is what I feel
[/chorous]

all throughout my heart and my soul
Affect my memory like an actor before the start of a role
I represent my community and part of a whole
Pop your balloon mindstate, it make it harder to blow
You in the front row trying to diss, you make it part of the show
The right fist will make you part of the flow
No question I'm the answer for this, 
I'm harder than a n***er with a cancerous prostate tryin to pimp 
I got the real version of lyrics that you tryin to kick
Yeah I'm crossing n***ers out, like what I'm writin to spit
But on the flip son, everything I'm writing is hits
Like the stick of green canabis that we twist then we stick to our lips
End your career with a flick of my wrist, death stroke with the pen
Then I'm flipping the bitch
Do what I want, whenever I want, never gunna front
Give it to you whether you want it or not 

[chorous]

everybody's a critic, people be hating even talking under their breath
They got me hotter than mating season
This hater nation but the nature of the hate is changing
Like the government deciding who's our faviorite nation
You know it ain't them hations
Or anybody we call terrorist, even if the world hate americans
Our foreign policy destroy they country properly, we demostrate our power
To stimulate our economy
New york is my city
Sort of like vice city
Up all night, to to sky, pink like white titties
Making the classic rthym, I'm having visions
And when I attack the track you get dwarfed like sado-masichism
Send the voice of activism now n***ers ain't eating like Gandhi
Defeating the british with pacifism
And the people love it, see what I mean haters
I got my love like radio rahim

Why Malcolm get killed by the N.O.I.? 
I'm yellow but I'm dark for real 
And why nobody flip when Martin was killed? 
Why Mandela did all them years 
All that blood, all that sweat, and all them tears? 
And I can name thousands more 
That died in the struggle from Mr. Wallace to Mr. Shakur 
That's why I stay influenced to ""Kick in the Door"" 
Bring the White House dudes around the blacks that's poor 
Notice that it's ""unity"" in ""opportunity"" 
Make a lil' cash, now the block is screwin me 
Brand new E-Class, cops pursuin me 
Guess they wanna see me park it 
Lookin at my gun, they wanna see me spark it

Still tryin to fill the void of Biggie and Tupac 
We on them avenues with the red and the blue tops 
Dudes hot to shoot cops from the rooftops 
Too many snitch niggaz TESTIFY 
Warrior kings sent to the bing and left to die 
Girls confuse sex with love so they extra dry 
And got birth control stuck to they necks and thigh 
Whoa, it ain't a game, they want the blacks all killed off 
Our caps all peeled off, nigga this real talk 
What's ill is y'all niggaz still caught up in them battle raps 
There's beef in the hood, +Escaladin+ like Cadillacs 
Monkey on your back livin like a junkie 
Addicted to a dream, wanna die for your country 
Tear down the prison walls, set everyone free 
From freedom fighters to Askari X to Pimp see 

[Chorus] 

[Talib Kweli:] 
Yeah... kids slip in the clip and aim 
For the fortune cause the fame ain't shit to gain 
They get stuck on whips and chains, so freedom slip they brain 
And psychologically that shit's insane 
Now that's crazy, a function of raisin the crack babies 
Sell it back to them cats freebasin back in the 80's 
(C'mon) Disco shit, nigga cock the toast 
Hi-Tek on the track and we rock with the Ghost 

[Styles P:] 
Damn right I make gangster music 
But I still spit poetry like Langston Hughes did 
Pressures of the ghetto might make you lose it 
Grab AK's and go and make the news kid 
Might lose control, but not my soul 
Won't sell for the white man to buy me some white gold 
Sell for the black man, to buy me control

that we use to cook chickens

Deliver me from point A to B like livery
Nothin is free, you got to be a hero to save
They got you working like a slave from the crib to the grave
A minimum wage can barely keep a job for a home
A car or a phone, forget about gettin a loan
You starting to moan, your bank account is getting withdrawn
It's pitiful how we becomin slaves to things that we own
They en-slavin the brains with the whips and the chains
End up in the coffin chasing the fortune, chasing the fame
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the night, slave to the day
They hop aboard the Underground Railroad and run away
Pray for the day niggas don't get taken away
For makin a way to stop their baby's stomach aching today

Pay his life for something he didn't do like the missing mice
Listen up, you know growing up I'll tell you something
He won't like you in the deepest of dungeon
Take away from my periods, leave me by myself

Front if you like, I'm movin fast, my life is runnin the lights
I give my son some advice
Eyes on the prize, keep more with the one in your sight
Won't win the gunfight if you brung you a knife
I'm drawin blood from the rock and keep floodin the block
With rhymes that are sharper than the razor that be cuttin the box
For sure I gotta move niggas with rocks in their socks
The prostitutes sellin the shit right in front of the cops
Under the street lamp, walking through the rain until our feet damp
Single moms all line at the office because they need stamps
Your cousin out of jail, he spent his time finding God
With a felony kinda charge it's kinda hard to find a job
He gotta make a decision, the situation he's placed in
As he's gotta get that gainful employment for his probation
Otherwise he's just another part of the scenery
Just because you got out of jail, that don't mean you free

Gotta survive and sustain and that ain't right
And everywhere you go they want to give you a fight
Gotta survive and sustain and that's for sure

Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude,
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview,
I know you into me, so, let me get into you,
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin,
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins,
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven,
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick,
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it,
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue,
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick,
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady,
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know,
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

I'm the shit (Uggh)
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet,
Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet',
But this ain't 'bout that,
From a city where niggas plug like outlets,
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so,
When I go out, niggas always out to get me in the studio,
And I ain't in the mood to flow,
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo,
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie,
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty,
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy,
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...

Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs,
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun,
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb,
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow,
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow

Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles,

It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the streets
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
The people ain't got shoes for they feet or food to eat
So they hurtin' but what's for certain
Is that you can get you some heat
And over beef you laid to rest like you was getting some sleep
Where the little kids get they rendition, you cant get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable living condition, listen
They shoot you over that paper, its just survivalist human nature
That put you out of your misery like youth in Asia
Don't let them fool you we ain't different

Than the youth in Asia, Africa, Europe it's a small world
we truly neighbors,
If they the third world then who the first to get to heaven
I know its hard but who does God choose to go through it worst
Usually it's the prophets asking a cat what really matters
Nowadays its his pockets

[Chorus:]
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out what we after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and Dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today
The nature of the world today
The nature of the world today

[Verse 2:]
Don't nobody talk no more they on text message
Driving and typing not paying attention
Missing they next exit depending on navigation
Never knowing where they going they staying stuck
On one spot they not growing I'm so over crying waiting
And hoping playing the blame game
The game changed me into a
different world like Dwayne Wade
Getting high just to maintain
Take my music like a drug and drop the
Needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweeking off blow
Except it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul
The street slang I be speaking in code
Kicking the door, freaking the flow till they speakers explode
We in control the people know I speak the truth
The power and my roots
Is thicker than sour _ and I'm strongly busting out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell them you love them
While your family living from granny and the kitchen _

[Chorus:]
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out what we after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and Dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today

When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back

Talib Kweli,"Okay
This what it is now a days right
Little noises and whatnot
I got one though
Ready or not

We know that, what we reap we sew , 
but we forget how low , we can go , 
if it gets bad here on earth but if we don't get to heaven its Hell. 

It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Word

Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children then what's the word of the reverend worth
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Waiter it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n trying to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James'
And why did he think it was so vital to remove chapters 
and write his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die but how they know

It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)

I've been to many churches I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my bay self I control my many urges
I used to study my lessons
It was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word
Studied with roster ferries and learned from the dreads that Hell is called Babylon
And that's where them crazy ball heads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs

But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist of Satan
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong it all sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
Is recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time that those who looking for God know to go inside

It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup

Yo, living in mass confusion
Looking for absolution
The gas seducing and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satin
Religion create the vision
Make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make the rules of faith
The true condition and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
We in the third eye of the storm

It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep

They ain't down with no leaders
They don't wanna wait just a minute

They like, ""What? Nigga, wait right there""
I got 'Reservoir Dogs', you'll be missin' a right ear
Get it clear, I figure it's my year
I'm everywhere makin' appearances and niggas might miss

Hear the word, peep the flow, check the cadence
What you heard as a pro, I'm so amazing
Don't front, girl, you know it's ya favorite

The word is bond, shit is real, shit is real
Yo son, this block is dead
Nigga need to go over here and pop off real quick
Yo, I gotta get that guap by all means
You know what I'm sayin', son?

Growin' up in Brooklyn, shit
I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-DMC
So I thought that everybody 'Walked This Way'

We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill
It's just some things I was taught to say
And every Saturday morning
I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes

The puberty came, started hittin' them cuties with game
And the truancy came
Started cuttin' in just class, I was comin' all fast, I was new to game
Used to playin' on TV courtesy of video music box
Plus knew a lot of hustlas, goin' O.T., comin' back with the new hip hop

Like E-40 holding down the yay , N.W.A. in L.A.
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston, they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina

L.A. is little Alabama
They walk and they talk with a country grammar
And you think everybody else sound country
So they started callin' 'em Bamas

Down south where we buy them hammers
Down south where we sell them drugs
Down south where life is cheap
Where they quick to fill you with them slugs

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
Want it simply put? You can't rip me
When I spit for the set, everyone free
I'ma underground king, nigga Pimp see free
Word up to my man Bun be, what?

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
The things you bustin', the game you hustlin', the days you're cuttin'
The flame you cuffin' and the lames you snuffin', your name is nothin'

Growin' up in P.A., I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin' but that county slang, what up, dog? What up, cuzz?
Late night you see us guzzlin' 40's, menthols, wine and weed
Sittin' on the back porch, gettin' zooted, feelin' fine indeed

Listenin' to Eric Band, Rakim or EPMD
Cool see and Steady be, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate

Then along came Geto Boys, Raheem and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
OG style, they cars, ditch that 4 and too much trouble
Our squad is gangsta nigga, put it down for H-Town on the double

So I said it's time to hustle, got down with my brother see
Put together UGK and shit, the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't
Trust me it's nothin', just another day in the life for country cousins

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'

Back in P.A.T., man, we be sippin' the barre
I'm down with J from Houston and I think it should be
But when I'm out in L.A., I fuck with Ice-T

$hort Dog is my OG, we been down forever
Taught me the game, lane to lane, and keep my pimpin' together
Niggaz don't understand by far back in the day
It was 'mazin' and my brother put me up on Black Star

Start as blacks off the news, I weighed
'Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away
My niggaz passed away in an unreal way
They mommas' depleted
I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight

I'm on the Chitalin tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin' on these jealous niggaz in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin', only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole south, I made it just for my hood
The pimpin's good

Get up, go to school with his nose runny
Come home with his nose bloody
His sister laughin', he like, ""What's so funny?""
'Til she drowned out by the sounds of hunger pains in his tummy

Nuttin' in the freezer, nuttin' in the fridge
Couple of 40 ounces but nuttin' for the kids
Little man know they to eat to live
But he don't wanna leave the crib

The kid who punched him in his face
House right down the street from his
He went anyway, more scared to face his moms
She'll beat him soon as she flip out seein' his face scarred

Walkin' past the dope fiends with they smoke to the place of God
Hopes and dreams pourin' out the holes in they face and arms
Little man in the face of harm if he don't eat
He need energy so when he go to school he can compete

And keep up, all he got is bodegas
But hey, he only got enough a for quarter water and a now or later
Anyway, grandma say Jesus'll be here any day
Good, 'cause with nuttin' to eat it's gettin' hard to pray

Do you entrust the critics who doubt you?

Go hungry, you gotta watch what the media feed you
And don't be a poisoned animal, eaten either
It's harder than it sound, 'cause nowadays
Put that swine in everything
The white sugar so addictive, it's pure 'caine

They got pork in the toothpaste, soda in the Sunny D
Jello brand gelatin is laced with the lecatin
In Africa, they starvin', over here the food hurt you
Cows goin' mad and the chickens crunk with bird flu

It's too ill how the food kills, it's like blue steel
Lies never set you free, but the truth will
The truth still matter, the proof is in the batter or the pudding

I don't remember what I was doing
There were no remembered witnesses to my doings
But it seems like I've known him forever

He who has moved through mornings and midnights
Through deaths and dawns
To document our bones, our blood, our lives
Listen, listen to his exact wings
Strumming mists from clouds

Listen, listen, a man always punctual with his mouth
Listen to his revolution of syllables
Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time with his hurricane beat
Asking us to pick ourselves up and become thunder

Yeah, they say you can't please everybody
Let's go, yeah, they ain't know what that sound like

Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat

Yo, what becomes of a dream deferred
That never makes it to the world to be seen or heard?
Do it breathe? Do it got a heartbeat? Is it alive?
Do it leave only to become a star in the sky?

I believe the scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential
Only usin' 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals
But incidentally, my energy heavenly
Can he be so ill? There ain't no, pill or no remedy

The maker of memories posses the recipe to your fate
Make no mistake, there ain't no escapin' your destiny
Especially when 'til death do us part, like wedding rings
I'll be here forever, put that on everything

You're everything man
You're everything man

Your alpha and your omega, your beginning and your end
Your father, your brother, your lover, your friend
The blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain
That's right, my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain

My name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train
All city, all night I'm enjoyin' the fame
I'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general
In the battle between God and the Devil

I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I'll do your hit in your kitchen and you're relief pitchin'
This kid proficient in every position
The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin' your vision

'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah, I'm standin' right here
I get you hot but stay cooler than the night air
I try to fit it in the same rhyme
But realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time

You're everything man
You're everything man

Seems like the first time I heard him was like

I guess was when I started to listen, I hate to say that but

I came all the way from Puerto Rico just to see Talib Kweli
Him, Mos Def, all of them man
I need them out here in my life
It's a rainy morning in New York City
",Everything Man,2007
Talib Kweli,"We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell

Every Sunday dressin' up, catchin' gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the First Chapter and Second Verse
If we all God's children then what's the word of the reverend worth

Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facin' time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy, it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly

Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryin' to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law accordin' to politicians

Who was King James, and why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessin' not a curse
I learned that heaven and hell exist right here on Earth, word

Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads
That Hell is called Babylon
And that's where them crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinkin' that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan

So it all sound the same to me, that's why when they say
One is right and the other is wrong, it just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No, that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see

The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual and recognize
That life is full of miracles, you could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who lookin' for God knowin' to go inside

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup

Livin' in mass confusion, lookin' for absolution
The gas induces psychopath, produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were sayin'
Tryin' to get to God but ended up doin' the work of Satan

Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make the rules of faith that you condition to
And gotta to follow and God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto
Then you know it well

[Incomprehensible] after me
Preacher says, he's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation

[Incomprehensible] you
I pray that God hears you
Take one look at your rear view
And if you see what I see
[Incomprehensible]

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

Hell, hell, hell, hell
Hell, hell, hell
We know that what we reap we sow

Talib Kweli,"Yeah, as a kid growin' up in Brooklyn
My pops was a DJ, he had a bunch of records
Funk, jazz, rhythm and blues, soul, you know what I'm sayin'?

There was this one gospel record I liked like, like
Like holy moly, I might get some religion and leave you holy, holy
Yeah, this rhyme is so fat, it's roly poly
I give you intimate details so you can get to know me

These corporate rappers like, ""Why this dude pickin' on me?""
You rap your way to the top but now it's gettin' lonely
Kids is hungry and you lookin' like a steak from Nick & Tony's
But don't nobody want your jewels 'cause your shit is phony

Say word? Your shit is real? Damn, your shit is corny
Rhymes turn a new page like Mark Foley
And touch kids like when Larry Clark gave the part to Chloe

Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York
Started out skatin' for Zoo York, word
Hangin' out at The Gavin, I was very lucky
To talk to Rash' once I got past Derek Dudley

Got him on respiration, that's pre-Badu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo
Sometimes I feel like I'm drownin', I gotta tread water
Head above the water, I always remember headquarters

Heads up, eyes open, I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line, my rhymes define opus
Sometimes hopeless people fill my thoughts with evil
My record so hard it broke the needle

At the Mixtape Awards niggaz act like they don't give a fuck though
And disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood claat? No, let the blood flow
You ain't come to pay your respect, then what you come fo'?

Too many good niggaz die, it's like a stop loss
Hood niggaz ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce
How you hard? The cops lettin' 50 shots off
Baby Jay-Z's with the knockoff Scott Storch beat

You are not Short, you are not Katt
You're not a player or a pimp, money stop that
Learn to master your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin' sweets, the beats weaker than gelatin

We used to kick up dust, now we settlin'
Rest in peace to Dilla, Weldon, we can't forget you
Professor X and Proof we miss you, word

Rest in peace to Shaka, 21 gun salute
In the air like blak, blak, blak
You're still here 'cause you're livin' through me
You're like a gift God has given to me, what?

Hip-Hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggaz got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan

Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation; this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto, these niggaz keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato

Suppliers who ride around the block, in the custom models
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth

Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle

Like, ""I bet they neighborhood ain't like this""
White kids wishin they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers

Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin, makin narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin out 'til we exorcise the demons that's inside us

Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves

So bright that you blindin' my sight

And you're my hot thing and you're my hot thing

Word, somebody like a flick, it got surprisin' twists

Award for best supportin' role go to your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph

I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me 'Off The Wall' like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty, my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

I love how you snap back and get the last laugh

I love the way your crib smell like Votivo candle incense
The white voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky, I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies

I love her, God bless you, your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shanice, baby, 'I Love Your Smile?

I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know?
A pimp told me if I love her, I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental

You need to tell your man, don't fight it, damn
Have you groupied out like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbin' walls like Spider-Man
Knees bucklin', you'll hit the floor when you try to stand up

So you drop it like it's hot, oh so heavy

I can get you taken now, think I couldn't when I could

Surrounded by the heavy herb

The crowd is more or less wall to wall here, for the pure
Hip hop, how I'm rockin' got them droppin' they jaw
Fire marshall blockin' the door, there's a crack like choppin' the raw
This the shit the cops stoppin' us for

This the rain of theTech and the muthafuckin' peanuts
Slice like a nip-tuck, specalizin' deep cuts
This the music that you ridin' to
Provided to you by Talib and Hi-Teck, the livest two

More grind, less wishin'
Less stuntin', more fame, less talkin', more change
Less rushin', more vision

The more natural, the less conscious
At the same time, the more I bomb shit the less the Devil got a grip
I'm gettin' loose, we gotta slip away the ghetto gotta get

More for a dollar, more fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores, less churches step lookin' like corner stores
More rap songs to stress purpose with
Less misogyny and less curses

Let's put more depth in our verses till they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground, the cop don't come around
You sorta hopin' for that reflection, you sorta open
I heed the call of the chosen, I don't play with your emotions

Stop actin' so goddamn emotional
I give you these bars for free like it's promotional
This ain't no marketin' strategy
It had to be from the heart in order to be reality, reflection

I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
Cause she's like ""That's what they wear in school""
Then she asked me ""Daddy, you know any superstars?""
I looked at her and said ""Stop being silly, that's what you two are""

You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke

Searchin high and low, behind the do', inside the drawer
Little did he know that the beat was tryin to find a flow
Stuck in limbo, how low can you go
A punched hole through your stomach lining like Tylenol
Build all kind of rolled, metaphors and similies
That'll have you doubtin my competitor's abilities

Lookin for a sweet face, in each case
Tryin to get they heartbeat racin, and the dark meat be tastin

Chokin' you out 'til you can't suck any air through
Fuck with your man too, thinkin' I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggaz are brand new

Ain't knew I was bad news? Look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Horror chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga, I'll harass you

I'll Ras Kass you, 'Soul On Ice' and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe' the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity to be the ones in a class of zeros

Hip hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation
You talk shit, Blacksmith, Jean, I'm waitin', nigga

Talk shit now, talk shit now
Talk shit now, talk shit now, talk shit, hey
Say something, say something
Say something, say something

We not fallin' for your trick 'cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it, every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the Lord and I'm askin' Him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggaz out the club like Michael Richards

Yeah, I admit it, I'm guilty, the way I spit it is filthy
I keep it gritty so they get it, they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language they know I keep customers

The writin' therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin' you a contact high, my name buzzin'
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin', nigga

Talk shit now, the year of Blacksmith
Is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers
Get the name right, BKMC, Talib Kweli, say it again

Get your hands in the air, get 'em up
Put your hands in the air, put 'em up

Here we go like, yes yes, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Ain't no sleep, y'all, to the break of dawn
5 o'clock in the morn, we keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on

We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the Vick
With deep pockets
And them dudes by them cars that turn 'em in to sweet objects
Of desire big rims and them tires

We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell, the clan of the cave bear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air

Come through like the cable guy, get her done
That 'ole hit 'n run, turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight it's catch me if you can, you can taste the gingerbread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Puttin' on some Airs, king for a day
Hard to face your fears, we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today, it's all a masquerade
Shorty, paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown

Found under the make up
I asked her, ""What's your passion?"", answered, ""What's the paper?""
She sleepin' they don't want her to wake up
Maybe they should realize their own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Yeah, steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
We gotta get it in, I'm slippin' in the darkness
Like most of the day is gone
We up all night, I wonder if you can hang
We used to hang from a tree
Now we hangin' behind the rope, we V.I.P.

We do it B.I.G., ain't no need to See I.D.
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery, six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance

The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes, you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced

The truth is so boring, you gotta pretend a little
The antidote's more colorful than the rainbow that end the Skittles
In the quest to trap the cat, game is your Tinder Fiddles
To get the Bruce to say the sky's fallin'
Like your Chicken Little, come on

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

But tonight you will be so fun
Soon a new day breaks the dawn
But tonight you will be so fun
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Won't you stay around with me?
And please say the rhyme
'Cause these rappers think that
I'm in love with your state of mind

'Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby, won't you stay around with me?
And let my love, let my love and let my love

Now Kweli, you should rap about this, you should rap about that
Any more suggestions? You in the back, yeah you
You should rap more on beat, you should rap more street
And never ever get your mack on please, how bout you?

I like the way you're melodic it's 'cause you capture hypnotic
Portraits and seem to make the average exotic
Probably unite, I know you getting some love
But you can't spit like a thug
And you a blow, you make a hit for the club, word

I don't like your voice, I don't like your choice of beats
It sounds like it's forced, and what was up with 'Back up offa me'?
I ain't like that, man you should get with Hi-Tek
Now he got nice tracks, them other dudes is type wack

Yeah, people keeping it coming, I keep it bubbling
Like the heat from oven boiling the water and the hate
So they light my fire

I got a mic empire, my own label
I had to emancipate me-me like Mariah
At some point I might retire, on some bullshit
My legacy, horseshit like Mariah's

Illest flow found in the game
Soothing like the sound of the rain
It's the dude profound with the fame
I refusing to be sounding the same

Keeping the verses, deleting the curses
Defeating the purpose when the people go on strike
I'm in the street with the workers
Speaking the words from a pulpit
Like the preachers at churches

Raise my hand, all the teachers get nervous
'Cause they know I air 'em out
And they ain't even really gotta hear me out
Keep it dirty like pigpen, voice in the warrior's head

Like [Incomprehensible]
Clocking like Big Ben, old school slang
Still find a way to innovate
Pete Rock got 'em feeling great, the ladies say

Won't you stay around with me?
And please say the rhyme
'Cause these rappers think that
I'm in love with your state of mind

'Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby, won't you stay around with me?
And let my love, let my love and let my love

Light the tip of the L, this heavyweight rap tipping the scale
And we never let the system prevail real picturesque, missing the sale
Never that, it's forbidden like the candy sisters lifting the veil
I'm still leading the pack, these cats lacking
Just because you be having a dragon don't mean you got the fire

It ain't nothing to play with, it's sacred
My pen is the paintbrush and dipping in paint plus
Truth, love, joy, anger, hatred and anguish
That's the spectrum of colors I paint with

I don't feast at the banquet
'Cause freedom is the set that I bang with
Listen the conditions in my slum village is tainted
I grew through the pavement
Like the flower the girl drew in the paper
The sky bluer and the [Incomprehensible] save you

The rules of engagement that they use, attitudes of a slave
Man got me stressed out losing my patience
The moves that I'm making across waters
Through contraband that I'm taking across borders
Information never lost in translation

Too many new words to be learned
I'm spitting fire giving third degree burns
Giving them heat stroke, hotter than rocking a P cote
[Incomprehensible], all these rappers super like me so, we go
Back in the days like reminiscing with Pete yo
Ladies welcome to the Kweli show, she goes

Won't you stay around with me?
And please say the rhyme

I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay

Year of the Ox, seven and three

And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again

Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worship what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye; we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where the hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it comeback in particular
We will never blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transition of the minister's original

Watching these haters operating with impunity
Its journey dollar signs, black and white collar crimes
Running out of time, out of sight, out of mind
It gets realer and it's real in Palestine

And five star generals telling lies in press conferences and interviews

Come forward
Sworn on my unborn son if there is one more war I will come for
Poor get poor, the rich just get richer
Get the just
You see the big picture?
China's ditched from a shake on the Richter
Mother earth strucks and we all get evicted
This some sick shit
Slightly twisted
Information from our nations capital
Capital is all the captain calls for
They just want more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)

[Chorus]
Take me away
Take me away from here
Take me away
I don't here you

My people crying, and be dining, 
They be dining in the hours, 
Drinking wine with their wives like everything is fine
Denying that they fighting for the their lives, 
Every night to survive since the beginning of time
Cant believe the evil that feeds off this so called American dream
Lies in the seat make all the Americans seem like blood-sucking money hungry fiends
But money doesn't mean
A damn thing to me
I just want to be
I want to be free
But unfortunately a fortune is what you need
Cause the fortune 500s run the country
Its one company
If your not a company
Would you mind grabbing me a cup of tea?
If we go hungry, in our own country
I wonder whats its like living in Hungry
Yeah, it isn't funny, but its coming
Its about to get ugly
Streets turn to a game of rugby

[Chorus]

We're buying bubbly and making rate 100s
Is it just me or is that some dumb shit
Yo what the fuck
Hoe comes
Little dumb shit
Lets go
(I know you can think of something)
Donate your dollars
Raise a dollar
Help a mother
Save a father
Cause poverty is probably our biggest problem
And it ain't gonna stop with Obama
To save the world we must start at the bottom

It's been a long time coming
Let me try something brand new
Hey yo Ski
What you ever do, man?
Come on
Yo, what we doing it for?

This is for the day-trippers and the hipsters
Whores and the fashionistas
Spiritual leaders practicing law to laws of attraction
The teachers who read the passages
From the back of a G
That be bustin' off Dalai Lamas or flashing heaters
The last of the boosters

With the shooting, the thugging and all the booning and spooning
And all the crooning, and cooning and auto-tuning, you laugh
You be tellin', peddlin' to consumers I'm helping them to see through it
Get with this new movement,
Let's move it

Through the cold rain
Still I'm standing right here
Even on winter summer days

Yeah I'm a product of Reaganomics
From the blocks where they rocking a feds like J Electronica
Drop and make this lock
If the promise is where the heart is
Whether Jesus or Mohammad
Regardless of where the Mosque is (word)

They hope for the Apocalypse like self-fulfilling prophecy
Tell me when do we stop it?
Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment?
Is the answer burning Korans
So that we can defend Islamics?
The end upon us with a hash tag, a trended topic

You take away the freedoms that we invite in the game
Then you disrespect the soldiers; you ask them to die in vain
In a desert praying for rain
The music's like a drug, and they tend to take it to vein
It ain't for the well-behaved

The soundtrack for when you're great, but its more for when you've felt afraid
More than your average rapper
So you sort of felt the way
The brain is like a cage, you a slave and that's why they lovin'
This the book that Eli that start with a K-W

Through the cold rain
Still standing right here
Even on winter summer days

Through the cold rain
Still standing right here
Even on winter summer days

I do it for the trappers, other rappers
The backpackers, the crackers
The niggas, the metal-packers
The victims of ghetto factories

I do it for the families, citizens of humanity
Emcee's, endangered species like manatees
I do it for the future of my children
They the hope for the hopeless

Karma approaches, we gon' be food for a flock of vultures
The end of the world
Ain't nothing left but the cockroaches
And the freedom fighters
We're freedom writers like Bob Moses

The chosen, freedom writers like Voltaire 
For my block, my borough, my hood, my city, my state, yeah
My obligation to my community is so clear
Yeah, we gotta save them, this opportunity so rare

We do it so big over here that it's no bare
To the punks, bitches, the chumps, the snitches, the sneak in the game
We let them live although they're weak and they're lame
The bozo's and joker's, promoting when they're speaking my name

Watch me flip it like the Blacksmith logo
I shine a light through the darkness when the night is black as Yaphet Koto
All these rappers lookin' mad in photos
Saddest player braggadocio quality make up for what a lack a promo

You say you blast a fo-fo, nah you don't shoot 
It's more like you shot me an email, but forgot to attach the vocals
Call 'em a bastard like their dad, a no show
I'm too fast for slow pokes running on the track with Yoshi Yamamoto's

This ain't fashion rap, I'm bringin' the passion back
Find me where the trouble at that's my natural habitat
I take it wit me in the booth
To delivery we owe respect to the dead we only owe the truth

So if somebody feelin' disrespected even when his face is smilin'
His heart rate escalates to violence
Look at their trouble, jugglin' drugs
Using, abusin', beautiful strugglin' they were usually bubblin'

It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless
Spit game way to real they don't promote it
Cause the way I approach it from another angle
I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows

It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold
It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll
So turn it up loud and turn it up now
Turn it up loud, turn it up now

Welcome to my hood where the rainbows is in the gutter
The pain that you will discover is making the angels shutter
There's sex in the city but we never claimed to love her
I know you heard of us we're more murderous than Cain famous brother

Livin' with death smoking blunts with the Grim Reaper
Snitch niggas known to blow the whistle like a gym teacher
This gum flapper swear he a gun clapper
Nah sumthin' backwards he really a dumb rapper

The trap on the corner with the oil spillin'
Mixed with the dirt and the water collected in the gutter til the colors brilliant
I paint pictures so legendary
I been doing this your history is as short as the month of February

In a leap year, what do we fear?
Dead bodies lying on the ground nothing to see here
Be clear don't ever cross me like police lines
'Cause libertarians will not be invited to tea time

It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock 'n' roll
So turn it up loud and turn it up now
Turn it up loud, turn it up now

Feel that war whip around a building to form a corner tornado
Findin' nature in the city we cover our feet in gators
Bugatti's to bodegas they sellin' rotten tomatoes
Stackin' chips and I don't mean potato there go another one

Graduated from quarter waters and Butter Crunch
Tuxedo nice with a gun tucked in his cummerbund
He get it from his mama he ain't nothin' but his mother's son
She used to get it popping like bubblegum

Peddling poison was often better employment
The ghetto destroying any sense of self she was enjoyin'
Survival of the fittest by any means necessary
Got us calling drug dealers revolutionaries

You say he kill his people he say I feed my family
And you ain't kickin' in you'll never understand me
You just stand in my way now you an obstacle
And obstacles end up in the hospital

Talib Kweli,"Everyday since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me

Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

When are we gonna grow up
Why do I love you so much we so touched
Excited by the drama we like when it show up
The fighting don't slow up I light you like close ups

And I call you my Calamity Jane you like my fantasy
Love cause the same chemical reaction in the brain as insanity
Holidays drinking with your family passionate folks
Imagine if they had their own reality show actually no

Desires like fire quit playing or get burned
Or give it away on camera like Montana Fishburne
Our presence is a gift a gift is our present
Breakup text call her a bitch under my breath
And then the makeup sex she forgive me in a session
I know she love me she sending a mixed message though

Everyday since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

You need a chick with some fire
I mean unless you want a wife cold as ice
Living life with the biggest debutante
Me and you we considered the upper echelon

The only one I come out my fitted for in a restaurant
You can get it huh remember I was taking your digits 
Same night I was making the visit
Make it the mission to make you cum 
When we done sometimes you hate to admit it

You a little numb from the toys
And love the noise that you make when you run from the boys
And comfort your man insane how we go so crazy with it
This the asylum so we call relationships committed

You ain't a bird I ain't them others guys that get lost in the name
You the butterfly and I'm the moth to your flame
Love is dying while the mothers crying
Big brother eying me imposing their reality to Shutter Island

Everyday since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

Our love is like a Psycho or a trilogy the drama is killing me
I'm grown but the little boy is still in me
We discuss monogamy polygamy the odds of probability
Your momma ain't feeling me it stung like a killer bee

How far from the tree do the apple fall
The things I said was it how I felt was it the alcohol 
Or do I really hate her after all
I apologize for the statements that I made to her

First I swallowed my pride then I ate my words
I tried to pass it off acted like it was nothing
The fact is I was discovering my appetite for destruction
Everything else is bland once you tasted filet mignon
When I'm full I'm taking you home your a plate for later on
I'll eat it up or beat it up
Til your love runneth over yo I need a cup

Everyday since we first met

Talib Kweli,"Yeah, I like that
Snap your fingers
You can do it all by yourself
You can do it all by yourself

I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me

And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low, get low, but you never been as low as me

I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching

I better find a way, if not I better make a path
One that's seldom traveled by the masses
I never get stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist

I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
'Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison, listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do it for

People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell 'em change is God you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle
Still cursing, still pursing my lips to pull purple but,

I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low, get low but, you never been as low as me

Witness it, the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey that's ahead of us
Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us
That's why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus, no Oedipus 

but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist

Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low

Ain't nowhere to go but up, go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up?
But know enough to know this was done by the collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity
What the fuck is a celebrity?

I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low, get low, but you never been as low as me",So Low,2011

Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
'Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war

Hey! - blow the horns on 'em
The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order
Go feed the hands birds cover the cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
'Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell

Yea homie, I been? since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No teller no reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
'Cause I seen a lot of n-ggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire f-cks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace?
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

Where the leaders live in a house of a lie like Don Chito

What kind of celebrating do you like to do?
A right to passage or the flashing lights that's blinding you
Haters you, wanna bring you down cause you trying to
Have a good day like O’Shea back in ‘92
Giving myself a minus to, bounce like the beat I'm rhyming to
If I see you got the devil up inside of you
Name another rider who, will provide you with the truth
Or keep tighter than the bodies do
That's why they try to take him out like Chinese food
Cause of the special delivery, it’s a sign of the fertility, dead like shvelry

The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on his way
They closing in on me, I feel like every day
Music saves me, soothing like the navy
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars
So I took the vibe with me using my life
Yep, I propose the main music my wife
If ever need to call a nigga music's my night
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to
I watch purpose prophesize about going through
Music ain't the knowledge itself
And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal lines
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me
I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy
Now all the people who go irresponsibly
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use
Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you
My music gives you a message true or respect is due
But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual
A tree in form of a far is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create the same
Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it
Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us

And he could run before he walked",Before He Walked,2013
Talib Kweli,"I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like ""sure""
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: ""Ooh-Dee-Whoo""
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi how you say, ""voulez vous?""
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Hey you, hey you, hey you

Simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I mange, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically ""yes""
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her ""why you stare"" - that's a ""yes""

Talib Kweli,"My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped her develop the powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking the hell and the sour
Reaching out to god cause the devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said ""no, you're wrong, cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scheme
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds, but they ain't new to me.""
Yo, I hate when the fit is proun, is like
Everytime I pick up the phone you bitch moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for, press to the norm
Make me wanna never get involved

I need to rip these benefits
Uh, you so sensitive
I say serve this rarity
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings

Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On tweeter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling the hemoglobin
And lead the side the arguments never move me
Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
The beat is on like horses, is hard to keep 'em stable
She believed me the way Michael believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather roam or weather storms
She like a tree, now got me looking for Fema
Cover in my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better

Talib Kweli,"This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people thought that we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a brush submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you five for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Desire the flavor, design of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm a pathlight
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? He don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
The genie and the princess bride inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and paper
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t want quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is ripped, this is our original spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we in turbulence
The mothers be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
Love will fix its dead ass for the Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so I’m on outerspace, they funny like they're bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the play
I see to get a faith for last yielding to the hate
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah
Believe I get a sew-in, streaking like a ?
Sunny in Dolores bright park a
Fly chick's sparking
Then we have to roll to the finish of some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony ? rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, ? gon' be speaking it
Oh, it’s how you lickety spit

The great debate of the saviour, that caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favourite communicator
News junky I’m the one can admit the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they spinning it like a ?
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up and directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft this should be against the law, illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life

High life, high life
High life, high life

An idle mind is usually described as the devil’s playground
My rep established I'm rapping just for the sport of it
Been nice for a career, you just barely grasping the thought of it
Indebted to the hood like a Rush Card
Support her like push-up bras and lumbars
Except I’m never sitting, I’m ever-living like Mummm-Ra, I’m the sun god
Smart as a whip, but forever rippin it dumb-hard
I see you fronting with your dollar store shades on
Faker than abs that’s sprayed, artificial as rayon
Run a set of fine you questify like ray don
Shung when I'm forming like voultron of young Raekwon
Mix in a bit of KRS-One and Q-tip
Rock him some of that ice cube, now who’s this
No one as gifted as this, so magnificent
Classically consistent, I’m nasty as black licorice
Coldest, but I get the room hotter than bikram yoga

Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune
No acclamation, no golden seal
You sick side, gotta flush it down
We talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you're out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut

Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you're made to do

Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a thing to do
Won't taste no foods like they put you
No more wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vault

Set to my lane but still ain't listening
Got ice in the vans we make so frigid
Still in the kill brain self when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don't stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving
We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison
But just because the president was black there's no racism?
Postracial? More like most racial
They hate for you disgraceful

Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause

Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
‘Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em

The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga

Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace

I ain’t asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming on through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked, yeah
Draw it like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leadears the lazy as lolly
Gagging on my ground, getting guap cause green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that

Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

Ayo we drink good, smoke good
This cat wearing funny hats like the pope wore
I come in looking quite clean in the loafer
So hood, might scheme up to no good
You know crook got sling in the notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I would
I still rep POC's like I'm supposed to
Come alive and down throw like I know I should
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I’m in the ring so lean I need a phone ?
I ain’t lying, Batista Ferocious
Maybe I’m lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I’m complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again)
I’m complete in my devotion

Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people",Turnt Up,2013

Oh

Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in ""The Other Guys""
Got me in another zone they call her Sunshine like
""Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home""
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, man I, uh

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak ill of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line

I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
""Pow!"" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you rockin my boat like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, official like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down

First, I'm sayin hi, then I'm wavin bye-bye
We get in, we get in
Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly

Yo, these swallows is horny like charley parker
Be cutting em cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology
Follow em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending a life
Came over for a closure, ended up spending the night
That cosy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they question him where he got them
Forgot it was her, she threaded him, fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so static, she shaded him like a faddic
Every single chick, shes like enough already
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She once reacted to things he did in the past
Thinking it was no safe, he couldn't say no to the ask
The heavy so rash, she gave up all her power
He boarded out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How shes so accepting all this tension in her life?

She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Afraid to say cause she dependent on man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Battery in the back, popping up with the cop
Top popular with the acid, the hot attack
Niggas whooping the holla out the drama
The way she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option mcdonalds or telemarket
Often her asking together, this ain't the beatles
She need is a man like she going under needle
She doing so much cotton, it's a wonder she living
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she fell like a woman was when a dude screamed
Nice ass out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her rocket cause the make-up is like the mash-bomb
Scars proeminently large on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit cards scheme she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
Shes waiting out the station
Just the same as shes waiting out the station
Late at night for a train that never came

She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Afraid to say cause she dependent on man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Talib Kweli,"I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
It’s sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When it’s no power go sour
I seen him crossing a bridge by the masses
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Made it in New York and the way that we talk
Make it to North and that’s a gift
Refuse to back, lay to mourn, and then tore it over
Look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
The popular, adore his pain for the sins of the god father
Popular music got ‘em confused with killers and artists
I kill it the hardest competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cause my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up, you just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I’m a legend like too common
Or the Chupacabra, the way I move it together it’s how I knot ‘em
Make them acclaim my cover, you daquiri with the
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Vicious, New York can rip you, be ripping it like a shred
Some symphony hall shit, getting higher than your faucet
Getting better, trouble pearl of your jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appoint and preserved us with past errors
That never seen their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they’re smitting with the taste of blood and ticking
They taking enough drugs for the sleeping and keeping it fucking and make it up
Raise the bar and the waiters up
Others hating, just confused, undergo the way to luck
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us
For the worthless who don’t get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they’re concerned from on the table on the way to love
Take a slump, feel it to raise a child, you got to raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up, raise it up, take it up, take it up",Human Mic,2013

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds

Check it out baby, check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit, what is this?

I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit'
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them
My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath

Check it out baby, check it out y'all

Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious
Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage
Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mansions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth

Dopamine, dopamine

I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine

See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I feel then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night with a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game and it's gettin' laid and that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene

Is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober

Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your
Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up
We the ""hell ya"", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up

Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it
Money, long slates, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
No, they need it for support, everyone that promote it
I best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them

My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload

Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think ""Don't take, will""

Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat

They live in the shadows of the angels

Talib Kweli,"Remember, whatever discipline you’re in
Whether you’re a musician or a photographer
A fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer
A singer, a designer — whatever you do
You have one thing that’s unique
You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard
Things go wrong — in life and in love 
And in business and in friendship and in health
And when things get tough, this is what you should do
Make good art

This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)

We're in a transitional world right now because 
The nature of distribution is changing
The distribution channels that people have built 
Over the last century or so are in flux
The print, the visual artist, the musicians
 which on the one hand intimidating and on the other
Immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions
The now-we're-supposed-tos of how you get your 
Work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down
The gatekeepers are leaving their gates
You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen
The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are
So make up your own rules",Inner Monologue,2014
Talib Kweli,"That's all I wanna do, baby
I mean really
I mean, I go out there, I work my whole life, baby
I put it down for you
I put it down for our kids
See, as a man I ain't got no excuse, baby
I'm the voice of the struggle
All I wanna do is write love songs about you

Love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug
Love is the gift, love the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Never so strong, love is reap
When you saying love me it doesn't matter

See, babe, I got so much love to give
I don't got an ounce, I don't got grams
I got kilo's of love
Kilo, kilo, kilo, kilos of love",Lover's Peak,2014
Talib Kweli,"Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you ""gay""
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more
Some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door
I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it
Like it was pottery or the mouth with the law
Twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor
Furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore
So they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top off the law
If your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all
I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me
Ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece
So when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming
Catch up with us cause we leaving

Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus
Though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath
What would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught
I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming
Catch up with us cause we leaving

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself onward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of this unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)

Talib Kweli,"Gravitas, light it up
Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli

Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma
I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight
Too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time like langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five

1989 was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the Tec nine
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside of Tower devouring prey
Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons
Shabba was liking to call you son
'Cause you mine I call you son 'cause you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors, pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L, Big Poppa, Big Pun, 2Pac
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too classic it's blow to vacate to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recording we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux
I'm the underground king like I'm rolling with Bun, the vets know what's up
The flow is nuts it's solid I got the golden touch
Plus my Iron Sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest calibre do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common
Almost 20 years after the release of Soundbombing
And it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech 9 getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toads, way cold
Continue to pave the road for the Kendricks and J Coles
Continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant
The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait",Rare Portraits,2014
Talib Kweli,"From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake
No different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is ""Love & Hip Hop""
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object
Major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him
In her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting a part of his suffering
And this young man clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food; Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She don't love it no more",State of Grace,2014

Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son

You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé
I know my vision beyond some other shit
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone
I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga

Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas
Forgetting silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist

We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota
I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing, we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math, my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half

Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is [?]

Niggas wanna kick knowledge?
Y'all niggas ain't deep man, y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Let's go, let's go

You can lead a man to a drink
But you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link
But that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit
I peeped it, scared of a motherfuckin' secret
Society and only bein' with people you agree with
You scared of a chalice scared of death
Only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars
Symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights
Or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti
My enemy tryna stop me but I don't stand a chance
If I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state
And they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars
Early Illuminati was sorta like the students
In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em
Turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real, you know the deal
But still perpetuate the cycle of violence

Thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading
If you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister
Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine
Iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency
But still paying your taxes
It ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of the enemy
I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

So it's not a problem to feel
Welcome to the Age of Aquarius in the stages of various schemes
Precariously I escape when I dream
Each scene should win an Academy, put it up on the screen
My strategy: Pharoahe's the king of Queens
Who fiends for teens to view it as the new theme music
Use it to shape their futures when they daydream to it
Never elusive, never claim stupid
Lucid, boost your recruits when you sing to it and just, dream

I've got dreams

You know I'm down right excellent, about my scrilla, get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all

Come on, you know the deal, y'all
Five o'clock in the morning, just getting home from last night's performance
When I'm dead tired from touring I hit the coffin
I'm like a vampire required to stay dormant
Out of the range, the sunlight with a dotted remain
I used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain
I took a break, had to find life's meaning again
Without the smoke in my lungs I started dreaming again
I dreamed of candy-coated cars and panties that go with bra's
Hurricanes named Sandy, I'm floating on Noah's ark, what?
Police'll bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns (that's ridiculous)
The truth is I'm one of the best
And when you snooze that's when you meet the cousin of death
So when I say I never visited the cousin, I don't sleep

Just to show that I inherited your gambling ways

Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Grandma can I get a scratch off?

It's all or nothing, quit with all the bluffing
Soon as one of my cards decline, I'm in my wallet shuffling
Not so lucky, I guess that's how it's looking
I'm a pro and not a rookie, I school you all and I play hookie
These were my times with Sookie
Tea kettle whistling if she ever left the stove on
Old age had kicked in and she sent me for a store run
Gambling is in your blood, ain't superstitious but you're definitely knocking on one
If I win we all won
Behaving, imagine the good grandson that I've been
Grandma give me the missing numbers, the cash that I need
Used to love the bodegas, now they ask for I.D
Had my own two dollars just to get some scratchers for me
Around that time things were drastic, worrying 'bout our finances
Didn't no one give them to me, I was the one who finance us
Said fuck whoever doubted, that's when I took my chances
Feel strongly about whatever I believe in cause I'm a Cancer
Ain't an auction but they gave my mans a bid
Damn the CC8 just filled another bed

Voice of the unheard, louder than the bomb
Grandma's boy couldn't be prouder of my mom
For this historical perspective, a political education
I hardly ever gamble, my risk was too calculated
Caught up in the traps, to be highly and discrete
Red dollar and rented dream and get you followed by the feds
Cause this life is like a lottery, a loser then you'll probably be
Living with the ghost, like Debbie Moore with the pottery
Testing our morality when facing our mortality
Betting on a fallacy, handing over our salaries
Natural born killer, they call us Mickey and Mallory
'Til our men become warriors and our women become Valkyries
Cussing like some sailors in the open seas
Mama got the silk for the apartment smelling like potpourri
Shopping for the groceries
Got her a pepsi cola and some coke for me
Making a quick stop out the OTB

Repeat it and treat it and we playing against the odds
If we can only defeat it
We'd see it, but we standing weeping whenever we read it
And then we feeling cheated, we deserve better
Cause she done earned cheddar and I know she took her turn
Being Tina Turner, let her be returned from her ghetto
You'd know all she want is world peace if you let her
And one day we may travel, if you bought that scratch off
Like Payola at a DJ battle
And it paid off, then we made off like Madoff
And ate off that plate, constantly concentrated like Adolf
Came all the way, four hours in your heart though
Showing up in my school, saying we hit the lotto
Popped a bottle then saw that we misread it at second glance
That's when I learned life isn't up to chance

Makin' these MC's our sons like Horus
I'm always taking shots like a Japanese tourist, get the picture?
Flyer than Keyser Soze and no exposure

I'm sippin' wishing well water imported from Pluto
That's why my eyes is glassy, so ain't got to ask me
The interplanetary Illuminati move your body
I trekked the stars first, so fuck Kirk and Scotty
I threw basement parties on the Mothership
Now I'm on planet Earth on some other shit
Many 'habitants of this world be strivin and struggling
Tryin to eat food and keep the rights to they publishing, huh
Ghetto red hot, man that shit is like bubbling
Can't get no peace 'cause the Beast keep troubling
Youth, they oppose and the blows they be doubling
Nike heads is trife and the shots, they be thundering
Ways and customs don't make any sense
They be givin' me stress and they test my maintenance
Use the sand and the Ummah as my sustenance
No, this style will never lack, melanin's my evidence

In order to effective, with your words you must be selective
'Cause showin' and provin' is the Prime Directive
Movin those who are outdated with vernaculated thought, so
Every time I take a turn MC's take a loss
My point across, I gotta get to where I want to be
As the wickedest public speaker since '73
Or '74, which was the year I first touched ground
As the physical manifestation of sight and sound
So gather 'round, to hear the profound brown vomiter
Absorb the sonic energy manifestin' through your monitor

Lyrically a miracle, mentally I'm physical
Massively I'm critical, verbally invincible

Simply because it's coming straight out of Brooklyn
It sounds so out of sight I got the blind people lookin'

They see a flash in the pan waitin' for royalties

But kings and queens get overthrown when they grab the microphone
Shootin' videos in homes that they know they'll never own
I guess they cannot work alone, they forever with crew
L sparking, steady barking 'bout the wildness they do
Posin' in photographs shot at complimentary angles
Be playin Mr. Tuffy when they feminine like bangles
Practices is fraudulent, fallacies record to tape
Step in my zone, your spot'll get blown like Watergate

Wait, my blastin' rate is past a state of rappers who procrastinate
Mr. Man is great, so every time I rhyme, I fascinate
Masses hate to have to wait for me to unload
So I flip into my mode and rhyme long like a road
See, I drop the greats like clumsy waiters drop plates
I got rhymes by the crates to erase the duplicates
'Cause, I blow wack rappers out like afros
My shit is so phat it be stretchin' my asshole

I make MCs wonder like bread but then, bread gets toast

Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery

So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check

A wise man know what he know and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his bible he'll never question
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience

Let it roll, coming at waves

All my language is romantic
So Latin, I don't even know Spanish
All I know is I'm scorched to the Puritans
Most tyranis rapper on the whole planet
I'm the one who was never supposed to be here
I'm the one the haters see, let's be clear
Bet now you remember me
Give you a reminder cause you act like your memory
Lost like Dory, while you off Finding Nemo
Talkin' you a boss you as soft as Brian Eno
Tellin' all these stories, why you lying to the people?
Why you frontin' like you wanna but you rhyming kinda emo?
Tryna find a needle in a haystack is easier than tryna find a leader in the mainstream media
Never knowing where we headed
Until we're following each other off the cliff like Lemmings

But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves

Let it roll get bold, big daddy Kane style never gonna get old
Spit flows to leviticus at skid row
Tip toe when you entering the zip code
Pistols brandishing we never hand them in
Accessory to crime gotta handle the shenanigans
And a hand got rings like the mandarin
Ugly scents picking polo working piece the mannequin 
Now I'm feeling like the new wave
Like I'm two days deep into my blue phase
My baby hate that I'm living out a suitcase
Like I forgot to tie the knot like a shoelace 
Let me be your liberator
Get yourself together we gonna we each other later
You could be my lover you could be another hater
Why you frontin' trying to run from all the CVS behavior like

Documenting the struggle I'm huddling with historians
Making a way back to Brooklyn like we the warriors
Told you this man's story bordering on vainglorious
Heading to Cali for an education of Sonny Carson
And the need to police resurrection of Johnnie Cochran
Never accepted the rejection 'cause failure never an option

Pardon my french like Remy Martin and Henny bottles
The chances of survival more shallow than winning lotto
The liquor that they swallow got them rattled
Playing Benny Blanco bravado
Look at 'em fronting for these models
La mujeres mulattos and the floor with the wobble wobble
Sipping moscato while selling themselves for follows
This is intense like a Pentecostal revival
I'm in these streets like potholes
Where the guns make Illinois to Chicago
Bap bap bap like staccato
I spit it like I just finished gargling the velocity marvelous
Get your goggles we hit it at full throttle
I'm praying for a better tomorrow
My candle is burning slow as cubanos
I'm seeing red like Ricky Ricardo
They tried to stop my product like an embargo
But see they wallow in their sorrows
So they promises is empty and hollow, mahalo
Uh, live my life in the sunshine
Bust rhymes beautiful as the sunrise
Plus side but the orchestra like I'm Sun Ra
Got with Alchemist like a wonder twin then we combine
The face of God got the finest features
And she listening if you tryna reach her
High Valyrian rap looking for my Khaleesi

Went from Mexican villas straight to Texas for grills

It's left for the children, the hate is so real son
But they full of jealousy and it's killing them
They stressed in their feelings
When I tell her don't let them affect how she feels
She throw the blame right back at me, how we expect to heal?
Investigating like she be waiting for a detective shield
Better still feeling insecure about her sex appeal
She know she cute when she catching a little attitude
She know I love her when she wear her hair natural
She let me back in her life and I show my gratitude
I try to curb my habit of acting like other rappers do

Praise the Lord and pray, we the children of God
Better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith, but it's hard
What more could I say?
Feelin' cursed, so I talk this way
Gotta write what I'm livin' in graffiti
It's the hood hieroglyphics
So I'm lookin' for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin'
You could picture me holdin'
You could never picture me foldin'

Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It's all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the Real You?
I don't know it's still you
How can I tell if you under a spell
Did the Fake You kill you?
Do they pass the mic in the afterlife?
If so let me spit flows
Good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away
Castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a Castaway
Because I feel like I'm swimmin' on an island
When I'm gettin' introspective, that's radio silence
When I'm fuckin' up program directives, that's radio violence

You're the one who wants to slow me down
I'm a criminal when you're around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain't no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I'll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that's a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Are we growin' apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah's Ark
We battin' down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin' them chemtrails
My intel says they makin' people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off it don't end well
I ain't know you like to get wet, dog, like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin' like a fish scale
Till' you chasin' a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale

Born this way, Capricorn, L.A
On the day of January 15th
Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb
Formed from the clay
Existing shifting from the essence uplifting
In the presence just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled the blessing, blissed up
My first breath in outer space
I kissed death in it's face
No identity complex, it gets left in it's place
Proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood
Corpuscle boils, I'm pressin' issues
It's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's business to play and get paid
During this clone of her DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire water, elixir of liquor with soft 
Or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom
Poor black, white sexy texture of lovers like jungle fever
Wild zebras to make this fetus, brother, the son of my father
I want to hear my one Shawki, and my daughter
Aja lecture selections in musical meters
In physics you should explore or visit more exquisite shores in districts
Take a breather, believe in your epic
God, remember you are a descendant of natural leaders
Extended from both levels in Bethlehem and even need 'em
In new testaments, heaven's an image in books
Messages, read 'em
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge in Europe, the mathematics of Mayans and metholithic structures

Bresha Meadows, resemble my baby girl
14 years old taking a place in this crazy world
Her and her brothers lived in fear of their father's rage
He beat their mother so awful, she prayed for the day she could be far away 
On Father's Day an awkward occasion, would daddy fall from grace
Embrace the alcohol, call mommy a whore, put her back in her place
With black eyes, broken ribs, slashin' her weight
No speculation, just the facts of the case
Stated: Allegedly wavin' a gun in her face
After all that he came back, and was great, right?
Tired of hearin' mommy scream ""put the gun away""
She knew that when she got the courage she would run away
But what about her brothers, she couldn't leave her mother
They told the cops, but all that did was make them treat them rougher
So what was she to do?
She did what she was told to do
Exposure to violence increased the amount of violence that you open to
Why bother when the system support her father
Gradually her thoughts got darker
Do you kill yourself or kill the monster that's making you suicidal?
Decision's too heavy for the mind of a child

Bloodstained floors

They say karma is a bitch
And when you take a life
You pay the price
We shootin' in these moments
To confuse your violence with a way of life
They funnel us from schools to the prisons, it's like they made a pipe
The conclusion that we reach is that the solution is that we take the fight to you
Bresha Meadows, took matters in your own hands
14 years old with more courage than a grown man
Grabbed the gun that he threatened to whip
Crept in the bedroom, put the bullet in his brain while he slept
It left his daughter with post-traumatic stress disorder
She the phoenix out the flames, metamorphosis
Survivin' in the meadow's house was kinda like a war
He threatened to kill her mother and her brothers many times before
The justice system is a profit
They shuffle us to prison, but shit it's just as toxic for women to get a judge to listen
At first the family freaked out, but deep down they felt relief
""Wipe the tears from your cheek, Mama you free now""
Family wearin' purple in the court room
Prosecution lookin' at the feds like make your move
Chance of beatin' this murder for life, zero
Her Mama, doin' interviews like, ""she's my hero""
She shed no tears for her husband
Years to succumbing to her fears, have made her numb

Talib Kweli,"Peace, Peace
Everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created that moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse from the radiance to the gift which becomes a shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror, or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy which my mind then depicts as images
Same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space, time and space disappear
I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, Poof!
It is always now
All is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation: energy, which is everything
Everything is one ocean of energy
Everything is within you
Everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets rotating around the sun in the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah, yes, all is one and, my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace, forever

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at?
What era is this?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us you might as well get it straight
We the content creators we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for a fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realize I can change what's going on (Let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (Let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come

All I have, are miles full of promises of home.

It seems so long; eternity,

But everywhere I turn to
Begins a new beginning
But never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know

You go there you're gone forever
I go there I'll lose my way
If we stay here we're not together
Anywhere is

The moon upon the ocean
Is swept around in motion
But without ever knowing
The reason for its flowing
In motion on the ocean
The moon still keeps on moving
The waves still keep on waving
And I still keep on going

You go there you're gone forever
I go there I'll lose my way
If we stay here we're not together
Anywhere is

I wonder if the stars sign
The life that is to be mine
And would they let their light shine
Enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
But night has clouded over
No spark of constellation
No Vela no Orion

The shells upon the warm sands
Have taken from their own lands
The echo of their story
But all I hear are low sounds
As pillow words are weaving
And willow waves are leaving
But should I be believing
That I am only dreaming

You go there you're gone forever
I go there I'll lose my way
If we stay here we're not together
Anywhere is

To leave the tread of all time
And let it make a dark line
In hopes that I can still find
The way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
Begin a new beginning
Still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
It's either this or that way
It's one way or the other
It should be one direction
It could be on reflection
The turn I have just taken
The turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the end.",Anywhere Is,2002

Dreams give me wings
My living journey is in full swing
There are still many days to go on my way
Childhood is only opening grade
I will try, I will fly
And everything will be alright

I met a boy with a gun

Be with me, I need to feel your passion
It feels like we’re here alone
Yeah, we don’t need to hang on the phone
 
Fiesta, play
With me now and stay
Here, 'cause both of us like it
Can’t understand why you wanna fight it

And there will be no need to lie
So tired of ugly places and fucking faces
Is this really my life?
Me and my girlfriend are ready for
Emergency vocation, need adventures to breathe

Reminds me of this damn movie “Thelma and Louise”
 
No more nights
The time when we’re free to do whatever we please
To waste a chance
Reminds me of this damn movie “Thelma and Louise”
 
Drinking, thinking, looking all around
And finally we decided to steal a car
Inside we found some credit cards
It was enough to go very far
To forget about the routine of life
About all the people, who made us cry
We are standing on the edge of a cliff
It would be better, if we are able to fly
 
No more nights
The time when we’re free to do whatever we please

Let’s play a game until it will be enough
Don’t give a half, share all your love
Never give up, hear the beat of your heart

Let’s go, go, go and rock the world

But I've tried everything to make you stay, , 
I'm blinded by a fading memory, , 
Of hoping you'll be back again someday

I'd give up everything just to hold you once again, 
I'm praying for a reason to make you understand, , 
And if I knew the answer, rest assured I'd let you in 

All I want it's plain to say, 
Remember the yesterdays, take a chance on the dream, 
All I want it's in my eyes, 
Believe in a miracle, somewhere in the night

Oh, I called your number, but you just let it ring, , 
Maybe it's because you're not alone tonight, 
It's getting harder as the days go bye, 
And this emptiness, is killing me inside 

All I'm asking now, is that you help me ease the pain, 
I need your love just to shelter me from the pouring rain,

I need to know girl, if our climates right 
Give a sign in the night 
We can take it all the way

Talisman,"I caught her staring, a psychedelic dancer,
Green velvet down to her thighs,
We took a ride in a blissful celebration,

A zillion roses fell down from the sky,
Romanced about the garden,
With the beads around our soul

Something bout the way she took my love inside,
We took a stroll in the sun, danced by the moonlight,
Visions of Brubaker light up dreams

Now rivers may run, but skies fall to blue nights,
Cause nothings as true as, my love child,
I kissed her sweet lips, somehow knew the answers to all,
The everyday questions of love

Now years may go bye, still I know we'll be together,
It's written in the rising stars above

I swear I'd surely die if she would ever walk away,
I fear we never wake from this recurring dream,

Those are the words I'm saying to you, 
Time after time

You were, I was, given one more try
Gave your body, and soul desire, 
I did my best to win your love again
But I didn't see it coming, it came up from behind
And left me lying, left me lying for dead
Just when it seemed you were missing, 
You're begging to come in.

Time after time, you tell me you're sorry

I guessed it from the start, yeah
You took my love and you threw it away
Now I know, you done me wrong

Stop pretending, there's no reason

I was a victim, in your act of treason, 
But now this comes as no surprise

Mine to give, only you can spare it
You could be the 1 I'm living 4

Love was always the compromise
I'd always heard it'd be

Now once you've come undone

In your arms I've got a place to live
A new place to hide

Anytime and anywhere I turned away

You gave me all your golden years
In return I left unknowing tears
Now the tables turning 'round my way
'Cause a part of me has died since you been gone

Do you believe it's best we live
Our lives without each other?
Do you believe we can go on our separate ways?
If you do, I will shed a tear goodbye

I dream to get back yesterday
When everything would simply go our way
We never had to look between
All the lines could turn the night to day

Do you believe it's best we live
Our lives without each other?
Do you believe we can go on our separate ways?
If you do, I will shed a tear goodbye

It's too late for restitution
Too late for sorry now
And if you go for good
I've lost it all, this I can't allow

So I'm asking for another try
I will lay out all the reasons why
Won't you pick me up, I'm flat on the floor?
I will never let you down another day

Do you believe it's best we live
Our lives without each other?
Do you believe we can go on our separate ways?
If you do, I will shed a tear goodbye

Talisman,"I see it's clear in your eyes
We've been through this before
No need to fabricate this war

To worlds exist and fall apart
To fantasies expire
The question is love worth fighting for?

Have I lost all my faith
How do I really know?

We sail on troubled waters to reach a sacred land
Who knows the sunshine from the rain?
We ride on troubled waters, we need a higher plan
To know the pleasure from the pain

I see no rhyme or reason
Beyond all fantasy
Only the lonely understand

Are destinies decided?
One touch can change it all
We're strangers in a stranger land

Have we lost all our pride
How do we really know?

We sail on troubled waters to reach a sacred land
Who knows the sunshine from the rain?
We ride on troubled waters, we need a higher plan
To know the pleasure from the pain

Have I lost all my faith
How do I really know?

We sail on troubled waters to reach a sacred land
Who knows the sunshine from the rain?
We ride on troubled waters, we need a higher plan
To know the pleasure from the pain

I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
I couldn't live like that, no siree!
I couldn't do the things the way those people do.
I couldn't live there if you paid me to.

I'm tired of looking out the windows of the airplane
I'm tired of traveling, I want to be somewhere.
It's not even worth talking
About those people down there.

We've heard this little scene, we've heard it many times.
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time.
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me.
Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.

Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations.
They've enlisted all their family.
They've enlisted all their friends.
It helped saved their relationship,
And made it work again

Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit.
There might even be a spin off, but they're not sure 'bout that.
If they ever watch T.V. again, it'd be too soon for them.
Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having too much fun.

Talking Heads,"I will fight; will fight with my heart.
I will fight; will fight with understanding.
In my mind, the weather never changes
Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A straight line exists between me and the good things.
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economize, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.

I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.",The Good Thing,1978

That he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal...
The change would be very subtle...It might take ten years or so...
Gradually his face would change its' shape...
A more hooked nose...wider, thinner lips...beady eyes...a larger forehead.
He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people...
They had also molded their faced according to some ideal...
Maybe they imagined that their new face would better
Suit their personality...Or maybe they imagined that their
Personality would be forced to change to fit the new appearance...
This is why first impressions are often correct...
Although some people might have made mistakes...
They may have arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them...

Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit.
There might even be a spin off, but they're not sure 'bout that.
If they ever watch T.V. again, it'd be too soon for them.
Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having too much fun.

And find it gone

From Germany and Europe
And Southern U.S.A.
They made this little town here
That we live in to this day

Saw Indians on TV
And heard about the legend
How their city was a dream

The dream it might come true

Dreams for sale
They sell 'em back to you

On with the show
Start the parade
We sand along
Sweep us away

It's political party time
Going down, going down
And the celebrities all come out
Coming down, coming down, coming...

The sun is going down
And the dogs are starting to howl
We stay out after dark
Eating cotton candy
And the music's playing...

How we all laughed!
We split our sides
The cameras flashed
We almost died!

Like an Adam and an Eve
Waterfalls

Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs
Cars have run on gasoline
Where, where have they gone?
Now, it's nothing but flowers

There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers

That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With a beautiful highway
This used to be real estate
Now it's only fields and trees
Where, where is the town
Now, it's nothing but flowers
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start over
But I guess I was wrong

Once there were parking lots
Now it's a peaceful oasis
You got it, you got it

This was a Pizza Hut
Now it's all covered with daisies
You got it, you got it

I miss the honky tonks,
Dairy Queens, and 7-Elevens
You got it, you got it

And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
You got it, you got it

I dream of cherry pies,
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies
You got it, you got it

We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
You got it, you got it

This was a discount store,
Now it's turned into a cornfield

Then we come to the farmlands, and the undeveloped areas
And I have learned, how these things work together
I see the parkway that passes through them all
And I have learned how to look at these things and I say

I wouldn't live there if you paid me
I wouldn't live like that, no Siree
I wouldn't do the things the way those people do
I wouldn't live there if you paid me to

I guess those people have fun with their neighbors and friends
Look at that kitchen and all of that food
Look at them eat it, I guess it tastes real good

Then they bring it to the stores
They put it in the car trunk

Bob is on the street today

They've enlisted all their friends

Their show gets real high ratings
They think they have a hit
There might even be a spin off
But they're not sure 'bout that

They ever watch TV again
It'd be too soon for them
Bob never yells about the picture now

Stands next to your love
I can't compel love

Talking Heads,"Lost my shape
Trying to act casual
Can't stop
I might end up in the hospital

Oh, I'm changing my shape
I feel like an accident
They're back
To explain their experience

Ah, hah, isn't it weird?
Sounds too absurd to me
Wasting away
And that was their policy

I'm ready to leave
I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost
Facts are never what they seem to be

Ah, nothing there
No information left of any kind
Lifting my head
Looking for the danger signs

And there was a line, there was a formula
Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us
There was a line, there was a formula
Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
Ah, ah, ah
I'm still waiting
Na, na, na, na, na

The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

The island of doubt
It's like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight
Got the message from the oxygen

Ooh, ah, making a list
Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right, right
Facts are useless in emergencies
Ah, ah, ah

The feeling returns
Whenever we close out eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them

Huh, still waiting

Talking Heads,"I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I want to know that you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is an ocean that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

I want to know that you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river, drop me in the water

Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't take no more of it

Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why I love you like I do
All the troubles you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I the biggest fool of them all

Tall Dwarfs,"Hello, Mr. Harrison;
I was just having coffee with my Mum.
Sorry to interrupt you and your wife--
I wondered if I could have your autograph

Meet the Beatle (x4)

It's funny, 'cause when I was five,
I waited for you to go by our drive.
And I know that guys like me are a drag--
You must have had it up to here with fans.

Meet the Beatle (x4)

So much of our lives just seem unreal
The way we are, and how we feel
I guess it's the same through the eyes
Of bigger people with bigger lives.

Tall Jazz,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream,2000
Tall Jazz,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,2000
Tall Jazz,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2000
