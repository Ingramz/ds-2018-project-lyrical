Broken Bells,"Walk out before you make it worse on yourself
Now's not the time for that elegant laugh
Digress from the people
Once by your side
Once by your side
But now that it's over
You have to pick up
And just start again, start again

Falling to earth
And you're calling it out
You're burning yourself and your challenge to winter
Gotta clip the lines and move for yourself
Just move for yourself, love
Now that it's over
You have to pick up
And just watch your back, watch your back

And close your eyes to us
Fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired
Longing to find

Learned that in time
You want it to end
Your life at this temperature
Life under water
You gotta let these fools all trample themselves
They trample themselves, just dying to enter
You're preaching to the choir
So turn around, turn around

And close your eyes to us
Fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired
Longing to follow

And close your eyes to us
And fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired
Longing to follow",Trap Doors,2010
Broken Bells,"What amounts to a dream anymore?
A crude device; a veil on our eyes
A simple plan we'd be different from the rest
And never resign to a typical life

Common fears start to multiply
We realize, we're paralyzed
Where'd it go, all that precious time?
Did we even try to stem the tide?

Why should we waste it on
Buying into the same old lies?
The longer we wait around
The faster the years go by

It's not too late
To feel a little more alive
Make our escape
Before we start to vaporize

Doubtless, we've been through this
So if you want to follow me you should know
I was lost then and I am lost now
And I doubt I'll ever know which way to go",Vaporize,2010
Broken Bells,"Look behind
Your head's on fire
Whirling masses
Rolling ashes
Keep on yawning
Career dawning
Life is tasteless
Folding paces

To turn away from the night
Allowing the light a low
He's surely fooling yourself
Leaving life on the shelf

You'll never know
How low an angry heart can go
How long a sitting hands return meant

Look behind
Your head's on fire
Whirling masses
Rolling ashes
Keep on yawning
Career dawning
Life is tasteless
Folding paces

Folding paces",Your Head Is on Fire,2010
Broken Bells,"And what you found was gold
As black as dried blood
The taste was so, so sweet
And one loves to love

The whole idea seems unfair to all
But it's always that way

So circles, crowds take in
Coincidental sun
And careful hands tie their knots
And you're dumb to be done

No, I'm not desolate enough
And heartless empire from
Where to end it

Those who search search by themselves
Leaving nothing to gain
Cast like stones into the night
We're all one and the same",Heartless Empire,2011
Broken Bells,"Cycle down in the belly of the ocean
Why he ever notice it as sucking up?
Rise up and sound this state
That everything else in this world can be broken

When the scolding flow closes the distance
Up from the devil then seeping out
Your tiny vengeful life might pass through my mind
But I blink and it's over

It's coming
Wait for it
Redawning
No contest
All of a sudden
Your Body and Soul
Will call a grave
You've been avoiding

This city
Your culture
Your modern
Day suffering
Is over
So what if
I love it
I can't help it
That's all

Several times in the glimpse of our intentions
I turned the stone and found a brand you light
I can form no more words as I cannot dare see no drama washing me over me

Will someone measure this moron now?
I'm back again in this one light town
I cut the tie and I don't have to rely on nothing no more

It's coming
Wait for it
Redawning
No contest
All of a sudden

Will call a grave

Broken Bells,"City dark, higher up, you notice
Set it up, leave it up, you're hopeless now
The whole world is treating you wrong

Pushing back 'cross the sand
Find a light between the system
But before we collide

All the world beyond the window
All the world beyond, you are

All the love up above
Tell the lights, I'm not to see it
Tight grip, empty hand
Otherwise we start to look in

Set it up, leave it up, you're hopeless now
The whole world is treating you wrong

City dark, higher up, you notice
Set it up, leave it up, you're hopeless now
The whole world is treating you wrong

In the night, you could run
Like a book between the pictures
And you look underground
For the light, detect the ridges

Broken Bells,"After your faith has let you down
I know you'll want to run around
And follow the crowd into the night
But after the disco
All of the shine just faded away
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time

'Cause I'm
Waiting here much too long and
Don't assume
That I need your love
The chill of night has got you dancing away
And I'm
Not the dreamer or the dream you're
Out there looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love?
And there's something wrong and it's sending you
Round and round 'til we go nowhere

I see the ashes on the ground
I know the world is burning down
And under the cold and empty moon
But after the disco
All of the shine just faded away
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
But you can't hide
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time

Broken Bells,"Leaning by the window, watch the dying of the sun
Balancing the weight of the pill on her tongue
She'll be getting that
Look in her eyes
Cold and lonely
But I don't know why

See her near the border
At the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Running out, keep running out

She found herself in a well full of men
Watching her slowly destroy all her plans
'Cause all along she won't allow herself to even dream about
The both of us enrolled in now
And it won't be long

The early morning sun
Is coming all around
Because waking up is hard enough when there's no one else around

See her near the border
At the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Running out, keep running out",The Angel and the Fool,2014
Broken Bells,"What did the storm wash away
Are you bailing out, out of the plans we've already made
It won't bother me now, and you know I'll be okay
You gotta lead your life, but you're not sure you know the way
Well you want to walk in white, you wanna sin but you're too shy
So the candle just keeps burning down on you

My cards are on the table, I'm here tonight
And I don't need anything from you
Down on the bowery, the changing lights
And I'll still be waiting here for you

I saw that look on your face
You don't need me now, and sometimes you wonder if it's off
Just another mistake, and why can't you just walk away
You gotta measure the cost, what do you gain, what have you lost
Lay off and wonder why, you wanna win but you won't fight
So the candle just keeps burning down on you

My cards are on the table, I'm here tonight
But I don't need anything from you
Down on the bowery, the changing lights
And I'll still be waiting here for you

Broken Bells,"Well it started as a game
Using pleasure, using pain
We got higher and higher that way
But it didn't work today

Even though it felt so right
Nothing's permanent in life
So it's useless to hold on so tight

Well you gotta
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
You lost control
'Cause nothing stays around too long

So now everything has changed
And your heart's been rearranged
Until nothing we've known here remains
And you say you shouldn't stay

As you're taking off your clothes
You think it's love and I suppose
It's just you endlessly needing control

Well you gotta
Give it up
Give it up

Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.

Burning in the cold
Waiting on the street for your man
You're trying not to look so

Holding on for life oh

Broken Bells,"I'm down by the fire
At the ocean side
Just waiting for that underwater world to say good night

Don't you hear that sound?
From that tide and send
They'll tell us to keep rowing and rowing if we can

So I've learned to keep my head in this lazy wonderland

Well you had to know
That I had to know
The tricks for us not to be found out
There's a place we can go
The trip is on but we can find a way

Tonight we'll go
Laughing all the way, my love
Tomorrow we'll go
Back in time to live today

To all the men who ride
In the morning light
Lying stubborn at the ending of another lovely night

And I've misplaced my mind, don't know how or why
And when it wonders back I hope it's still a friend of mine

Well you had to know
That I had to know
The tricks for us not to be found out
And there's a place that we can go
The trip is on but we can find a way

Tomorrow we'll go
Back in time to live today",Lazy Wonderland,2014

All this time I've never let you go
And ever since chains that had kept you into holding down my soul
I set you up, I gave you life
I try to act up fine, and
Now you knock me down, you shut me out
And I can see it in your eyes!
So, how you got it in your head,
That you can make it on your own!
You were sheltered, loved and fed,
But you just couldn't leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone

Leave it alone

Your heart was here, resting on my lap
And I'd do it all again,
But I'm never coming back!

Yet the snow's underground or underneath myself,
For me to leave it down the road
I've been all around the world,
But got nowhere to go

Broken Bells,"This ordinary room is turning
Into something of a prison, oh
And the only thing we know for certain
Is that don't nobody know

You think all of this is real
That's why you never try
To get it down or will it up
It's a shame

Hoo, haha, hoo, haha
Hoo, haha, hoo, haha

Not another lonely evening
When you stay you're not counting omens
When the morning isn't so disturbing actually
Just won't let it go

You think cutting gives you license (license)
To do anything at all (anything)
But you got to take your medicine (medicine)
To allow your hands to lose that grip and let it fall

Away

Left me wanting more

The ordinary life they want for you
Is it too much to have to bear?

But it's another way to win a useless fight
You've been lying so long from the way that you're faking
See the water run and rise
Just another day into a useless night
I've been pushing so hard that my hands are shaking
See the water run and rise

But I've been turned around
I was upside down
I thought love would always find a way
But I know better now
Got it figured out
It's a perfect world all the same

Using the meat and flesh, to consist of my meal,

Fetishes for organs sick thoughts within my brain.

I butcher and slaughter my fellow man,
I after the food chain with each sick plan,
Human meat fresh or from the grave,
Satisfies my insatiable cannibal crave

Some nights I dress in ornaments of flesh,
Beneath the night I dig for organs not so fresh,
The sight of a corpse makes me salivate,
I know I'm mentally sick, these thoughts aren't right,
Compelled to make use of the deceased,
For the craving on human meat I'll feast,
Dining upon my own related species,
Digesting the race of man into my feces.

No longer, a living mortal being,
Fate sealed, perpetual darkness all you're seeing.

Then another soul eternally digest,
Into this dark gods gullet of the damned,
Afterlife unfortunately is just
Another different hell.

He pushes inside, they cry as their anus rips,
From their tender lips his unholy semen drips,
Sodomizing boys within the house of God,
Screaming as they rectally accept his prod,
Withdrawing his bloody penis now hard as a rock,
He takes a page of scripture and with it wipes his cock,
He quotes the Bible to his daily congregation,
His buttocks bleed from the choir boys flagellation,

Bursting vessels in my body,
Saturated, disfigured and swollen,
Caught by the current there is no escaping,
Lodged under a log entangled in seaweed,
Sand encrusts every orifice,
Covered with silt in an unmarked watery grave,
Settling upon the bottom I lay upon the sand,
Fish gnaw away at my lips,

Outside such a woman, yet inside she was dead.

We kissed and touched heavily, our passion grew hot,
Seconds later between her legs I began to finger rot.
My digits swam inside her collapsing vaginal walls,
Moaning with sick ecstasy, she caressed my shrunken balls.

My hand pulled out ovaries, and uterus wrapped my fist.

Where the pathogenesis began no one will know.

Female organ structures in decomposing states,

I spread her withered labias, they split, ripped and broke,
Douching internal mortis, on gangrenous feminine odor I choke.

And see that every move I make is a dance just for your gaze
That every single action is a means not to an end

So paint me, take me, hate me, claim me make me something more
Something better than the black and white that coloured me before
I want to feel your body and your hands upon my chest
To feel my emptiness

So bury me beneath the pines
In the shallow soil
In the filth and grime
And still this heart will yearn for you

So I've hatched upon a plan, a scheme of dervish wit
A pilot light to guide me through the caverns of your heart
I take this knife upon myself and gouge a shallow track
Until you love me back

All the time I stand by myself

Tryin to fool myself out
The only thing that you see

Bruised she feels
Insecure and jilted
Like a thief he tried to steel her soul
Slyer than his easy smile
He tried to use her for a while
Underneath she's empty as a whole

Oh flame's still burning
She's not learning
Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

Loaded with ammunition
Coded by her ambition
He fires a sweet talk into defenseless she
Shot and numb with poison words
She struggles uselessly
Unhurt a slave to his cruel captivity

Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

It's all a game
For him to play
He trank a deep
And threw her away
Deluding her
No illusion is numb

Cynicism neared his head
And left his appetite
Unfed
Alone all his brilliant words
Are dead

Oh flame's still burning
She's not learning
Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

He turned her world to black
But she's stopped looking back
Tattooed it all in black
Discretion is the key
To his reality
And she feels now she's free
So she chooses then and there
To leave without a care
She goes into the dusk
As easy as a breeze
No longer on her knees
Her soul is now at peace",Flame,

En lo ancho de una cama

El cielo en mil pedazos

Rejected for no reason
He finds it easy to cry
Another day that pases
How he tries to hide
Confused with how he's feeling
Ends up wanting much more
Waits for the bell to ring
But no-one's at the door.
Living in a jail house
A cell of his own
Will he ever have his freedom
Inside of his home?
And the warden is his father
The watcher his mum
Under lock and key
Until he's 21

Uncertain where he's going
Uncertain of his love
Uncertain what is coming
Is this the punishment for love?

They gave him everything he wanted
And a little bit more
But nothing seems to please him
He stares at the floor
Watching from the window
His friends passing by
Wishing he could be there (never satisfied)
Living in a jailhouse
A cell of his own
Will he ever have his freedom
Inside of his home
The judge it is his father
The jury his mum
He'll just have to serve his sentence
Until he's 21

Well you know
Time waits for no-one
Got a pace of it's own
The dawning of an idea
To go it alone
Longing for adventure
Fear of the unknown
Trying to find the courage
Make a break of his own
Fleeing from that jailhouse
His heart full of hope
There's a ride waiting for him
To take him to the smoke

To get away

Want me to do
Keep hearing rumours
About our love
I can't go on
I've had enough

It just keeps me rolling on

From the burdens of the planet earth

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006

Cast the first stone and begin the violence
Let man whose words ring true
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence
Let the one's who lose their way
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine
Let the one's who chose to stray
Recognize the price they'll pay in their lifetime

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine

Sitting here, waiting for my roads to cross
You nailed me down and you watched me bleed
So lay my head against the earth
Plant my body like a seed
You can't always get the things you want, love
Get what you deserve and maybe what you need
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love
Turn the soil and plot the weed

I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A.
But now he's waiting tables cause their's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he been blessed
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

Knew what I wanted, she was up in the cut
Swinging that butt, like race you out here
Only rapped the benz, and rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearing, champagne waving
Jewels around the neck, live style she's craving
Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending
If you do the lending, she'll do the bending
Straight machine vending, it's money for take
Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow

For the ends, rats snitch on one another

Making money on the block, kids was on they jock
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run

And holdin' weight, goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and golds, and got no job
And then one did some kid, and one got robbed

Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers,
we coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride,
and hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off,
and coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?

""Say yep, my whole darn family's here
We gotta have a home, gotta have a home""

He said ""Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
'Cause you see if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through
Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home""

""You better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton
Heh, you can't even buy gasoline

Dream of worlds full of toys,
This time of the year,
When Christmas is near.

Evergreens are snowy white,
Sleigh bells ring through the night,
This time of the year,
When Christmas is near.

And somewhere near a steeple,
People kneel and pray,
And choirs sing,
Carols of Christmas day.

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not

And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes it was my way",My Way,1986

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

Brook Benton,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme

And all that I needed (real commitment)
I really couldn't see it (not a real man)
You said you be there (in this relationship)
So many men (these men) think that all a girl (they think)
Needs is to be sold a dream, but I want
For real

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You trippin' more
I'm tired of you playing
Got me lookin' at the front door missing
You're missing more to let you play me
Don't wanna play house no more, no more
I'm tired of you playing
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, gizeppi's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me
Cryin', cryin', cry, cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

I miss you so bad tonight
You were the one
Who loved me and held me and tried
In every way, I miss you¡­so bad tonight

Where do I go, when I am so alone?
Who will touch my hair, and take this pain away?
I don't want to talk, I just want someone who knows me

That you are the sum

Everything else around me will fade to the background
And I'll be struck full by the truth in your gaze
As you work an indelible change in me

'cause I know that you'll lift me out

Have your way here
Keep me afloat 'cause I know I'll sink without you
Take this ocean of pain that is mine
Throw me a lifeline

Wake up feeling convicted
I know something's not right
Re-acquaint my knees with the carpet
I have to get this out
'cause it's obstructing you and I
Dry up the seas that keep us parted

'cause they've been swimming in the wrong waters
And now they're pulling me down
But I am clinging to you, never letting go
'cause I know that you are gonna pull me out

Will continue a few days yet, a few days yet

I'm over now, I'm through

I'm hanging here just reminiscing
About all the things you said to me
Hoping you plan on returning to interrupt my reverie

You're sweet, sweeter than honey tea
You're precious and worth more than gold to me
I know I acted selfishly
Come on home

I'll beg and plead if you need me to
I'm head over heels over feet for you
Gonna have you wed by the end of this tune
Well, I hope...

If there's a good and bad we're somewhere in between

Could we get a change of pace to set the scene

We could stay another day in this confusion
Let it permeate us 'till we can't move on

[Chorus]
And while we're waiting we could try saving the world
Or are we storing that up for a rainy day?
I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn
It could be fun to try
I think that I'll save the world as a fun afternoon activity

Seventy thousand things to ponder today
The most significant are bottom of the list
Forty five million recipes and ways
To exaggerate and compound the stress

We could stay another day in this apathy
Let it permeate us 'till we're numb through

Ooh............

And while we're waiting we could try saving the world
Or are we storing that up for a rainy day?
I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn

Finally you can breathe
Nobody knows your name

Gently expose what's underneath

Is the scarlet in the day
Even it's real
You can't stay

You're gone for good
There you go
You're gone for good

From months of thought without release
They've taken their toll on you

Of timid and fragile honesty
Is precious and rare and fleeting

I'm thriving on my self-sufficiency
I'm not listening to the things I've heard
About me and you

People think there must be something to the way
I talk about you every chance I get
But if I think about you night and day
Doesn't mean I'm ready yet

Maybe I am knee-deep in denial
Or maybe I'm just trying to move on
Maybe I should keep away awhile
But if distance is right I'd rather be wrong

'cause I love the way you're smiling at me
When you know it's true
I'm still in love with you
And I love the way you're really trying
Not to let me see
You're still in love with me too

I am way to proud to verbalise my feelings
And you are way to mean if you just let this brew
It's a complicated hand that you've been dealing
Time to win me over: fold and make your move

Smooth some calm over this situation
I can't get past the way I feel for you
It's the little things that make this worth the effort
It's the small, little, insignificant things you do

That make me love the way you're glancing, hoping
When you know it's true
I'm still in love with you
And I love that I'm barely coping

In which to whittle away the hours

We could drive 'til we've run out of road
We could drink 'til we've emptied the ocean

Happy just to hold you

Now I know that it's the real thing
Just try and keep me quiet about it

We could fall 'til gravity gets tired
We could lose our love just to re-find it

Even if that means infinity through
If being productive is being with you

toward home,a land that I've never seen
I am changing: less and less asleep
made of different stuff than when i began
and i have sensed it all along
fast approaching is the day

[Chorus]
when the world has fallen out from under me
I'll be found in you, still standing
when the sky rolls up and mountains fall on their knees
when time and space are through
I'll be found in you

Theres distraction buzzing in my head
saying in the shadows it's easier to stay
but I've heard rumors of true reality
whispers of a well-lit way

You make all things new

Brooke Fraser,"Your eyes are full
Full of the future of us
The air changes as you look across
At me in that wondering way

It is as if
I knew you before we spoke
Do our hearts know something we don't?
Conspiring, converging without giving us any say

[Chorus]
You, sing me to sleep
Talk down my walls
Look through my windows as I wait
You could be the thief
I give the key to

You're ruining me
With secrets and gestures and looks
With sonnets from second-hand books
Playing the chords in me nobody knew how to play

[Chorus]

It fits in your hand like water in rain
It unlocks our two different selves
And shows we are the same
Rather than wait 'til I put me out for the taking

You're breaking
You're breaking into my heart
And I'm letting you",The Thief,2006

You got your Y.S.L. kicks and a red birthmark

That you try to keep a secret

You got a quick clack walk and a cold hard stare
And if your eyes could talk they'd say they just don't care
Before they wander off
To hide inside their sockets

You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks
You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey
You've got your secrets
You've got your regrets

You got a fool-proof plan for a lonely life

It's you that's hidden by the expectations
We want to see you, won't you show us where to start?
You're talking trash with your red liquor lips
It's you that tickle in the conversation

Still beats and still marches on

Oh, Annie
I will think of you each time I see the sun
Didn't want a day without you
But somehow I've lived through another one

A gentlemen waits on a platform in a haze of gray and grief
Now he's sold up his assets, starting over at seventy
The steam blasts like trumpets around him
Salutes on the colonnade
As he thinks to himself,
""We're all waiting for our train to come""

Oh, Annie
I will think of you each time I see the sun
Didn't want a year without you
But somehow I've lived through another one

Did you find it hard to breathe at first?
Were you wounded and in disbelief at how much it hurt?
Now the ache's still burning, but the world's still turning

Left her youth near Sausalito

Better or worse but what else can we do

If it's not either of us tell me who are we fooling

I tired of trying to guess what was wrong
Both agreed on where we should go, but not how to get there
We tried and tried to loosen the knots
Thinking once we're untangled we'll be better off
But it's these failures and faults that hold us together

Previews of the mornings layin' in all lazy.

Heed your own warning

It took a little while to find reality
We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream
Waking to find that we are kings and queens

The memories stay
They loop their lies on endless replay, oh

Been sleeping where I fall if I can sleep at all
'Cause I wake where I wanna if I wake at all

And we're chasing down tomorrow

They'll trick your mind and turn your heart to stone

Forget the wars we fight, forget the tears you cry

To see the edges fade between the light and shade
And we're chasing down forever, oh

Don't think that we should stall
It's in your eyes
I can see
You want to ask
But you don't have the nerve
Here's my invitin' accept
I know ya got the urge

No need in leavin' early
You found somebody to move with
Ain't no need of lookin' around
I'm standin' in front of your face
Don't try to fight the feelin'
We've got to live in the moment
I'm ready whenever you say so

You don't have to dance alone
Not here
My arms are open wide
I'm here for you
So take my hand
Don't dance alone
This song was made for us
And don't hesitate to come and meet me

There ya go
Sittin' down
Tryin' to keep ya cool
But you hear the rhythm callin' you
It's callin' me
You ain't got nothin' to lose
A spotlight's shinin' on us both
The time is now
You got a life to live
Don't let this moment pass us by
Live tonight
We got a show to give

No need in leavin' early
You found somebody to move with
Ain't no need of lookin' around

Brooke Hogan,"Lately I've been thinking about the ups & downs
We've been through together and how we almost lost our ground
We held on long enough to see all the good out weigh the bad
And I'm thankful, so grateful for everything we have
But for a moment I thought I lost everything
For a moment I forgot about our memories
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me

My first love, my first kiss I shared both of them with you
From the first time we locked eyes I knew you and I would be the truth
But since then you've lied to me and I've lied to you
But we made up and I'm thankful so grateful
For everything we have
So beautiful that's what we are
I'm your sky and your my star
All the trials that we've been through
Only made us who we are today

But for a moment I thought I lost everything
For a moment I thought forgot about our memories
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me

Your connected to everything and everybody that matters to me
Your the center all my charm without I wouldn't be
I thought I lost my best friend
My perfect world came to an end
But it was just a dream that felt like reality

But for a moment I thought I lost everything
I thought I lost my baby
I forgot about our memories
Then I opened my eyes
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me
I thought I lost you and me",For a Moment,2006

Brooke Hogan,"I think I'm going to take it slow
And tell you the things that are on my mind
Then you can drop me off at home for the last time
I only wanted you to know that
I always had the best of intentions

Look at what you put me through
Anything I would have done for you
But it's not how it used to be
When you and I were hooked on each others dreams
Got stuck in reality and you couldn't
Make everything feel alright
When I gave you the best of me I never
Thought you'd give me a reason
To tell you I'm leaving I ran out of
Patience when you started changing
And there's no tears left to cry
Kept on hoping we could find a way to make it real
And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
And I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

Now I'm not trying to regret anything
I that have done or the things I have said
Life has a way of change like the season
Summer, spring, winter and fall
Sometimes I feel all alone I wish
You were there on special occasions
Feelings for you I cant hide but
I know better than to drop my pride

But it's not how it used to be
When you and I were hooked on each others dreams
Got stuck in reality and you couldn't
Make everything feel alright
When I gave you the best of me I never
Thought you'd give me a reason

And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
And I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

I've made up my mind (i've made up my mind)
No more tears to cry (now there's no tears left to cry)
I didn't believe you each and every time
You said you changed I knew that things would stay the time
It would only be right if I went on with my own life

Kept on hoping we could find a way to make it real
And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
You know I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

Its alright I don't want another try
Cause I'm letting go

Brooke Hogan,"Yo baby what's up?

I been around him and I know what he's about
Shinin' those fancy things but its not what he's made out of
He takes good care of me and loves me when I'm down
He's my best friend to me and damn he makes me proud

So now I'm feelin' like I'm choked up
Wrote you a text yea we broke up
I tried to settle some things but now that games done
I see your face red you're gettin' wasted
You play with fire it'll get you like you're k-fed
We on the record baby you got a second maybe
And y'all know who I am sorry chelsea lately
Let's teach it as a lesson man you fall from heaven
This redemption is the only thing my mind's stressin'.

And I'm fallin' for him I'm fallin' in love
I never thought I'd fall in love I never thought I'd fall in,
And I'm fallin' for him I'm fallin' in love
I never thought I'd fall in love I never thought I'd fall in

When life is hard on him he wants me by his side
When I lie next to him he holds me through the night
I'll build a life for him I'll keep him safe and warm
When he comes home to me I'll be right at the door.

And now I'm knocking at your door miss
Open up looking gorgeous fly from head to toe
She smiles a metamorphosis
Sunshine shines the clouds can run their course when
we set sail everything is in orbit
Fight but never forfeit who knows you best
Lets take an overseas trip on my private jet
And like that we reconnect eyes and spirit
I'm fallin' deep for your love and I don't care who hear it

And I'm fallin' for him I'm fallin' in love
I never thought I'd fall in love I never thought I'd fall in,
And I'm fallin' for him I'm fallin' in love
I never thought I'd fall in love I never thought I'd fall in

Baby you don't know how much I need you
You know I would give up everything to be with you
Got me crazy wanna break you off (sometimes)
And baby I love you and I don't deserve you

Brooke Lambkin,"When I was young, I walked in the way of the world
I did everything I was told
By the enemy of my soul
Like so many, so many who'd gone before me

And I got tired, tired of the lies I was
Tired of the wall I kept hitting
So tired of my sin
'Til a voice called to me and He called me blessed

And He said, ""Come, come, come, lay down your burdens""
Come to the Lord and the Lord will give you rest
Yeah so I come, I come, I come and lay down my burdens
I come to the Lord and the Lord is my rest

Now that I'm walking, not in the way of the world, 
I'm walking on in the way of the Word, 
Walking on in the light of the Lord
Like my brothers and my sisters who've gone before me

And I get tired, I'm tired of the battle raging on
Oh, but His grace, His grace makes me strong
And His voice calls to me
And He calls me blessed

And He says, ""Come, come, come, lay down your burdens""
Come to the Lord and the Lord will give you rest
Yeah so I come, I come, I come and lay down my burdens
I come to the Lord and the Lord is my rest

So if you have burdens, if you're hurting, 
You can lay it all at the foot of the cross, yes you can
Where Jesus came and He ransomed the lost
And He's calling you blessed

And He says, ""Come, come, come, lay down your burdens""
Come to the Lord and the Lord will give you rest
Yeah so I come, I come, I come and lay down my burdens
I come to the Lord and the Lord is my rest

And we hear holiness whisper the sweet amen of peace
We will follow You, and we will sing

It's not with earthly weapons
Or the roll of stirring drums
But with deeds of love and mercy
Your kingdom comes, oh let Your kingdom come

And lead on, O King eternal
We will follow You, not with fears

Brooke Miller,"I could not stay sleeping, oh, my mind would not allow
And suddenly all these thoughts on life crept into me somehow
The sun has barely risen to lay aside another night
And it's here I settle softly into every word I write

Maybe I'm just counting up my sheep too late
But I just let them run beyond the fence
What good are guards that wouldn't give such pleasure?

I think I'll have a morning, one that starts out with a laugh
In the hopes that it would spread out equal on behalf
Of an unforgiving measure, oh where find time just ticks away
To let the simple things bring you closer in a simple way",Am Song,2007
Brooke Miller,"Bring down the rain bring out the ghosts
It's twenty-five degrees out on the West Coast
Every thing's in bloom there and I don't care
I've been thinking about leaving too

You pack as little as you can 'cause that's what you do
You put everything in storage and give the dog to mom
She wouldn't mind there's a big back field
A long time ago they stopped turning yield

You should see the view there from up on the hill
I fell in love with the train last week and everyone there
I got the scent of everyone's laughter in my hair
We watched the landscapes click by hell I was the engineer

I saw the country from the dome car and I was outta here
By night we traveled slow, by day we went fast
And no one checked to see where we were on the map
You knew you hit the prairies and you knew why

You take a deep breath and hold it in
And every deep breath seems to quiet the din
You forget about the time zones, there are none out there
Home for the reckless home for the race
It's home for a moment of time and space

You learn the rails and you're learning on the tracks

And a village comes together seven coaches long",Country from the Dome Car,2007

And clinging to my knees
You may not know it babe
But you've been helping me

I've been in deep waters
Searching for some change
I've got dreams like the weather
And habits just as strange
Oh, oh, oh

You don't find it in writing
When the heart does so much talking
That the dialogs becomes a way of rhyme
We could go on weighing
Our peace in good measures
We still would have run out of time

So don't weigh your body down
If you wanna shout it out loud
I will be your ears
And I would tell you I'm so proud

Of our love up to the last
How it all flipped by so fast
Give us both chance to rise
After a fall like this
Oh, oh, oh

I wish you all that you could wish for
All that you can hold
But this love is deeper waters
To no mold

Brooke Miller,"Yesterday the circus left town in a suitcase
Rimmed with little key chain hearts
And they tore those giant tents down

Lions in the pouring rain
And the birds in the pouring rain
Ohm but my heart belongs to the bearded woman
Who had a glory bound lonely gaze

She used to fit her head
Inside an elephant's mouth
With some kind of solitude grace

When you find it, oh you better use it up
You better hold on to it
Like it's an answer to your prayers

Spring is coming early this year, you can tell
'Cause everybody's got their old jobs back
No one stays too long around here
They left circles in the wide back fields

And the farmers tried to cover up the scars
You can still run your hands over soft black earth
And wonder where they are
Oh but my son left for the fields today

He's a fourth generation
Works good with his hands
Got his mother's cheeks and a big brass heart
And boy he loves to work that land

Out on the streets in my new city
You can see where shadows
Make prints on the pavement
They know when the Salvation Army truck
Comes around

Lions in the pouring rain
And they're birds in the pouring rain
They hold their cups
Out by the side of the circus tent doors

Between the bank and the HMV
But you never hear
The rattle on a rich man's coat
Who's got it locked up with a key",Hold on to It,2007
Brooke Miller,"I always wonder where you came from
And you always say Mars
I noticed one day my life was missing something
And then there you are

In your shiny Martian suit
With a ship by your side
I was wearing my heart on my sleeve
You were wearing a star

I can't help but feel the luckiest
Of anyone here
Was it so beautiful on your planet
That you wanted me there

Before you know it
We're in it one year deep
Tell me why do you want
To go out living in disguise?

You always show me love with open arms
And I always give in
I would have charmed you back from China
Or from the Pisces fin

And how I am swept away
By your mission to change the world
And I know that you've changed
One world here for sure

Before you know it
We're in it two years deep
And I know that you've changed
One world here for sure

Brooke Miller,"The plot gets thicker and it always goes astray
You're never holding in your hands a particular play
You're not satisfied with the taste or smell
And it's not what you ordered, well

There's a good chance some body else has got it made
Well, there's trouble where you seek it
You see it in store windows
And the box is twice as big as the item

There's a spotlight shining from the corner both night and day
Some gather round and paw the glass
Others who know better pass
And they whisper to themselves, they'll never find their way
With stars in their eyes, they'll never find their way

There's trouble where you seek it
You don't have to go sneaking around
To find they've found you out by now
There's trouble where you seek it

You're opening cans with your teeth
Chewing on the grizzle, trying just to have some cake
Toying with intentions, undoing what you make
It's hard to chew the fat, harder to swallow
Under every bit of bone is the last bit of marrow
There's trouble where you seek it",Trouble Where You Seek It,2007
Brooke Miller,"I had first realized the shape I was in
After six years in uniform, in the standing din
I signed in at eighteen for a college degree
Recruiting out of high school into opportunity

I'd always equated my love for my land
With the loyalty of the army but now I understand
I'm from a small town, I knew quiet streets
There was a market where people often meet

I built my home there, me and my family
These are the loneliest days I've seen
My soldiers are marching according to rank
They have occupied the borderlines outside the West Bank

I'm relieving my attention on a bloody red machine
A conscientious citizen for the democratic regime
This kind of struggle's not one to go alone
So I'm joining the opposition but I'm never going home

I'm from a small town, no cause and no elites
There was a market where people often meet
I remember loved ones but I don't remember peace
These are the loneliest days I've seen",Two Soldiers,2007
Brooke Miller,"What kind of move is the best thing
For leaving you in the I don't know
You can leave the best of a cool nest
But there's no master plan when you go
You hear the swearing and the laughter
Smoke coming in from the neighbors next door

My Christina had the toughest set of lungs
She could out sing anyone
She'd have them up on the small floor dancing
Anyone knew anyone
I hate to be leaving in the middle of this
What can I say but

This city is chorded there's rhythm in the traffic
Spokes in the wheels wherever you go
I'm just one exception to be sitting here
Trying to carve out some kind of a home

Everyone around here lets their cats loose
To control the mice
It's the kind of neighborhood with a few broken down houses
But it's kinda nice

Going through photos of places you've been
The places you part
It's the packing and the moving that really holds on
To the rungs of a lonely heart

Just when you think it's over
Something new begins
Somewhere in the grander scheme of scheming
Just when you think you're stepping out
That's when you're stepping in
It leaves you open windowed and ever dreaming",What Kind of Move,2007

You are a yellow caution light and a yield sign
And I'm building tall fences to protect this heart of mine

Was it so much difficulty cutting that glass?
You didn't think it would last
And after twenty-two years
I'm not doing so bad at all

I guess it don't matter if the joke's on me
You have me at your beck and call
And to tell you the truth
I really don't mind at all

Change, change, change
There's a different address every time
And I've got plenty of practice
And I know you don't mind

I'm home in the country or here in the park
I stumble where ever you land
Have mercy on my timing, it's out of my hands
You want the world on a whim and the sky below

You really walk the line
But I bet you miss it when every thing's fine
I guess it don't matter if the joke's on me
You have me at your beck and call

And to tell you the truth, I really don't mind at all
What would I ever do if you left me here alone?
I would need a come back to a dial tone",World on a Whim,2007
Brooke Miller,"They'll be wondering how this all came about
And silly rumors will fly around this little town
But I don't care, I know it's in the air
How much I adore you

I've been singing about water
Without a second foot on dry ground
You make swimming so easy I'm gonna drown
In your capping blues and greens
I mean who gets to feel this way

But it's a quiet revolution in the way that you love me
You set the sky high above me
And the heart can travel given the right set of wings
You can see everything

It's a quick turn the corner back into prolific
You take the summer off jotting things down
That you hope will come back to ya
It's ain't easy when you're the only thing that's on my mind
It's the kindest storm blowing in a bigger love

We are living in the eye of what most only dream of
There is a will without the weight and here we are today
Give me something I'm not revealing
You came barreling 'round the corner silver wheeling
Lit by a match of recognition and recall
It wouldn't take long to fall",You Can See Everything,2007
Brooke Morton,"Everybody's callin' it a real big shame
She keeps lettin' him treat her that way
He's older and he's wild
She's such a pretty child
He must be thinkin' 'bout one thing
But there are stars in her eyes
'Cause she's thinkin' he might
Give her that class ring

[Chorus]
She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love

Daddy knows his baby's headed for a heartache
And that part of growin' up is learnin' from mistakes
But he can't let her go
Cause he knows
That boy's nothin' but bad news
But daddy can't control her
She's getting older
There's nothin' anyone can do
She might get hurt along the way
But she's gettin' older
There's nothin' anyone can do
She might get hurt along the way
But she's gonna find true love someday
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved!
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first, oh, how I first believed

Now when we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun!
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun!

It is the night

Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Used to love you
Now I hate you
You hate me too
Would have walked on hot coals for you
Now I don't care spit about you

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead

I pawned your jewelry on the net
Called up your boss told him you quit
Must have been breast fed
Fell on your head
You'd be better
Slicing your wrists
Think you'll ever leave me for her
Revenge is sweet but I

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead

Used to love me and hug me and tell me you need me
Hold me gently, I was sure of everything
But now you've changed you're my worst enemy
I'd rather see you in the cemetery
Gagging, boxed up, full of maggots
Rotten bones in a wooden casket
But now I'm calm and cool about this
Some hopeful thinking never hurt anyone

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead

I've always been right here 
So, don't you try to deny 
I've been right by your side 

Then you started to tell the truth 
About all the girls you knew 
I was already over heels for you 
I just don't know what to do 

Oh, I, I try but I can't shake you 
Oh, I, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you 

[Chorus]
Leave me alone, stay out late, but don't even call 
As long as you come home. 
Tell me you love me, when you don't at all 
As long as you come home 
Say you were, when you wasn't hangin' out with your boys 
As long as you come home 
Boy, you do, you will, you won't, or you don't 
As long as you come home 

Come tell me all of those sweet lies 
You used to whisper in my ear 
I don't wanna fight 
I just want you near 

Don't need my girls telling me 
How stupid I am 
Want everybody just to let me be 
I'm staying with my man 

Oh, I, I try but I can't shake you 
Oh, I, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you.

He had a cute little booty

And say, ""Hey boy, you lookin' kinda cute
Won't you slip me them digits on the cool
Wanna hook up with you real soon
Hope I ain't too aggressive for you, babe""

There's a first for everything

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket, the aftermath
More bodies being buried,  I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin'', my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me

Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Ever'day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin'
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking

The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this suppression
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen

(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in 2000)

Never too complex to where it fly
Over the heads of 85, I strive
To stay real and keep hip-hop alive
Revive thoughts collide, you better slide I advise
You keep the eyes on the prize, my metal rips
Militant minded like the prejudice devils I shatter
This march was meant to spark a million diligent hearts
Or e'rylife, we even see alike so play your part

Knowledge equality, born gods can follow me
As we swarm the yard like bees out in D.C.
The TV'll televise the revolution for sellin lies
Within the constitution, realise the former solution
October 16th, a million black minds comin intertwined on the fact find
Lord Jamal, black Jesus and I stack rhymes
But the black-on-black crime that attack mine

[Chorus]
So where you at why'all?
 Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at why'all?
 Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

Hear my synopsis, I drop this
Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out
Society inflaws unjust laws remain the voided common cause
Equality rules you to love that equality
Many's law to trust this
Act of the devil possess the sword of justice
Take the devil's head through levels and bad truth can spread to mental dead

Imagine us traveling back to Nazareth
 Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
 When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
 No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall of the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the thirty million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is revelations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

[Chorus]

Yo around Red (16) October
BROOKLYN ZOO attack like cobra
Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
The darkside, I ride tracks to provide
Elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons 'cause I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide through the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene nahmean?
But I've been knockin em out the box like ????
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
And mould me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart with the million man march

Brooks & Dunn,"When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

There's a rundown bar
Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of this neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams

Here you come turnin' all that around

Jokin' about my broken heart

With or without the salt on it

Found her memory in some mescal haze
Lost my mind while the guitar played

I'm gonna carry this burden way out west
Find a way to lay this hurt to rest
Live it up 'til I live her down
Lost in tequila town

Left her standing in a tear-stained dress
I cursed the day that I confessed
Wayward sins of a mortal man
Watched the ring come off her hand

Looking back on all I've lost
Price I've paid ain't worth the cost
I'll run this road until it ends
And maybe find my way back to her again

I know how you feel 
Are you all out of love

The story in your eyes
Tells me the well's run dry
Am I a fool for holdin' on
For prayin' this feeling's wrong
If what I fear
Is really true
Then girl
I want to hear it from you
Are you all out of love
Are you all out of love

Is this the end of the line
Is this as far as we go
Or can I somehow change your mind
Or will your heart be forever closed

Are you all out of love",All Out of Love,1999

Brooks & Dunn,"I woke up in the front yard
In the back seat of a buick
With the lights and the radio on
I stumbled 'cross the grass
To the front porch through the door
Of a house that once was our home
If love once lived here you can't tell it
If I could just let go I'd sell it
Oh, I'm goin' under gettin' over you

Made my way down the hall
Through the boxes to the bed
Where I used to hold you all night long
Your perfume on the pillow
Where you once laid your head
Stays there to remind me you're gone
It's gonna tear me apart if I let it
I should just move on and forget it
But, I'm goin' under gettin' over you

The days are long and the nights are tough
All alone it's just too much

Last call farewell

A hundred tons of cold steel
Rustin' in the rain
The singin' of the rollin' wheels
Are callin' out her name
That whistle keeps blowin'
That high lonesome sound
It tells me where I'm goin'
Is gonna be a long way down

I guess I've run out of the right things to say

But baby tomorrow when you wake up

Just remember when he looks at you
He don't see what I see
That little girl smile, that woman in your eyes
That always got to me
Just remember when you turn down the lights
Who you're really reachin' for
Yeah he can tell you he loves you but I love you more

I was the one that told you he loved you
You were afraid you couldn't be loved
I was the one who you could believe
Would never leave when times got tough
I'll never say I told you so

I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here and your miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking

I ain't missing you
Since you've been gone, away
I ain't missing you

Brooks & Dunn,"It was a foggy mornin' south of San Jose
We were sittin' in a crowded coffee shop
With nothin' left to say
My cup grew cold and a teardrop rolled
Down her cheek and I brushed it away
I remember it all just like yesterday

[Chorus]
And I see it now, I feel it still
It's a day I can't forget and never will
And I hear her voice on the winds of Abilene
She used to call me Texas and I called her Norma Jean

Still see her wavin' through the radiator steam
She was stranded by the roadside on her way to bigger things
She threw her bags in back, said she liked my hat
Her name was Marilyn Justine
I fell into her California dream

[Chorus]

Yeah we took a lotta detours on our winding way out west
Livin' for the moment, forgettin' all the rest
The life that she had waitin' and the one I left behind
And now I'm back here tryin' to sort it out
One fence post at a time

In that coffee shop, the road just stopped
And we faced reality
The place that she was goin' had no place for me

[Chorus]

Yeah I called her Norma Jean",Texas and Norma Jean,1999
Brooks & Dunn,"She said,
Out with the boys don't cut it no more
And ""I'm sorry"" is just noise, she's heard it all before
Said that ring on her finger, well it feels like prison
She's talked 'til she's blue, and I don't listen

[Chorus]
I went too far this time,
Crossed over that line,
I'm past the point of no return
Livin' proof some fools never learn
Well I pushed my luck, now she's givin' up
Somethin' tells me I went too far this time

She said,
Save your breath boy, I've heard it all,
And keep your place there with your back to the wall,
Said I'm leavin' you lonely 'cause I've had my share
Save those worn out ""I love you's"" for someone that cares

Wonderin' how I let her go
Did I hold her too tight, heaven only knows

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with angels
That's the trouble with angels
You can try and make her stay
But she's bound to fly away
That's the trouble with angels

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I hope you'll always understand
I'm savin' you a soft place to land
It's crazy I know talkin' like you're still so close

So much out there

Brooks & Dunn,"Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me

There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)

Your smile, your lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
