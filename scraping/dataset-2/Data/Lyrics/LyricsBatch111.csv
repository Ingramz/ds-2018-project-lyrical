Dave Dudley,"I knew the state of ol' Wisconsin back when I was eight
I sang all over Minneapolis lookin' for a break
I rode the rapid rivers with the Chiquoia Indian tribe
I traveled on my thumb though it injured my pride
I'm the world's worst world's first go-while-you-can original traveling man
The world's best forget the rest one night stand original traveling man

I've traveled down to Nashville just a looking for a song
I've traveled down to Mexico just a looking for a home
I guess I've got a self-winding watch for a mind
I start runnin' down if I ain't movin' all the time
I'm the world's worst world's first

I've traveled in a PT boat and fought for Uncle Sam
I've been as close to death as any living man
I've traveled in a limousine and I've traveled in a truck
I've traveled by myself ma'm but thank you very much
I'm the world's worst world's first
Hey I'm the world's worst world's first",Original Traveling Man,1972
Dave Dudley,"Wish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop I still dream about that
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top reckon they never will
Now corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get that corn from a jar
Rocky Top you'll always be

I've had years of cramped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life can't get simple again
Rocky Top you'll always be",Rocky Top,1972
Dave Dudley,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,1973
Dave Dudley,"I was riding this eighteen-wheeler before those fading lights
Never paid much money cause I couldn't make much time
There used to be a running battle between old Smokey and me
But now I got a six-foot Shakespeare me and old CB

Well tonight I got the front door can't always have the rocking chair
Pig Pen's got that back door closed just told me on the air
Just checked out the westbound and Road Hawk says she's clean
Looks like a money making run for me and old CB

Ace the blue-eyed Indian still runs with Single Drive
Old Single Drive is a ratchet jaw but he keeps the night alive
And Jolly Jack at Beaver Dust checking covers on the seat
We looking for a red Pinto me and old CB

There goes Circle City Peddler boy he's getting fat
He make is turn in Derby Town I couldn't live like that
The Chicken Coop is open and so is D.O.T.
Appreciate the info Cisco me and old CB

The California Devil he's down at marker 25

He just hollered breaker, breaker man them bushes are alive
So comb your hair their taking pictures down at 23
We'll give them a great big bye-bye smile me and old CB

Now just look at that four wheel Fairlane just blew off my back door
Old Smokey gonna get him boy that a big 10-4
Now Hawkeye's had the hammer down since Nashville, Tennessee
He just saved some green stamps thanks to me and old CB

Hey Paul from Shaky City he's talking to a bear
He's coming on his own little quewpie doll he said
You sound like a little pretty face
I wish he would give me a breaker I tell her to go on down to 3
He might be running single like me and old CB

Windy City Charley he's down at marker 9
I just checked my 20 I ain't running far behind
Me and this eighteen-wheeler we just about home free
Made damn good time didn't pay one fine me and old CB

Aw that's a big 10-4 there old buddy yes sir got the Road Runner out there.
This is the Continental Cowboy we're gonna take her
On in there and get between them sheets and sleep,
Sleep, sleep. Keep the shiny up put the old greasy
Down see you on the flip side",Me and Ole C.B.,1978
Dave Dudley,"I was out on the leave at the time just duckin' the fog nosin' around like a hungry dog
In that crazy place called Washington DC
I saw a crowd of people on the White House lawn all carrying signes about VietNam
So I went over to see what was goin' on
It was a strange looking bunch but then I never could understand some people
Oh a fellow came to me with a list in his hand he said we're gatherin' names to send
The telegram of sympathy then he handed me a pen
I said I reckon this is goin' to kids and wives
My friends over there who're givin' their lives
He said ah ah buddy this is goin' to Ho-Chi-Min
I said Ho-Chi who he said Ho-Chi-Min people's leader North VietNam
Oh I wasn't really sure I was hearin' him right
I though I'd better move before I got in a fight
Cause my ears were hurtin' and my ball started hit my lick
Then I thought of another telegram that I've just read
Tellin' my buddy's wife that her husband was dead
It wasn't too long till I was feelin' downright sick
Another held the sign that said we won't fight
I thought to myself boy ain't that right
To leave a lot of our soldiers die instead
I said it's a shame that every man who ever died up there that far off land
Was dyin' for that you wouldn't have to wake up dead
Course he looked at me like I was kinda crazy just another warmonger
Oh I left that place and I went downtown and hit first bar that I'd found
To cool myself off and pacify my brain
You see I was on orders to VietNam little old place just north to Saigon
Had about an hour to catch myself a plane
So all I mean to say is I don't like dyin' either but man I ain't gonna crawl",Vietnam Blues,1991
Dave Dudley,"He said, ""Pardon me for bein' so bold
But you got a cigarette that's already rolled""
I gave him one, he lit it in his own good time
The smoke in that poolroom hung like a fog
When he talked it sounded like a growling dog
He said, ""Would you care for a dollar on the five or nine?""

Now this man was ugly and his eyes were mean
His clothes were dirty but his hands were clean
He held that stick like a mother holds the hand of her child
Well, I've been known to hustle a few
When the waitress said, ""Was he playing you?""
And I said, ""Yeah, bring me brandy water by""

Little Red Parker was way in the back taking quarters and handling racks
And I told him, ""Red, come up here, glue 'em up tight
That brandy had me feeling warm, I tipped that waitress
And I checked her form
And I said, ""Honey, you like a winner"", and she just smiled

I played like a man with a broken wrist, I won two and he won six
And I had him set up so I said, ""Let's play for five""
But this time the crowd had gathered round
To see this fish and just watch him drown
I told that waitress, ""More brandy water by""

Then he went out and got a custom cue
He said, ""It's no offense to you
But I don't play off the wall with nobody but friends""
He had a gold initials in a leather grip pearly and silver inlaid tip
He smiled at me and he said, ""Hell-a-way, we play for ten""

Well, I never seen a man that walk who made those balls and table talk
They're speaking English, he sure didn't need my help
He broke the ball and kept that string
For a hundred and eighty seven bucks and a ring
Till I gave up and said, ""Friend, you're gonna have to play by yourself""

Well, he racked it up and walked outside
And I strolled out just to watch him ride
And there was a blond in their caddy built like the rest of that car
The boys in the poolroom they had 'em a laugh
And I hung it up and just let it pass
And had nothin' but my elbows to put on the bar

And the waitress smiled said, ""Water by?""
I took the charity and thanked her polite
And sittin' there sippin' and suddenly I had me a thought
Unlucky gambler and lucky in love
Guess you know what I was thinking of
When I said waitress, ""Honey, what time you get off?""",The Pool Shark,1995
Dave Dudley,"When John Henry was just a little bitty boy no bigger than the palm of your hand
His mommy looked down at John Henry and say
Well Johnny you're gonna be a steal drivin' man Lord lord
Well Johnny you're gonna be a steal drivin' man
John Henry he said to his Captain he said Captain why don't you learn to swing
I'm drivin' forty-nine pounds from my hip on down
I love to hear that cold steel ring Lord Lord I love to hear that cold steel ring
[ guitar ]
John Henry had a pretty little woman and her name was Polly Ann
John Henry he took sick and he had gone to bed
Polly drove the steel like a man Lord Lord but Polly drove the steel like a man
John Henry went up on that mountain had that steam hammer by his side
Well beat that drill till the end of the line
He laid down his hammer and he cried Lord Lord he laid down his hammer and he cried
[ guitar ]
John Henry drove the steel on that mountain till that hammer caught on fire
Well the very last words I'd hear ol' John Henry say
Cool glass of water I'm gonna die Lord Lord a cool glass of water I'm gonna die
Well they bury John Henry in the graveyard they laid him six feet under the sand
Everytime a freight train go a rollin' on by
They say yonder lies a steel drivin' man Lord Lord well yonder lies a steel drivin' man




",John Henry,1996
Dave Dudley,"Doo da doo doo doo a doo da doo doo doo
Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy haulin' freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Wow what a girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her towel away
I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
A doo da doo doo doo a doo da doo doo doo

Oh I love the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I guess I'm gettin' bolder cause I'd rather kiss and hold her
Than just keep a lookin' at her everyday
At 4:45 coffee drinking eatin' time Jimmy shimmies
While I wake up the artist who painted the display
Of the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Doggone that girl wearing nothing but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed painter said the girl wasn't real better get the (kwee) on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You will find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way
Scattered by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
A doo da doo doo doo a doo da doo doo",Girl on the Billboard,1996
Dave Dudley,"I wheeled into a truck stop in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dan
I heard that old jukebox a playin'
Song about a truck drivin' man

That waitress done brought me my coffee
I thanked her and I called her back again
I said, ""You know that song, it sure did fit me
I'm just a truck drivin' man""

So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man

I climbed up aboard my old semi
Then like a flash, I was gone
Got old them big wheels a rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man

I said, pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man
Yeah, I'm just a truck drivin' man

Dave Dudley,"I got on my wheels
And I went out on the town draggin'
I hit a big oak tree
It looked like a wreck to the wagon

I got a hospital bill
And the judge waitin' for me to pay
I had a sweet little honey
Just two six packs away

I told the judge there was two trees
And I went 'tween 'em
(Two six packs away, yeah)

He said, from what I hear your condition
That's the way that you seen 'em
(Two six packs away, yeah)

He laid down a hammer
And he gave me ninety long days
I had a sweet little honey
Just two six packs away

Well, I'm workin' on a country road
But it's sunny weather
It's gonna take a while
To put my wheels back together

Now Sunday rolls around
That's my cigarette day
And my baby's still a waitin'
Just two six packs away

When I get out of this place
And don't say I never saw one
(Two six packs away, yeah)

Goin' down to Joe's
And have that big bartender draw one
(Two six packs away, yeah)

For my throat is dry
And my mouth feels like clay
And my baby is a waitin'

Dave Dudley,"I got about half high
So I spent the whole weekend out

I just picked it up and run
And I ain't been back there since

Constantly medical come right out them jars
Deserve a medal for surviving these scars

We backspace and delete a nigga
Them A list parties I never see them niggas
That weed and liquor blurry your vision
You'll never see the picture
Don't be defensive, L told me nigga just be consistent
From Little Caesar's splitting
Niggas change you see 'em different
Aim for the top though
First class plane to Morocco
The change came I ain't change
I might cop a Picasso
I'm after bags I'm eating crabs on blocks they will not go
These niggas sad and you can smell it on me I am not broke
Roll up the nitro, only copping coke when the price low
In the Maybach told the driver follow where Artie Bike go
Learn survival before you meet your idols as far as I know
This pistol my insurance ain't no need for calling Geico

Nobody knew you then you had to get booked
Shoot at the car, hit the driver

Remember sitting in the court like damn I'm back in these cuffs

Property of the ghetto
Choppers popping
I should receive a medal for surviving
If you snooze, sleep with your snub nose
I did receive a medal from Harvard and rose above those
Obstacle courses where cops and shots'll stop you 
From reaching your full potential
You dreaming, life'll pinch you
This with no sheet of paper
No pen or pencil, straight off the mental
Off the fly
Often they falsify what they been through
I'm on that old flyness
Sliding in Benzes
Minding my business
My time is expensive
My dogs locked down they surviving through pictures
We wish we could break the bars, the law's extensive
My mind gotta be twisted
You dealing with sickos, psychos
Pona, 12, Teflon vest for your chest in this hell
He wearing beads on his neck to cast away the spells
And tattoos of his loved ones that they resting well

Ten thousand cash on me daily, I must be fucking crazy
The ladies love me lately
Butter Mercedes, parquet with a touch of gravy
That's brown seats
The motto is still fuck you, just pay me
My neighbor addicted to water, he stuck in the Navy
Same block where you could lose your life
I be comfortable baby
My bitch is way badder than yours, tell me why would I stare
Never dying my hair
I wake up, get high as a Lear
You looking at me too long, niggas die for a stare
Drano said he like them Giuseppe's, I'ma buy him a pair
I'ma run my city to the point I get high with the mayor
This ain't Roc-A-Fella
But we forming a Dynasty here
Triangle, smoke choke 'em, I watch them guys strangle
Lost five of my closest
Now I know I got five angels

I could take you to kitchens where they actually cook
Nobody knew you then you had to get booked
Shoot at the car, hit the driver
Now the passenger shook
This pack just came in from Cali
I ain't passing this kush
Remember sitting in the court like damn I'm back in these cuffs
From having arguments with smokers I ain't have enough dust
Early morning fifty baggies hit the Ave in a rush
We tryna get it, might do credit
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch

Hundreds we touch, I could, I could
Hundreds we touch
I might do credit, might do credit
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch

She ain't fucking with the help but gave the boss head
And most my niggas is crip but I want the Porsche red

Jumping on the Bruckner backwoods and marijuana
Whole block sweating it's feeling just like a sauna
I can't predict the future but bet I fuck up some commas

Chinese and some Kennedy fried, that's all I digest
Can't just get it, be patient cause it's a process
These niggas don't care about living long as they die fresh

Bully told me he on tour with Trigger, shit is heavenly
I'm still in the junkie house, I promise in a month I'm out
Phone clicking all this chicken got me in your hunny mouth
Crashed up my first whip, they say I took the dummy route
My man took some pills to Virginia, he tryna run the south

Now we in the Prada Store
Couple bands on me homie
Soul probably got some more
Real niggas love me unconditional, ain't gotta talk
Even got the driver blowing sour, we ain't gotta walk
Started as a lookout, then I got my own work
Accountable as paper after school, that was my homework
Text wasn't going through, I don't think this phone work
Now I got my own shirt, I really did my own dirt
Same niggas hating, same niggas want a picture now
Freaky always on my mind, it's hard to put the liquor down
Loose spots for raw, 2Pac Shakur, I get around
Snapbacks, no more fitted now, I brought some hitters round
To silence the whispers and the side talk
Really from the streets, my first cousin is the sidewalk
I stopped hearing gossip the minute the pilots fly off
Stay in your lane, you missed your exit, you shoulda got off
I just want a Audemars, cuban and a foreign car
Say I've got them black bottles, they thinking we own the bar
I was out grindin, you was playstation, Tony Hawk
No cab fare, could only walk through this lonely dark Harlem
This for Carver, Jeff Wilson, AK's
11, 99, Johnson [?], they make cake
Blowing exotic in the tropics in a linnen shirt
Harlem till I'm in the dirt, leave these niggas feelings hurt

It's hard to leave the crib without the hammer, they'll rock ya
Got kicked out of school, he had the hammer in his locker
I'm from the streets, never won a grammy or an oscar

They say I'm cool, like a move, like a groove, like a gangster
We blow pounds my niggas hold me down like an anchor
Downtown shopping, me and gudda on some high fashion
[?] still ride past us, they swing but they not Cassius
Green we got faster the dream from not having
I see success but this VVS will stop traffic
Shaking box from palace, I just got a call from Statik
It's Lucky 7, my bitch undressed and chiroq splashing
But I'm a Henny sipper, talk fly skinny nigga
Crumb to a loaf, you can see we're stacking pennies, getcha
I seen thug on my plug, got the block bumping
We ain't got shit to talk about, unless you cop something
Collecting change like a meter
Bajan Derek Jeeter, dump the baggies food save it in the freezer
That Benz like a woman, that Mercedes I just need her
First frag and probably get a reaction from Peter

He gave me a look as if he didn't know
I had my basketball and my now and laters
Ain't get along with my neighbors, I was a rough kid
Hearing sirens through my window
Them blue and red lights kept me up at night
I couldn't get enough of life
I seen this kid get arrested in the park
He was screaming he ain't do it
They ain't even let him talk
I ain't understand I'm like 10 blowing in the wind
Tryna find a park to go play, I don't know the drama
I ask my mama what do police do?
She told me stay up out they way
Go to school and get good grades
One day I'm walking in my building and they stopped me
Told me I looked just like this kid that did a robbery
And I ain't never stole nothing in my life
Maybe candy out the store or a bag of chips

Imagine this, years go by, I got a little older
My best friends in group homes, I got a little colder
I'm tryna make the varsity team, chill with Stacy and
Shop at the mall, only Ralph Lauren they'll lace me in
I had the Moncler, remember begging moms for it
Walking home from school, I almost got robbed for it
I took off, I can't go home without my jacket on
Blue and whites harassing me but I don't know what happened to 'em
Left and right I'm seeing homies get interrogated
We ain't safe where we live, this America ain't it?
High School they teaching me this the land of the free
But everything got a price, they don't answer to me
They don't answer to us, we getting tattoos
They think we criminals cause we believe that cash rules
Attitude a little different when you from the gutter
I seen a cop talk crazy to my mother
My father familiar, he told me all about 'em
Told me never go around and avoid 'em, that's if you can
Black intelligent man they worst nightmare
They'd rather have you in prison forever, they don't fight fair
Starting to think about college, I got some scholarships
I just graduated, two cops pulled me over
Tried to show my diploma, they ain't acknowledge it
Three young black males riding in the jeep
Bout to go to college, they thinking we in the street
They hate got a little bit deeper, I'm getting frustrated

A bunch of slick comments, I'm still a nigga
Even if you got millions, they still'll get ya
I played ball, I was the man on campus
Little weed up in my dorm, I got ran off campus
Then I got locked up, minor bid, it was short
Staring at my mother crying up in court
Came home, I started rapping, had to trap first
Phone ringing all night, was tryna take a nap first
Gang squad hopping out, narcotics watching
We had the weed and the pills then we got it rocking
Cameras in the projects helped us move smarter
Niggas turned butch building into the new carter
Pooch did a bid and came home the same nigga
Bully did a bid and came home the same nigga
My moms working all night, I had late dinners
Went broke tryna cope a coat, that made me hate winter
Focused up, got a deal, now this shit is real
Every time I leave the club, they hope I got the steel
We just got some weed, we just tryna chill
We just tryna eat, we just tryna build
They follow every car I try to ride in
I'm just praying this ain't the car that I die in
I guess with this hoodie on I'm a murderer
I'm just tryna buy my mother some new furniture
This attitude is programmed
Imagine getting harassed for you whole life
All day and the whole night
They say prison is the new slave ship
They don't understand we hustling so we can pay rent
Soon as they come around it feel like your luck gone
They gotta show you they power, that's why they put the cuffs on
Ain't no more weed in the car sir, the blunt gone
I got my hands ups, officer what's the problem?
Please don't shoot me sir, I just had a daughter
Look here go a",Don't Shoot,2016

Coulda flexed when I saw you, I ain't even stunt
Pull up on 'em in the back I ain't even front
Eating off of a day party, I ain't even lunch
But sometimes you gotta miss a meal to make a mil
Just because you making money that don't make you real
Put her hands in my pants, had to make her feel
Playing with that black mamba, how that Laker feel
I might go Kobe in that thing
Might go Kobe with the rings
Slide up in it five times
Pop them bottles five times
I hit 50 on 'em niggas, came through with 5 dimes
5 shots, five lines
Soo-wu, five slimes

I got misses in different cities, they ain't never meeting

I told her I don't do no drugs, I just be heavy weeded
She know I really was outside, I been in every precinct
She bend itover, I get closer, lotta heavy breathing
She told me I was in her stomach, I get very deep in
That ass for me, she splashed the cheeks until that bed is leaking
My iPhone keep me in drama, I wish I had a beeper
The loudest reefer, cold champagne, I'm in Italian sneakers
She never speak on how we creeping guess that's now our secret
Monday to Thursday I'm grinding so we get wild as Weeknd
Smell like she fresh out the shower, no doubt I'm down to eat it
We in Christians his and her
Daily switching different purse
I do Henny, she do vodka, hit it before she go to work
Out in pubic we be touching, people talking like yo y'all bugging
Me and her be taking flights, we got matching Goyard luggage, uh

Dave East,"Six million ways to die
(Took a lot to get this Rollie nigga)
Six million ways to get rich
(Huh, hah)

Everybody keep telling me ""make a club record""
You ain't trapping no more, stop making drug records
You got a daughter 'bout to come, stop making thug records
I brought that money back fast, I had the plug flexing
Welcome to Harlem, el Barrio, that's the drug section
Hit your bitch with my jeans on, ain't making love naked
I got love for my loco but I know 'cuz reckless
I ain't gotta sleep in the projects, I did enough stressing
My father was a rolling stone but taught me one lesson
Do your dirt by yourself, your friends be the ones telling
I knew it broke my mother's heart to know her son selling
I had coke in my dresser, trifling as ever
I had a dream Biggie featured me on Life After
I be with my same niggas, I don't really like rappers
Niggas can't make a song for nothing but they nice actors
Go and get a movie role, low bagging up tuna rolls, raw shit
I come from a block where you seen it but never saw shit
I be at the juice bar, my wheat grass and bark shit
My younging just came from up north, he want to park shit
Tryna teach him something bout life and how we started
Lower class poverty, homies from jail calling me
Playing the number everyday but never hit the lottery
Liquor store on every corner, might as well get drunk
I remember that free lunch wasn't shooting, we would jump stones
Niggas like the end of the blunt, traps load up
I told papi I got him by the end of the month
I was thinking bout 550's with the cinnamon guts
These shots'll blow your mind away, now your memory dust
And memory of, I got a JF Kennedy buzz
Presidential called enterprise, I need another rental
Tryna take a package down to North Carolina
Maybe buy some Ferragamo, I'm so focused on the commas

If you never been broke it's gon' be hard to feel me
Only Allah get my flow, it's gon' be hard to kill me
They say practice make perfect, we at it every day
Thinking about that consignment, sometimes I never paid
It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something
Conversations 'bout paper homie, let's burn something
It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something
Conversations bout 'paper homie, let's burn something

It's hard to stop what's already in motion
I ain't gotta hit your blunt, I've already been smoking
G Star denims on my Shmurda shit
In '08 my mental was really on some murder shit
'Cause nothing was working out
Just to pass the time started working out
Me and my nigga Jay Black from way back
He a Bronx nigga, met him in Queens
Butch crib, met up with fiends
Imagine Nas signed you, hell of a dream
Somebody pinch me
Promise nothing they say ever getting to me
Used to watch House Party, not kidding play listen to me
This that talk that make the hustlers want to open shop
This that stash house talk, don't let 'em know the spot
This that talk that got my city wanting to rap again
This that all black everything like an African
This that middle of the summer in a trench coat
Glock 19 reminding them of how you been broke

If you never been broke it's gon' be hard to feel me
Only Allah get my flow, it's gon' be hard to kill me

Dave East,"I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
(Real life though) I cannot
I cannot believe it
Eyes open

She from Jamaica, Queens, only came to Harlem to shop
Her mother just got a divorce and her father a cop
I learned this about 10 minutes in the conversation
I'm thinking I don't even know you, why that information?
My head was racin', I'm pacin' back and forth
Asked her for her number, her name Keisha, nice to meet ya
She said she never fucked with nobody from Harlem
I've got homies from south side, I figured I would call them
I found out exact locations and where she grew up
Her mom's new boyfriend got some coke, then he blew up
She used to play with credit cards and line niggas at night clubs
Fucked a couple niggas but left 'em cause she ain't like love
I was down in Flight Club, Keisha text me like ""What you doing?""
""I scuffed up my retro's, I'm bout to cop some new ones""
She said she at the Mandarin Oriental in Columbus Circle
She got some sour but she wanted purple
I told her later we can link up
I called my youngin Conner bring an eighth to her
He plotting on taking her
Funny lil' nigga, but fuck it, that's how we raised
If it ain't wifey than all the homies can play
Back to Keisha, she black but had them Spanish features
Five seven, most these niggas would plan to keep her
I got that drop from my homie that knew her, he went to school with her
Said he used to be cool with her, but he ain't fuck her though
Con' callin' me, I forgot to text him the address
I'm going through some other shit, honestly got me mad stressed
If Con' delivered that, we 'bout to meet
I gotta a club tonight, told Keisha if she up I hit her when it's over
Now it's Rosé, Henny, Rosé, Henny
Strippers all over me, I ain't throwing a penny
Got a text from Keisha, ""I'm in room 17C
I know your with your homies now but later come and see me""
I'm Rollied out, sky dweller, the light hittin' it right
I'm hearing niggas talking like, ""That's Dave East, that nigga nice""
Wayno told me 30 minutes, flat line, backwoods I pack mine
Unless I want 'em harsher, please don't no one bother
I called my driver and told him take me to midtown
Had to stop for condoms 'cause raw ain't the way I get down
He dropped me off, I told him ""Park it and don't leave yet
Let me see what this bitch about, something I gotta figure out""
I'm in the 'tele, I hit the elevator blunted
Stumbling, just Hennessey and Rosé up in my stomach
Figure we fuck and then order some room service
I knocked twice, she opened the door but so nervous
Maybe I was buggin, I was drunk, she was ready though
Came up out of everything, R. Kelly on the radio
Slim waist, Hershey chocolate skin, ass heavy though
On everything, I fucked this bitch delirious, shit Eddie know
Henny taking over, we passed out, at least I did
15,000 in my Balmain's, I'm lackin'
I put my Rollie in the dresser with like four chains
My ID and my bank cards, iPhone 6 to make calls
Condom box of 3-pack, I used two of them
Brand new Fendi sneakers, the club just ruined 'em
Something told me wake up, I checked the bed
Nothin' but pillows and cover, I had to shake my head
I checked me jeans, every dollar gone, that's 15k
All my chains and my Rollie missing
I put my shit on, looking for my phone, that shit was gone too
I'm ready to kill Keisha, what the fuck I'm gon' do?
I told myself I wasn't drinking, why the fuck I get bent?
And how the fuck I get robbed?
I ran out, my driver sleep, I woke him up like ""You ain't see that bitch
Brown skin, thick, probably moving on some schemin' shit?""
He telling me that he was sleeping, waiting on my phone call
I cannot believe this shit, can't wait until I see this bitch
This for every nigga that be slippin' 'cause he think he rich
Keisha you a sneaky bitch, called shooter I'ma need the grip
Fuck

I cannot believe this bitch robbed me
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe this bitch robbed me
If I catch her I ain't tryna hear I'm sorry
I cannot believe this bitch robbed me
I cannot believe it

Dave East,"Uh, I fell in love with you early, it's dark and hell is hot
Around '97 fiends selling soap and selling socks
The only thing that kept me cool in this cold world
The streets got me under influence, I've been ruined

I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Like
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Like
Is that what you need love for?
What do you need?

Keep me on my toes, I want you baby
Love I had the right to baby
Love you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you
I want you

The culture what I care about
The cyphers on the stair cases
Me and my man got knocked, we had to share cases
I do it for the love, the hate keep the balance right
Red wine dining, it feel like a steak and salad night, uhm
Nothing in this world can compare to the music
Imagine changing your life after you said you'd do it
More respect than love so I ain't complaining
I'm vacation planting 'toes out in the Caymans
Thousands Islands, been violent long as I can remember
When your head not working that's a different December
I got love for the game, I keep my mind humble
Realizing I'm surviving in a wild jungle
No stressing, learn lessons on how to save it
Now I got your favorite models naked
Survival is amazing
This Rollie like the ring of a champion
I used to tuck all of my work up under the Champion
Dumb wild nigga

All I want is you baby
You're the one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you baby
Love I had the right to baby
Love you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you
I want you

We just need enough for us to break down
Shake the town, even them other niggas relate now
Hate the small talk before they ask for something
Don't ask me nothing
Came up off a couple grams, I'm used to not having nothing
My moms and pops tried they best but I wanted more
Niggas rather go shopping, I'm tryna own the store
I'm tryna own some more, equity, real estate I'm investing in
I go to work like I'm Mexican
Always get amnesia when they come in for questioning
Looking for medicine
Only rookie getting respect from the veterans
We was raw measuring, the scale broke, eyeball it
You afraid of contact, nobody fouled you so why call it?
Money flowing, I was staring at that white Taurus
Fiji bottles, I'm bougie, please get the white water
Went from a dime to a five after the lights caught her
Miami, we made a movie, I think I like Florida

I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Why?
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions

Is that what you need love for?
What do you need?",The Only Thing,2016
Dave East,"Nah, no I'm not
Nah, nobody on this
You know how that go

Now I'm living with a purpose, I ain't perfect
Allah got me, ain't spend too much time in churches
This from the heart, I ain't spend too much time rehearsing
I was really thinking rob before I purchased
I was really thinking God these niggas thirsty
Paranoid around soft niggas, they make me nervous
Clutching a pistol around these clowns that shit'll surface
If you knew my life you would understand I deserve it
Nobody gave me shit, told me I was worthless
Felt like I was cursed until the day that paper surfaced
It's a reason why me and Beans can relate in person
I'm cut from that cloth, all that talking'll get you murdered
I relaxed on that juice, them percocets be testing me
Plus your bitch keep texting me, I ain't attracted sexually
These niggas selling blow up, got the fiends frustrated
Tryna get this dough up, package on me, ratchet on me
Tell me what your life like cause mines is real
Every thing signed and sealed, my mind on pills
Niggas'll rat on they own mother, they see that time get real
Teddy bears and candle lightings give your moms the chills

As far as I can remember I've been a real one
They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come

Pressure's on once again but I embrace it
I weathered through the storm before, I'm never breaking
I do this for the youth in the Matrix who won't make it
I tell 'em every knock is a boost, remain patient
But every move he make is calculated through his hunger
It's sad to say shorty might not make it through the summer
His mom turned tricks for a fix, pills strung her
He only met his pop for flicks and a jail jumper
His stomach empty but his clip full
He pop xannies by the fist full
Drink syrup, skip school
Pants hanging off his ass, ain't been in the bath
I try to steer 'em right cause I hate to see him crash
Tell him just stay in his lane and remain humble
You bound to get hit in the game just don't fumble
I seen G's drop the ball and straight crumble
Just know if your aunt had a dick she'd be your uncle
What your life like nigga mines is real
No if, mights, maybes, probably, wills
I blow your fucking head off with that revolver steel
I shot a nigga on tour, got that revolver still
Know when you fucking with the Bully you involved with real
I put your body somewhere, they won't solve your kill nigga
You need to stop if you think Mac won't pop it
And your mom in all black out casket shopping
It's the Broadstreet Bully and Dave East, yeah we playing for keeps
These niggas dressing like freaks and they calling it fleek
These niggas be signing sheets plus they calling police
Know every nigga in the ghetto ain't involved in the streets
We ain't really into the games we gon' rest you to peace
Pull something big out, give you a long kiss on the cheek
Who ready to die? Sky's the limit who want beef?
I was a bad boy before I repped the ROC
This ain't nothing new shit this just what the fuck we do
We like no limit soldiers and nigga I'm that true
The reason, the solution nigga I'm that too
Whoever stuck to the realness, then I'm that glue
It's a war going on outside you ain't safe from
You can play Super man, you get your cape hung
We don't start no shit and we don't take none
We just 100% until our day come

They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come

Dave East,"I wrote my way out
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Running on empty, with nothing left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen
And wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power, just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was I sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin'
""Oh, you think you smart? Blah! Start bleedin'""
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, pssh, you'll get 'em right back
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
Damn, you got no chill, fuckin' right I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery

And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out

No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)

If you a plate, I could taste the money
Never get out of my zone
I come around she get out of them clothes

She found out she pregnant with twins, ain't that crazy?

No right or wrong way for dealing with this
Everyone's still just adjusting, I guess

And look how they robbed me, I hate how they robbed me
See Jake started speakin', his first word was, ""truck""

Options got a limit to 'em
Shiesty from where the children ruined

Dave East,"We gotta get it
They hated Esco
They hated Escobar
I'm still here
Dave East talk that talk
Streets need that
NYC, L.A., Chicago, Detroit, the whole world
Lets get it

I had a basic plan, get out the projects and never look back
Could still smell the aroma from when my uncle would cook crack
One conversation between homies, better yet brothers
That used to spend the night with each other
They moms was best friends
One name was Anthony, the hood called 'em Ant Live
Kept his pistol on 'em, so he bought a bigger pant size
He got a little colder the moment he watched his man die
That was ten years ago
Baby-face, wishing that his beard would grow
Now he throw a set up anywhere he go
He just a product of his environment
Told me he'd rather die than ever go to Rikers again
Did a bid, his celly was blood, he studied five percent
Came home, like let niggas see me, I'll never ride with tint
Cory was his right-hand man, his mother up North
She was busting checks with the wrong nigga
He popped Xannys and he just want him some strong liquor
Lose the attitude, he miserable
For years he tried to get a lick or two
Moms begging he finish school, but non-sense he get into
Ant' met Cory when they was kids with innocence
Ant' hated his dad around 'cause that nigga was militant
Cory found a hoe to pass, some cash, they could triple it
Double it, stack it up, Cory ain't never want to spend
Ant' was blowing money fast, big Meeching when he shopped
Flashy nigga, body wrapped in diamonds, necklace, and the watch

They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it
They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it

Ant' and Cory set up a trap, fiends in and out of that
No mask, stocking cap, they robbed him, but he got it back
Six in the morning with baggies on him was a way of life
Streets will teach you quick, ain't nothing free, pay the price
Eviction notice in the kitchen, your bitch will stay the night
Cory had the sour with him, Ant' fuck with 'yola
Got kicked out his moms crib, she found a couple boulders
Locked up with killers up North, he rubbed a couple shoulders
Cory told Ant' on the V I the block was changing
Ant' told Cory be grateful, freedoms' amazing
Three and half light bid, Ant' stayed in drama
He was light skinned, outside before you niggas was typing
No MySpace
Cory and Ant' had butter rockin'
The other younger niggas from the block, just loved to watch him
Couple haters, but nothing major, they knew the streets
Niggas caught Cory, made him take off that new Philippe
Cory took it on the chin, he wasn't new to beef
Killers kill you for talking, all you gotta do is speak
Thats a man down, Ant' told Cory have the fam 'round
And keep on shitting on niggas until your pants brown
They hustle low, so much evidence that can't found
Cory got nervous whenever they spun that Van 'round
They snatched him and he talked about the way he got it
Broke the code, that was snitchin', it ain't no way around it

Can't describe the pain I felt when people told me you should ball
On the hood just want a week without an interview
Want my brother to know if he feeling pain, I feel it too
I used to want Angelettie to do an interlude
Now it's so many mad rappers, shit if he did it? Cool

It's Dark Force Vader work
Choke a nigga way across the room, that's the way to work
Starin' at the picture, seen the picture move
Jumped in the picture, can you picture how I get to you?
Told East, we could touch the book, make the scripture move
Told East, we could touch a killer, make a pistol move
Ghost is still provin' shit, I ain't got shit to prove
I could see the money play, send my shit in large bills
Know it as the Devil's game, understand it's God's field

I ain't goin' back to being broke
I had roaches in my crib, sticks and c's all in my smoke
I had niggas jealous of me 'fore I ever had to gloat
Eviction notice on the door, my bed was on the floor
Oh lord, I ain't going back to being broke
Wake up, going trap was all we know
Make a couple racks, go get some more
Break it down and vacuum seal the smoke

Woke up, snatched my pistol out the couch
Niggas just robbed the connect
Get your shit, we gotta bounce
We was almost grabbing P's
We was gettin' it by the ounce
So, I took a trip down south
We put up enough to get a house
Shit got hot and we got out
Back up top, I need a block
Pooch could cook, just need a pot
You say you got work, I don't need it now
I'm in a drop and I'm speedin' (skrt)
Talking police, I don't see them now
I got the Glock for no reason (no reason)
It's hard to tell who be scheming now
I ain't going back to selling smoke
Going back to selling pills
Loaded weapon in my coat
Now I'm somewhere in the Hills
Private jet, Givenchy clothes
Need some Fronto, I could roll
Shit, I'm counting, got me cold (ice cold)

Wake up, going trap was all we know
Make a couple racks, (Holiday Season) go get some more
Break it down and vacuum seal the smoke

Ayy, I bought them in the back, and posted slums is where I come from
Rats and roaches, Henny toasting ease the pain to keep calm
I picked up the pistol before I ever seen a pack
Turned up by the streets then I went turned out the snakes
How deep is that, I'ma tell ya
Pop was always in and out, same way as my trap, yeah
Doors swinging, niggas banging, that .40 still on my lap, don't need your hoe
Put family first and be about your paper
Never thought you'd see my Bloods united, thuggin' with all these neighbors
We're talking Crips, real drip
Whenever you see Scoob, I'm talking never
Will I ever go back back, what I'm used to, I was so broke
Roam at home, I had shit by my lonely on it
If I was born in slave days, they had to store me, I'm so rebellious
Fuck niggas jealous, they always have been, I'ma tell you
My nigga, I'm telling you
I don't fuck with has-beens, I save ya
Young nigga save ya
Anything we have been, when beef, I bring all the flame
I guess I'm trapping no failure
I will not save ya, you can ask my past friend, I'm ridin'
On buns off bih, John Gotti henchmen
I was slipping, I was falling but a nigga got the fuck up

We got a problem here?
Holiday season

I got the drop uptown, they said they robbing niggas (uptown)
You want your block, you can't hustle until you find them niggas (find them niggas)
Ignorant adolescence lackin' a father figure
Life been kind of rough, couldn't find him smiling in all his pictures (at all)
I can teach you how to drive, sit and park it with ya (c'mere)
We fought before we was hitting, shit, really off the liquor (bah, bah)
Let me tell you about my man, he made his maths double (double)
Like Biggie song, they shot his daughter in the calf muscle
A hundred percent, wasn't the type to half-hustle
Might die for free, it's guaranteed if a bag touch you (bag)
He was connected in Milwaukee, came back to Harlem
Five fifty, the same colour, his coffin (brown)
Packages was duct-taped, the whip had new car scent (new)
Paranoid he circled the block before he parked it (paranoid)
He usually would stop at the bodega 'fore he talked shit
A fiend peeped us early and told us, she saw a brick (word?)
Comfortable, we slid through in a grey Lacoste fit
Glock .40 on him, he been hearing niggas talk shit
Funny stares and whispers like every time he walk in
It's hard to see if sharks in the water, don't see no shark fin
Niggas sit crowded at the lobby, he played the park bench
Seen a nigga ratted, 10 years ago, they ain't talk since (not a word)
Homie tried to speak and he ignored him
They really don't be beefing, niggas be dying over boredom
He recognised another kid that usually shop on Fordham (BX)
Somethin' with this son, if he was dolo, he'd have called him
Shawty really come from nothing, survival's exhausting
Two options, go to court or get low in a coffin (get low)
Body language different, he feeling like niggas talking
Keep praying to Jesus, he feeling like niggas crossed him
Hard to find his homies, he feeling like niggas lost him
Connect said he would front him a brick, but it would cost him
His connections from the mid-west just had him flossing (shine)
Flexed on the plug, said he'd had enough, he could toss town
Spanish nigga with him helped understand when they talking
Connect kept telling jokes, he said he was Kevin Hart's friend
Homie ain't come here for no comedy show
Catch a homie, get low, not even you mommy could now
No business, this shit was personal
He in the trap with a brick, thinking 'bout if he spit, what would he get for a verse or two
He'd invite some close friends, ride by in a hearse or two
His life a movie, death just fucked it up like commercials do
He told his stupid nigga, I could work with you
Kill a n nigga that you got love for, that shit hurt to do (it hurt)
Fuck the emotions, we got work to move
Still got his gun and his mans, he in a certain mood
When he was starving, you get murked for food
Niggas caught him picking up his daughter, putting work at school
They was aiming at his head and hit her in the leg
Wasn't no money, it was just over some shit he said (watch your mouth)
The last time we spoke he said he'd try and get some bread
I got off of tour, came home, found out my nigga dead

The shit we go through, you know
Can't make this shit up
Put the gun away, nigga
Can we have one night with no fighting and nobody get shot?

I talk to God, the devil on the other line stressin'
Keep a weapon there, 'cause slippin' ain't how I'm gon' learn no lesson
Ain't no actors here, I told Bully, ""I wish that Stack was here""
Mugga too, my hoody blue, so much ice, they gon' have to stare
Used to hate my building smell, half for the homies still in jail
Harlem different, either kill a cell or pray to lift your bail
White rice and tuna fish, way before Ruth Chris
We was broke, I ain't care who was rich, stick up kids do exist
Hard news, just listen, the dog food was clickin'
They moved bitch, long before I heard of Ludacris
I watched it with my own eyes, dirty kitchen for home fries
Hajjis if ain't nothin' open, just make sure they toast mine
I'm thankful for them steak and cheese, I love the hood, I'd hate to leave
How the fuck was we trappin' outside when it was eight degrees?
I still have a hard time tryna understand why Ma$e would leave
Gave niggas the reason, plus the truth, I could relate to Beans
Free Meek, I'm just tryna chase a dream
They'd rather us upstate and grainy, you never had to chase a fiend
Passed them off the 'Gram, and then they ran before they paid you

I'm just grateful for them whuppings my pops used to give us to keep us out the street
In the projects, the water cold at least three days out the week
This real talk, I done seen some shit wake you out your sleep
Lit the crib up with candles, felt like the lights was out for weeks

Thank you Lord, I'm grateful Lord, if I got it, I blame you Lord
My life, it been dangerous Lord, my faith in you could change it Lord
Wasn't tryna scare niggas, foreheads was what we was aimin' for

Spend some money, make some more, never thought I'd make it poor
Imagine we was takin' score, militant, I relate to war

Sellin' out these shows that make my homies smile
Wake up in Miami to hear the ocean sound
Grateful I seen eighteen, grateful I seen twenty-one
Grateful that my pops ain't throw me out, he found my nigga gun
Of course I said it wasn't mine
Runnin' to the park told my father, let's talk another time

Me and Loc use to stand by the store
Hope the cameras was off, I did my own dirt, puttin' all of my own work
How much I could make off of these grams? That was my homework
You can't understand the highway 'till you hit the road first
Thinking I was a draft pick the minute I had that growth spurt
Same nigga played the corner, bodega with no shirt
Sunflower seeds and Sour Patches, I was askin'
For extensions on the rent, now it's designer fabric (designer)
Couldn't sit on auntie furniture, if not the plastic (we couldn't)

Had no TV, now I pay multiple cable bills
I remember Malil tellin' me ""take the wheel""
Back when Freekey told me rap they probably gonna make a deal
Deafen up my body, I hate the way it make me feel
If my niggas slidin', I'm slidin', I really played the field
We got felonies but jealously can never break us
Talked to Drizzy up in Toronto, I'm missin' hella paper
Most of my niggas do biz chasin' money, go up north and get big
Might not come home to no crib
We got parole on us, walk with the heat, we keep the stove on us
NYPD just pray that I get pulled with old warrants

Can't be indecisive, these streets will help you to learn your choice

I chill with women, they chill with niggas, they different niggas

I benefitted from plenty hitters, they still my niggas

Headshots, used to be a scope, I put a laser there
Put newspaper on the carpet, air who walking
I don't trust these voices talking or the walls in my apartment
It's getting darker, pistol under the parka
Imagine, pouring Fruity Pebbles and roaches fall out
Make you wanna go to court, shoot the judge before you walk out
Make you wanna eat a nigga food, just pull a fork out
I be doing push ups in my cell before I talk 'bout
Anything we involved in, criminal code
Ex-bitches ready for war, they some militant hoes
Coke in the flesh, this that shit you feel in your nose
You college niggas come see how it feel to chill with a pro
Could never compare, you don't know how it feel to be broke
Just tryna get high, niggas you feed and stealing your smoke
Can never punch her but when I fuck her she still can get choked

I had that butter shit, I called it margarine
Now I make more than my teachers
I bet I black out on all of my features
Broke, I call my cousin for sneakers
Smoke, they don't want none of that neither
Velour sweats like it's '89
Me and Tory on some shit again
She talk about me like a cornball
Knowin' she gon' let me hit again
Militant, from the trenches, I can count up a million
Tryna wake up on an island like Gilligan

Dave Edmunds,"I feel tears wellin' up going deep inside
Like my heart's gonna get broke
And the stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you broke me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide my sorrow
When i may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be
Now I live in fear of waking up each morning
Finding that she's gone from me
There's aching pain in my heart
For the name of the one
That I had to replace
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all",The Race Is On,1981

Without you, you got me singin' the blues

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone, I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you

Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay

Dave Edmunds,"Well, the bride looked a picture in the gown that her mama wore
When she was married herself nearly twenty-seven years before
She had to change the style a little but it looked just fine
They stayed up all night, but they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy, she's a-walkin' down the aisle
And she catches my eye and she gives me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old-fashioned, but we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today, she never could have then.

Well I can see her now in the tight blue jeans
Pumpin' all the money in the record machine
Spinnin' like a top, you shoulda seen her go
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll [Repeat: x4]

Now her proud daddy only wanna give his little girl the best
And so he put down a grand on a cozy little lover's nest
You could've called the reception an unqualified success
At a flash hotel for a hundred and fifty guests

Take a look at the bridegroom smilin' pleased as pie
Shakin' hands all around with a glassy look in his eye
He got a real good job and his shirt and tie is nice
But I remember a time when she would never even look him twice

But I can see her now drinkin' with the boys
Breakin' their hearts like they were toys
She used to do the pony, she used to do the stroll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll [Repeat: x4]

Well I can see her now with her headphones on
Jumpin' up and down to her favorite song
I still remember when she used to wanna make a lot of noise
Hoppin' and boppin' with the street corner boys

On across Caroline.

We stopped at Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, 
We never was a minute late.
And we was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, 
Rollin' outa Georgia state.

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, 
Half way 'cross Alabam, 
When that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham.

So right away I bought me a through train ticket, 
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer outa Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans.

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town.
Well there are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Put luggage in my hands, 
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes

I'd be cured

Always static
On that line
Tear the phone out
From the wall

Get that call

She don't wanna talk to me
She just wanna look
She just wanna look through me

Who's that beast

Will I confess

You'll never know that I still love you

I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his old guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray

I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin' up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be the good Lord likes a little picking too

In the small town missionary hall
Back seat teaser never takes any money
But her friends make it nailed to the wall

Riding in a big flash car
Sets his eyes on the good time seeker
She jumps inside but they go too far

Kinda' sorry for the things that they did
Lookin' back they could have both been something

I spoke to god
But he wasn't there

Break down
Got to break down
Break down

The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

We'll send someone right out, now this won't hurt a bit
He's in a meeting now, the coat's a perfect fit
It's strictly fresh today, service with a smile
I'll love you, darling, 'til I die, we'll keep your name on file

							Words and Music by Dave Frishberg



It's a one horse town
It's a one horse way of life that I've been leading
It's a one horse town
No one in this town can give me what I'm needing

One one-chair barber shop
One local train that doesn't stop
One two-lane road, one motorcycle cop

This one horse town
Really brings me down
Still I hang around and chew the fat
With Ralph and Nat
The same old group
Those two-bit grinds
With their one-track minds
They'll wake up one day and find
I fin'lly flew the coop
I can't settle down
In this crummy one horse town


There's a roadside stand
You can go in back and feed the one-arm bandit
There's a one-man band
He can play your fav'rite song if you can stand it

Just give me one good year
I guarantee I'll disappear
I'll make my way to anywhere but here

With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

Dave Frishberg,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2001

Smilin' by now

Dave Fromer,"Oh once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,

Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather

And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail

She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.

But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros, over in Rio Dijanery
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin' in women wit' they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums
It's all about the Benjamins, what?
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what (I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga)

Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'
To my bizzalls, player, you mad false
Actin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's

Wanna be ballers, shot-callers (it's all about the Benjamins, baby)
Brawlers, who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers (it's all about the Benjamins, baby)
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus (uh, uh, what the blood clot?)

Wanna bumble with the Bee, huh?
Bzzz, throw a hex on the whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singin', ""this is for my homie""
And you know me from makin' niggas so sick
Floss in my Six, with the 'Lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines
Get your own shit, why you ridin' mine?
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380's in Mercedes, Puffy, hold me down, baby!
Only female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do
Pull the trigger too, fuck you (uh, uh, uh)

I been had skills, Cristal spill
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole, undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)
My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that for life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
Player haters, get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benjis, what

Standing tall
By the gate

Everything is new
Stare in-to
What is not
Yet

As your bones grow
And you feel the pain
In exchange

Experiences hang
Run round your mind
And collide

Hang your toes
Over the edge
Cause you can

You can switch your place
Hide in-side
If you try

You'll open up your eyes
And realize
How you fit
In the wild

A lion is a lion
No apologies
And a leash
Is a leech

In a corral
You're safe and warm
Pass it on to
A roo she/ every sheet

Time and time again
You stick your self
To accept
Someone else

Give up the wish
Let go of the dream
Barricade
Fantasy

Burn the dogma
Let the fire
Overtake
The desire
To define

I will find a way
To keep this moment
For myself I will find a way

Like a storm

Dave Grusin,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

My father was a Spanish Grandee 
But I won my wife in a card game 
To hell with those lords o'er the sea 

Well the South Coast is a wild coast and lonely 
You might win in a game at Jolon 
But a lion still rules the Barranca 
And a man there is always alone 

I played in a card game at Jolon 
I played with an outlaw named Juan 
And after I'd taken his money 
I staked all against his daughter Dawn 

I picked up the ace ... I had won her 
My heart it was down at my feet 
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry 
Like a young summer's day she was sweet. 

He opened the door to the kitchen 
And he called the girl out with a curse 
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her 
She's yours now for better or worse"" 

Her arms had to tighten around me 
As we rode down the hills to the south 
Not a word did I hear from her that day 
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth 

But that was a gay happy winter 
We carved on a cradle of pine 
By the fire in that neat little cabin 
And I sang with that gay wife of mine. 

That night I got hurt in a landslide 
Crushed hip and twice broken bone 
She saddled her pony like lightning 
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon 

The lion screamed in the Barranca 
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side 
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight 
My heart died that night with my bride

Dave Hahn,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even Spring?

Yo real
Let's make it happen
I hear voices saying that's Erick Sermon

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm in the 500, sitting on twenties
Pumping Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. getting money
I'm Hollywood swinging
It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singing
No Diggity, if it ain't def it ain't shit
I'm like kerosene I keep the place lit
Yo will fix the beat up
No beef read put the heat up
Yo Dave you the man now speak up

[Verse 2: Dave Hollister]
Friday, 5 o'clock time to close shop
Bounce through the hood, she was moving on the block
Cause my peeps already blowing up the box
With the 411 on the party hot spot
Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress
Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed
Gonna be a whole lot of woo-haa!
Know how we do on and on
Till the early morn
Always want to kick it not now I got move on
Beats pumping gotta get my groove on
Everybody's on the floor getting down
Players on the wild trying to spread the mack around
Red alert cause the bar's on fire
Serving drinks faster than you can blink an eye
Ain't gotta worry bout working next day
The weekend's here and it's time to play

This is how we roll on the weekend
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, this is how we roll
This is how we roll on the weekend [Repeat: x2]

Verse 3: Dave Hollister]
Saturday, bounce back upon the set
Shorties rolling deep looking right
Reminding me of the f I just swung her last night
Oh my god shining, talking on the phone
Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone
Gotta put my thing down
Lock down the next round knock down for the next round
There's a run for the full-court press
Up and down bringing on the opposition stress
But it's all love this is how we do
Til the next Saturday keep it all true
Next stop speed down to the mall
Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball
Same time different place
Parlay on Sunday for the weekend

I drop it right here

[Verse 4: Redman]
My persona strictly don't be caring like I'm Donna
the Jerse bomber, go 10 rounds with anaconda
I blow the 9 x to order me some pussy
The Bernie Mack'll get the party bumping like burdussy
Yo, yo I'm fucking your audio
Hardcore reservoir material video
And when you arguing me and my Dave Hollister and E walking
While the valet parking shit

We went out to dine
We strolled the beach, holding hands sharing quality time
What happened between then and now
The love we shared was lost somehow
(my friends tried to tell me)
That we're moving too fast
But how could I know the feelings would pass
It wouldn't last
I know I should've left a long time ago
But I stayed to see
Still hoping and praying you still love me

I took you in treated your children as mine
Then we laid and made love
And you had my son what a precious time
I did all that I could to get through to you
To let you know girl it's you I was living for
(but you let your mind play games on you)
Then when I'm not around

Let me call this nigga
Come on man; pick up the damn phone

[Brother]
Hello

[Sticky]
I got your pictures, damn we look just alike
A younger version of me, half my age same height
I played ""beat you up"", made you tough, thought you to fight
Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite
Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did
That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid
Caged like an animal ain't no way to live
Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid
Where you going now I can clearly see
You either going in an bag or in jail with me
Remember when we was younger and you promised me
You be the first in our fam with al college degree
I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels
And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school
I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna
Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner
You're my baby brother

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
You are my baby brother 
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

[Brother]
I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me
I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D
When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee
Yeah you right I want jewels and push a luxury V
But what's wrong with that, I want to love comfortably
Just like the next man driving round the hood in my Lex Land
I ain't got nobody taking care of me 
And as far as a school, well it just ain't for me 

[Sticky & Brother]
So what you want to do huh
What you gone sell drugs all your life
(I might)
See you ain't even right
Maybe when you sober up to see the light
(Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like)
Yo look I'm just trying to help
You know all you want to do is get blunted
(I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach)
If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind
And your child getting a father that was just like mine
You're my baby brother

[Chorus]

[Sticky & Brother]
So is you like that. I mean what's the deal?
Don't you too worry about trying to keep it real?
(Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel)
Yo what's this I hear, you had a gun concealed
(Yeah, I keep my nine (See this what I?.)
(Hold up, let me speak my mind
Look at you, you can't even talk you doing mad time)
Yeah look at me, this is how you want to be
Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee
(I got to go man)
Ooh you don't even want to hear me out?
(Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about)
All I saying is that you got to be more responsible
(Aight man, whatever I'm a talk to you)

I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth witholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

It's just way of letting me know that the time is right

How you trimble at the slightest little touch of my hand 

You know when I want it,you put nothing extra on it 
It's just the simple things that you 
You know how I like it and I ain't afraid to try it

Get up with this honey
I just met on Monday
'Cause I knew she was down

We went and had a drink or two
But all I did was think of you
And how I really love you
In spite of all our troubles
And so I stop myself

This is straight from the horse's mouth
I almost kissed her, and almost did her
And almost went there with her
And I thought about you wouldn't bounce

I know it's not that easy girl
But you gotta believe me girl
'Cause baby I ain't lyin'
I'm just sick of fightin'
And arguin' with you

Baby, why can't we be?

Were once before
And you weren't getting on mine
And I wasn't getting on your last nerve

Should've never left you feeling that way
I apologize for makin' you cry
Baby please forgive me

Just a young whippersnapper playin' ball
Tryin' to hang out with the homies after dark
We use to slap box until the street lights come on
And I can hear my mama yelling that it was time to come home
But being young you know how hard it be was
I can clearly remember all the other kids laughing at me
Because I use to wear those hand me downs
But if only they can see me now
And every now and then I reminisce about it
Well baby that's life as well you know
When you come straight from the ghetto

Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
Lookin' back as a kid again, hangin' in the hood again
Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
'Cause these are our sweet ghetto memories

We ate ghetto food, we wore ghetto clothes
Ended up being ghetto stars, driving our ghetto loads
With a diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' in the scene with a gansta lean ooh
Now I can clearly remember when it was cool
To do the Hammer dance
And everybody wore those pants
But back then I just couldn't afford it
And every now and then I reminisce about it
But its all good in the hood you know

No I don't have a girl I'm so trife

Without a clue that I'm coming to you tonight
She told me if I ever sneak she'd know
But she doesn't even know where I go
So like a fool to please my ego
I knocked her down like Ray Jones body blow

She'd laid it on me vicious no what I mean
Then granted me three wishes, now see
I don't want my girl to know where we be and
I don't want you to rock with nobody but me and
For my last wish I wanna know what the red
Light blinking is behind those blinds
She taped the whole thing and sent it to my girl
I'm Karma, vengeance is mine

Everything about her comes back around
K A are M A
Everything you do will find you somehow
K A are M A
On the card she left me was her name

Two weeks later I met this guy drinkin'
He looked down so I asked what he was thinkin'
He told me about this girl he met one weekend
He had a wife but she was so worth the sneakin'
He took her shoppin' even took her on a cruise
He had a alibi in Vegas which was cool
By the time he got home it was to late
Wife and kids was gone and on the floor there was a tape

She'd laid it on me vicious no what I mean

Know that Karma's looking for you, yea yea oh
You can't run, you can't hide
There's no use putting up a fight

Put out an A P be for this black girl
She's Chinese, no she's white, what in the world
Be on the look out 'cause she can change faces
And by the sound of things even change races
Please beware 'cause trouble make you weak
She's probably getting another victim as we speak
So check your record if you done any wrong

Dave Kelly,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance
Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go

As you take my hand and lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh

To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way

Dave Koz,"I've always believed in dreams
And that fantasies somehow come true
When dreaming of you
I've seen a moment's magic shine
Upon the darkest night
And fill it with light
I've heard the wind whisper melody
Of love meant to be
I've searched the heavens for you
I've searched heaven and earth
Chasing my dreams on the wings
Of everlasting love
I've searched through heaven and earth
Voicing the song my heart sings
Heaven help us find our love...love
I've wished on a thousand stars
Just for a sparkle to shine through
And lead me to you
Then you appeared as if by magic
Shined your love right into my life
Made everyday bright
So let the wind whisper melody
Of love meant to be
I've searched the heavens for you

But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I'm supposed to live
And now you showed me how to die

I was lost till Sunday morning
I work up to face my fear
While writing you this goodbye song
I found a tear

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in heaven
'Cause That's right where you want to be
I'm not cryin' cause I feel so sorry for you
I'm cryin' for me

I got up and dialed your number
And your voice came on the line
With that old familiar message
I'd heard a thousand times it just said
Sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and god bless
I know you think I'm crazy
But I had to hear your voice again

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in heaven
'Cause That's right where you want to be
I'm not cryin' cause I feel so sorry for you
I'm cryin' for me

So play your upside down left handed
Backwards bass guitar
And I'll see you on the other side

I'm gonna miss you my friend

And my Mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while the suckers cool every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us drive to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

We nah turn no stepper, things a go better
Never make yourself be overcome by pressure
Cool ya me bredda, have faith instead a
Sid-dung and a watch an all a fight one another
Blaze like fire, nah go retire
Got naf sleep and a him inspire
We fi reach higher a that him require
Haffi mek we mark before the time is expire

That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

And this hope
That keep me holding on

April gave us springtime and the promise of the flowers
And the feeling that we both shared and the love that we called ours
We knew no time for sadness, that's a road we each had crossed
We were living a time meant for us, and even when it would rain
we would laugh it off.

I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April, it's a morning in May

We stood on the crest of summer, beneath an oak that blossomed green
Feeling as I did in April, not really knowing what it means
But it must be then that you stand beside me now to make me feel this way
Just as I did in April, but it's a morning in May.

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,

And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

In his beat up pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her mercedes had a flat

He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
Till he said I'm here to help you mam
By the way, my name's Joe

She said I'm from st. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must of seen a hundred cars go by

And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away

Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way

But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must of been 8 months along
And dead on her feet

No she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill

The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she wrote

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

I need somebody or else I'm gonna die
Oh, love, if you need me
Just call and I'll be there

There is no sorrow that both of us can't share
That both of us can't share

Dave Mason,"Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key.

You feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself.

Well, say, you took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
That when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Gotta stop believin' in all you lies
Cause there's to much to do before I die.

You feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself.

Don't get too lost in all I say
Though at the time I really felt that way
But that was then, now it's today;
I can't get off so I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and, yes a different face.

You feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright? 
I'm not feelin' too good myself.",Feelin' Alright,1999

Dave Mason,"Here's a little song you can all join in with,
It's very simple and I hope it's new.
Make your own words up if you want to
Any old words that you think will do, yeah.
Yellow, blue, what'll I do? 
Maybe I'll just sit here thinking.
Black, white, stop the fight. 
Does one of these colours ever bother you?

Here's a little dance you can all join in with,
It's very simple and I hope it's new.
Make your own steps up if you want to
Any old steps that you think will do.
Left, right, don't get uptight.
Keep in line and you'll be alright.
Clap hands, move around 
And make sure no one puts you down.

Here's a little world you can all join in with,
It's very simple and I hope it's new.
Make your own life up if you want to
Any old life that you think will do.
Love, yeah, it's nothing new. 
There's someone much worse than you are.
Help me set them free,
Just be what you want to be.",You Can All Join In,1999
