Voz a Voz,"Todo el dia te recuerdo
Vives en mis pensamientos
Impregnada yo te llevo como esencia del mas caro fijador
Mi fragancia mas famosa de la barca mas costosa
Se compara con tu aroma que me dejas en los labios mi amor
Es tan fuerte este deseo soy adicto de tus besos
Del perfume que me dejas en la piel
Ni Dolce & Gabbana, ni Chanel, ni el mas dulce aroma de Cartier
Huelen tan bonito como huele la fragancia de tu ser
Ni el mas famoso ídolo francés hace que me muera de placer
Tu tienes la formula secreta que me hace enloquecer
El mejor perfume es el que dejas en mi piel
El mejor perfume es tu perfume de mujer

Es tan fuerte este deseo soy adicto de tus besos
Del perfume que me dejas en la piel
Ni Dolce & Gabbana, ni Chanel, ni el mas dulce aroma de Cartier
Huelen tan bonito como huele la fragancia de tu ser
Ni el mas famoso ídolo francés hace que me muera de placer
Tu tienes la formula secreta que me hace enloquecer
El mejor perfume es el que dejas en mi piel
El mejor perfume es tu perfume de mujer",El Mejor Perfume,2014
Voz de Mando   ,"Aprendí a vivir la vida
Después aprendí a Quitarla
Por ahí dijo un sabio chino
Vence al enemigo, sin darle batalla
Yo prefiero lo contrario
Me gusta la guerra
Cruzarme entre el fuego
Junto con mi raza

Con pechera o sin pechera
La neta pues me da igual
Por que un día e de morirme
Pero antes de irme , me voy a llevar
Varios tontos por delante
Por eso en terreno
Reglas de combate
Morir o matar

El carbón que a sido lumbre
Con facilidad se enciende
Al que me busque la espalda, yo le ayo la frente
Primo la vida es muy corta
Y yo quiero vivir la fuerte

Me he rodeado de enemigos
Unos vienen y otros van
Son parte de este negocio
Son contras o socios, ya ni se  con cual
Todos peleamos lo mismo
El poder respeto
La fama el dinero
La plaza ni hablar

Adictivo pa la muerte
Mi rifle lo proporciona
El se encarga de encenderme
Lo apunto de frente y solo se detona
E seguido un reglamento
Disparar primero, y a averiguar luego
Es mi estilo especial

El halcón manda un mensaje
Pal que pueda descifrar
El fin justifica los medios
Listo pa contraatacar
Once suman el apodo
Chequeen los versión no mas
Igual y no dice nada
No se dejen de preocupar",Estilo Especial,2010
Voz de Mando   ,"En un lugar muy lejano
Se reunieron varios
Hombres bien armados
Eran tres los arremangados
Andaban entrados
Planeando un asalto

R vamonos alistando
Prepara a los ántrax
Velos reforzando
Gonzalo la gente anda activa
Ahí viene el Ondeado
Trae a su cuadrilla
Así es compa vengo dispuesto
Pa' arremangar pelos
Ya mas no se diga
Rompan bien la filas
Póngase la pilas que llevo

Gonzalo a la orden
Manuel ya estoy listo
5-7 aquí estoy presente
Así los 3 mandos partieron
Vestidos de cuervo
Defendiendo el cerco

Gonzalo tira una granada
Mi rifle con banda
Arremanga parejo
Las pruebas han quedado claras
Paredes ventanas en polvo convierto

En vez de tirarles granadas
Traigo un jugetito
Que no creo que aguanten
Esta bazuka que me cargo
Bien me ha funcionado
No mi comandante

Macho Prieto
Estoy en aprietos
Pero no me dejo
El 50 ya esta cargado
Voy a detonarlo
Y terminar con esto

Yo Traigo bazukas
Yo le entro parejo
Los antrax somos muy violentos
Antitanques, Virus, cuchillos
Complemento activo
Y finos movimientos
El objetivo esta muy claro
Defender al Mayo

Voz de Mando   ,"Que estamos molestos, sufriendo por nada
Aunque te digo un secreto, te miras linda enojada
En verdad lo siento regalame una mirada
Sabes te hice un par de versos que me salieron del alma
Te hice un par de versos le mezcle guitarra
Tal como lo siento con estas palabras,
Me inspire en tus besos, tu linda mirada
Dueña de mis sueños, mi niña
Adorada!

Aun con las batallas tu tienes el trono
Mi amor todo aguanta me sabes el modo
Tengo la esperanza que se arregle todo
Porque tu me amas, yo te amo a lo tonto
Te digo lo siento con estas palabras

No encuentro la calma mejor
Dame un beso

Voz de Mando   ,"Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil

Soy la gota de agua
Emanando en la selva en el sureste de Asia
Vuelo por los cielos en una botella a otro continente
Mi misión es tu boca tocar deshacerme en tu paladar
Cuando voy a cazarte
Tus labios me evaporan con un par de palabras de fuego

Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil

Y un camino de largo se cruza descalzo
Sobre el sacrificio
Por la santa indicada yo me iría de rodillas
Al final de los tiempos

Mas distante que un viaje lunar
Mas difícil que un secreto guardar
Eres como una rosa que dispara sus espinas antes de aspirar su aroma

Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil
Para poder llegar a ti es todo tan difícil
Todo tan difícil, todo tan difícil",Para Poder Llegar a Ti,2014
Voz de Mando   ,"Juré que no iba a verte
Mucho menos a enloquecerme
Pero no sé
Que has hecho en mi
Es tu veneno que lentamente
Se apodera de mis deseos 
Y me ahogan todos tus besos
No puedo hablar
Solo sentir 
Como estremeces todo mi cuerpo

Y tu bien sabes que no fui yo
No es culpable la situación
Que quede claro por esta vez 
Que sólo eres tu
Solamente tu
La que con dulzura entiende mis palabras 
Y ama mi locura
La que me domina con una sonrisa
Pintada en sus labios
La que entrega todo sin pedirme nada
Sólo que la ame
La que en silencio logra todo en mi
Sólo con un beso 

Quisiera vestir tu cuerpo 
De caricias que llevo dentro 
Y disfrutar un poco más
Hasta perderme por un momento 

Y tu bien sabes que no fui yo
Es culpable la situación
Que quede claro por esta vez oh
Que sólo eres tu
Solamente tu
La que con dulzura entiende mis palabras 
Y ama mi locura

Voz de Mando   ,"Se me antoja un caldito de águila helado
De esos que ponen alegre al amargado

Un remedio que esta más que comprobado
Ambientado pone hasta al más apagado

Con un doce en el sistema mucha gente se a curado
Ya se plata o colorado y titanio los más bravos

Este caldo viene frío y enlatado
Se consume con amigos y hasta extraños

Especial si con mujeres es tomado
Se hace en fiestas cotorreos en cualquier lado

Sabe amargo pero bueno bien macizo el resultado
Lo que inicia calmadito termina bien entonado

Como todo tiene efectos secundarios
A unos cuantos este caldo les cae malo

De dolores de cabeza se han quejado
Lengua seca y uno que otro deguansado

Un clavo saca otro clavo varias veces lo he aplicado
Al que se eche otro plateado como nuevo y relajado

Es muy práctico este liquido enlatado
Por que fácilmente se toma empinado

En las playas en los antros y hasta estadios
En la calle los palenques y los ranchos

También si andas caminando o en la troca ruleteando
Al lomo de un buen caballo o en la banqueta sentado

Hacen que hasta el más miedoso agarre huevos
A unos pone cariñosos o violentos

Si no te quieren un chingo buscan pleito
Pero eso si pone interesante el cuento

A otros por la madrugada les entra lo enamorados
Y si se acaban el saldo a que hueva da lidiarlos

Como todo tiene efectos secundarios
A unos cuantos este caldo les cae malo

Die sich an die Industrie verkaufen
Ihr verdient damit 'nen riesen Haufen

Die dürre Zeit ist vorbei, hier kommt das Stylegewitter
Für die Fans da draußen wie Scheibenwischer
Im Battle machst du dich lächerlich wie Oli Pocher
Denn ich hab einiges drauf wie 'n Doppel Whopper
Mach wannabe MCees platt mit meiner lockeren Art
Schneller als KRS-One Officer sagt
Heutzutage wissen Rapper nicht mal mehr was 'ne Crate ist
Kennen Platten nur von ihrem fetten Mercedes
Ausgedachte Gangster so wie Tingeltangelbob
Ich fühl mich wie der Kindergartencop
Denn mir sind diese Affen zu poppig
Ohne Knete sind die nix so wie Wallace und Gromit

Ihr werdet klein wie ein Hobbit ist MC Streichholz am Mic
Alles klar die Crowd hat den Vergleich schon gepeilt
Ihr habt keine Ahnung von Hip Hop keine Haare am Sack
Nur Dollarzeichen in den Augen so wie Dagobert Duck
Auf Technobeats kannst du bei uns lange warten, die Industrie voller Angelhaken
Deep wie der Mariannengraben, Weed in unseren Kapillaren

Über den Beat so kinderleicht als ob's das Einmaleins ist
Und weil hier jede Line sitzt als hätt' sie Stubenarrest
Geb ich whack MC's auf Yokai-Beats übermies den Rest
Und ich bringe meine Styles in die exquisite Reimform
Wär' Rap ein Marathon dann läge ich schon lange weit vorn
Gib mir das Micphone und spitz ihr jetzt eure Lauscher
Auf der Bühne geh ich ab (ja!) wie David der Klabauter
Ich bin ein Oldtimer, 84'er Baujahr
Läuft mein Tape im Deck, dann machst du erst mal lauter
Der ewige selige Flow geschmeidig wie Seide
Dein schäbigen mehligen Flow schieb' ich beiseite
Stift ab!

Masta Mike, ich kick' die Styles in der Booth durch die Membrane
Denn gute Flows sind bei mir das A und O wie Vokale
Aha! Fanta Yokai macht die Beats klar, verstehste?
Und du bleibst auf der Strecke so wie Navigationsgeräte
Macht mal Lärm man für VSK
Denn alles andere wäre mir schleierhaft wie grauer Star
Ende, verlaub ich war schon immer der beste MC

Christus hatte nur zwei Follower, Flowbotta raucht dich wie 'ne Gauloise
In hundert Jahren battlet dich mein Hologramm
Auch wenn die Majorlabel jeden Hebel in Bewegung setzten um die Kids zu blenden
Werde ich kein Influencer, werde ich kein Modeblogger
Ich bleibe der Flow-Roboter, man ich hab 'ne Schraube locker
Ich muss auf 'ne Hebebühne
Wenn du den lyrischen Cyborg battleln willst, dann bist du Lebensmüde (haha!)

Hier kommt die Sagen umwobende, Rapper plagende, tobende
Unter Tage wohnende, nichts und niemand verschonende
Fette Phrasen androhende Flow-Granate namens Podwich
Du denkst es gibt keine besseren am Mic als dich? Doch mich!
Ich sprenge die Cypher voller Eifer
Brülle: „Wer will battleln?“
Und findet sich ein Volldidiot, kriegt er 'nen Denkzettel
Ich bin kein Geld wie Heu verdienender Trendcharts Analytiker
Sondern Hip Hop treu gebliebener mit Punchlines wie Politiker

Auch ohne Textblatt mach ich all die Whacks platt

Wir sind on Top und wurden wieder mal vom Blitz getroffen
Und stehen unter Strom um wieder derbe zu Rocken

Flowbotta, mein Gehirn ist eine Festplatte
Wir sind Skilliardäre, wir sind Freshdachse
Es macht „ZZ ZZ“ und die Kanne klackert
Weil ich meinen Crewnamen an die Wand geklatscht hab
Freestyle für drei Stunden aber niemand ist genervt
Ich mach Feuer in dein Ohr wie ein türkischer Friseur
Bei uns wird Graffiti nicht nur an die Wand geprayt
Ich mach auch Bodypaint

Wir sind dann einfach VSK (Maschine und Masta)
Schönen Guten Tag (Podwich und Bleier)
Wir sind keine Stars (Botta und Streicher)
Kicken einfach nur Bars und das war's gebt uns Love
Wir sind doch einfach VSK

Wen dürfen wir nicht vergessen den DJ Ratzefummel
Den ganzen Tag mit der Machete im Plattendschungel
Nur die guten ins Töpfchen, so wie bei Aschenputtel
Er hat vom ganzen gejuggle schon einen Katzenbuckel

Gebt mir ein Ho
Gebt mir ein Yeah
Gebt mir ein Yo
Wir sind halt einfach VSK",Schönen Guten Tag,2018

Geht es um Hip Hop, werde ich zum Dichter und Denker wie Goethe
Geht's um Whackies, werde ich zum Richter und Henker und töte
Aber natürlich nur Lyrisch, denn Gewalt ist was für Asis
Anstatt mich rumzuraufen, hab ich Spaß mit meinen Buddies
Ihr stinkt ab wie ein Trabbi gegen VSKawasaki ladidadi
Wir stehlen euch die Show, auf eurer Party
Werdet heute alle Zeuge, denn wir rocken jetzt die Meute
Werden rasten aus vor Freude, VSK ist im Gebäude

Dann kann's ja losgehen, wie'n Blindgänger
VSK, MC Streichholz schießt die Flows durch die Stimmbänder
Wenn ich morgens aufsteh', was auf dem Sampler loope
Hab ich nur noch Bock auf HipHop und schwänz' die Schule
Icke, Schreibmaschine, Master Podwich, Flowbotta, Bleier

Auf'm Splash auftreten ist 'n Kindheitstraum

Gib mir ein Mic denn ich bin down mit dem Shit
Laufend die Hits am schreiben

Als ob es für uns einfach nichts anderes gibt
Simma down - Ja auf jeden Fall das sind wa
Wir haben ne große Klappe doch da steckt auch was dahinter
Wie ein Strafzettel hinterm Scheibenwischer
Und eins ist sicher: Whack MCs werden verputzt wie ein Snickers

Und ist das Leben mal bitter wie ne Pampelmuse
Mach ich mir Zucker drauf, dreh die Mucke laut
Und tanz durch die ganze Bude, props an die alte Schule
Das hier ist das erste deutsche Rapalbum seit ""Bambule""
Und lässt die Arme hoch gehen wie ein Deostick
Und andere Rapper blass aussehen wie im Neonlicht
Ich bin kein Schäferhund, doch du kannst mir blind vertrauen
Lass mich den Spliff anhauen und dann Simma down

Als wir schon Züge besprühten wart ihr im Kindergarten
Wir sind real scheiß egal was all die Spinner sagen
Und feilten schon an tighten Flows bereits im Kinderwagen
Ganz egal auf welche Jam wir sind dahin gefahren
Wir haben die Trends gesetzt wie fette Tags im Bus
Und halten immer noch zusammen wie ein Klettverschluss
Ob vor dem Frühstück oder nach dem Abendbrot
Ich muss immer bauen
Tüte angehauen, ja da Simma down

Ey yo bei Freestyles mit Schimpfwörtern - Simma nich down
Den B-Girls an den Hintern grabschen - Simma nich down
DJ mach die Platte aus - oh oh
Denn wir sind hier nicht im Affenhaus - jagajau
Ey die Breakdancemoves sind anatomisch nicht möglich
Der menschliche Körper wird verbogen wie Brezeln
Wenn du Flowbotta die Mütze klaust fliegt du raus
Halt dich an die Spielregeln und dann sind wir down

VSK,"Es war einmal ein B-Girl ausm Viertel aus der Gegend
Sie war bei jeder Jam sagte HipHop sei ihr Leben
Ihre Kollegen wenn du mich fragst sind das Whackies ohne Peilung
Doch diese eine Lady hatte mehr als tighte Kleidung
Bauchtanz zu (?) bauchfrei und Baggypants
Mit geschlossenen Augen lieferte sie 'ne Show wie Eminem
So dass jeder Daddy denkt Stop Digger
Jeder Rap von dieser Dame war einfach ein Kopfnicker
Und es kam noch dicker als wir ihr die Reimketten beibrachten
Dieses Baby ließ sich niemals von der Polizei busten
Wenn wir Trains machten wenn wir beatboxten
Sie war der Grund dass sogar wir mal einmal Beef hatten
Aber digger dieser Lidschatten
Mann und noch etwas tiefer ihre Dienstwaffe
Und wie ihre Jeans passten ja die hat sich rausgeputzt
Und dann jeden von uns nacheinander ausgenutzt

Tatiana was du abgezogen hast war echt derbe
Tatiana, warst wie das Schneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge
Doch in Wahrheit warst du nie eine Schwester
Andere Mütter haben auch schöne Töchter

Weißt du noch Tatiana hinter der war jeder her
Sie war das einzige Girl auf dem Curse Konzert
Damn sie hat gebeatboxt und wir rappten
Sie verdrehte uns den Kopf wie ein Headspin
Als sie mir die Nummer mit dem Edding auf mein Arm getaggt hat
Hat es geknistert wie das Vinyl auf dem Plattenteller
Und als wir scratchten da berührten sich die Hände
Ich die Fillings sie die Outlines so beschmierten wir die Wände
Für mich hat sie 'nen Beat gebastelt Junge Mann das war ein Brett
Mir hat sie was vorgerappt und für 'ne Frau wars gar nicht schlecht
Ich sagte du bist Joy und ich dein Max Herre
Liebe kommt nicht mit 'nem Beipackzettel
Ich dachte für Tatiana bin ich was besonderes
Doch warum rappt sie immer nur die Texte von den anderen mit
Und ich dachte, dass Tatiana nur den Botta liebt
Doch sie hatte was mit jedem aus dem Kollektiv

Tatiana was du abgezogen hast war echt derbe
Tatiana, warst wie das Schneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge
Doch in Wahrheit warst du nie eine Schwester

Beim ersten Blickkontakt damals auf der Freestylesession
Podwich stand neben mir und ich gab grad einen zum Besten
Masta war derbe am Rappen ich biggediboxte den Beat
Du hast mich angesehen Baby ich war sofort verliebt
Dieses Gefühl was ich verspürte war mir so nicht geläufig
Dass die Chemie zwischen uns beiden stimmte merkte ich deutlich
Mit deiner rassigen Löwenmähne zogst du mich in dein Bann
Und mir war klar irgendwann ziehen wir beide zusammen
Ach du meine Güte sie kam immer näher Richtung Bühne
Zwinkerte mir zu als ich in meinem Kopf nach Reimen wühlte
Mike vergeigte den Reim und mir missglückte der Beat
Sie lief an uns beiden vorbei das war das Ende vom Lied
Mit geschlossenen Augen offenen Armen und gespitzten Lippen
Wartete ich auf meinen Schatz aber da hatte ich mich geschnitten
Sie lief an uns vorbei und zu allem Überfluss
Gab sie DJ Ratzefummel einen Zungenuss

VSK,"HipHop das Lingo meiner Wahl versteht man international
Ich sehe mich grad noch als Kind Tags mit der Fingerfarbe malen
Habe kein Geld gebunkert doch bin reich an Erfahrungen
Denn selbst mit hundert bleibe ich ein Weltenbummler
Einmal um die Erde wie Magellan weil ich lernen will wie ein Padawan
Immer nur der Nase nach nein ich habe keinen Masterplan
Ob trampen bis Kasachstan oder zur Jam mit dem Fahrrad fahren
Für HipHop bin ich bereit Opfer zu bringen wie Abraham

Der rappende Scharlatan M-A-S-T-A
Mache den Kram seit Beginn in den frühen Neunzigern für den Sprachgesang
Ein HipHop Vagabund mit Griff zu den Sternen
Es geht von Kontinent zu Kontinent als wäre ich Jules Verne
In 80 Tagen um die Welt mit Stift und Papier
In jeder Stadt mein Kürzel an den Wänden zeigt ich war hier
Weil 1 mal 1 gleich 2 anstatt nur 1 ist die Symbiose der Beweis ist mit dem Mic
Bis sich der Kreis schließt im Angesicht des Reimes

Kleiner die Antwort ist so einfach dass es jeder versteht
Bonjour buenos dias cest la vie konichiwa
HipHop ist multilingual bitte merk dir das mal

Verbales Style Kollektiv bei uns geht es nicht nur um Eigenlob
HipHop 5 Elemente vielseitig wie ein Kaleidoskop
In jeder Stadt auf der Welt hab ich Genossen und Mitstreiter
Wir gehen sie zusammen die Sprossen der Strickleiter
Kraft durch Fläche gleich Druck HipHops Fläche der Globus
Die Industrie kann nach Hause gehen mit dem Hokus Pokus
Und auch wenn ich die meisten Länder sicher niemals besuche
Weiß ich dort schlagen Herzen mit neunzig Beats pro Minute

Sind alles Brüder und Schwestern mit dem selben Denken
Weil wir mit vereinten Kräften für die selbe Sache kämpfen
Für den Erhalt von HipHop und seinen Elemente
Diese Kultur kennt keine Grenzen Religionen oder Hautfarbe
Ist scheißegal das nenn' ich meine Aussage
Und warum ich bei 'nem Battle nicht gleich draufschlage
Brothershake digger Respekt ist die Hauptsache

Wir batteln im Vatikan Breakdancen mit Taliban
Beatboxen in Afrika in Klicklauten mit Kannibalen
Ein Eskimo will freestylen ich sag wie du willst
Fliege bis zum Nordpol spucke Feuer bis das Iglu schmilzt
In meiner Welt da gibts nur fünf Sprachen Graffiti und Beatboxen

VSK,"Chiggedicheck das ab check das ab weil ich jetzt komme
Ich komme jetzt wie Oskar endlich raus aus meiner Tonne
Glattrasiert wie Gilette repräsentier ich Sonnenbrille
Bin auch gern dabei mit meinen Homies rumzuchillen
Auch gegen deinen Willen werd ich dir jetzt was zeigen
Auch ohne Mikrofon bring ich Wackies zum Schweigen
Lehne dich zurück lass dich von meinem Skill befallen
Wie sagt man an Silvester jetzt lass die Korken knallen
'N fetten Bett und 'n Girl an jedem Finger
Wir verbreiten Flow wir sind die Flowüberbringer
Also lerne und hör gut zu was wir dir rocken
Wir kommen whack MCee machen dich weg wie dicke Brocken

Ich hab den Namen an die Wand mit der Kanne gedrückt
Gottverdammt da wird der Hund in der Pfanne verrückt
Wack MCees lassen wir mit 'ner Panne zurück
Und der Beat wird mit Styles wie 'ne Tanne geschmückt
Mc Bleistift fragen mich die Leute
Spittest du für Cash oder spittest du für Bräute
Nein ich spitte Bars für die Community und nicht fürs eigene Ego
Und bleibe tief im Untergrund versteckt wie Captain Iglu

Bin der Freestyleking und battle dich in jeder Lebenslage
Meine Skills sind unfassbar wie Edelgase
Spitte das pure Leben wie ein Samenleiter
Hänge mit den Jungs hier in der Ecke auf der Partycypher
Rapper zeigen nicht wer sie sind wie beim Maskenball
Der Flow ist flüssig denn er fließt wie ein Wasserfall
Meine wohlgewählten Worte sprudeln wie beim Overkill
Sorry du musst die Party verlassen wenn du koksen willst
Girls shaken den Booty zum Bass
Stell alles auf den Kopf du denkst du hast 'nen Looping gemacht
Yayau die meisten Leude reden zu viel
Hiphop ist keine Musik sondern ein Lebensgefühl

Vsk ein Anruf doch das ist nicht die Frage
Mc Brille ist am Start ja Mann heute und die Tage
Die Cypher die rockt die Freizeit wird geblockt
Und wenns halt nicht so läuft wird erst mal Kaffee schön gekocht
Ne Kippe hinterher MC Brille gefällts
Die besten Beats sind für mich Hundegebell
Ich war früher schon am Start undercover unterwegs
Ich bin süchtig nach der Scheiße wie das Krümelmonster nach dem Keks

Check check mach mir den Beat mal bitte extralaut
Yokai ist kein Tischler doch hat wieder mal 'nen Brett gebaut
Für die wahren Kenner auf deine Plattenteller
Ihr macht Mucke nur für Kiddies wie der Rattenfänger
Bist nur hier für den kostenlosen Schnaps
Und den Freestyle haste letzte Woche schon gebracht
Doch da drück ich mal ein Auge zu wie Slick Rick

Nick mit dem Kopf und du hast den Groove
Und wer diesen Groove hier hat braucht kein Substitut
Es ist nicht was du laberst es ist was du tust
Jeder kehrt vor seiner Tür und es wird alles gut
Unsere Waffe die Sprache VSK und MC Maultasche
Ich bin der Froschkönig und du nur eine Kaulquappe
Alle wollen nur Moneten es geht immer um den Tauschwert
Gib mir 'ne Kot Bro dieser Flow ist eine Faust wert

Der Beat läuft wie alles was zwei Beine hat
Denn Jesse MC ist am Start
Das minderjährige Raptalent aus dem Hinterland
Macht Schlagzeilen mit dem Mic in der Hand
Was Whatsapp der Shit interessiert mich nicht
Wilde Lines on the street, du kleiner Fisch
Denn ich bin ausm HipHop
Bis zum nächsten Mal wenn ich mir das Mic schnapp

Digga, du weißt wie ich heiß Charlie Chill ist am Start
Für diesen Part hab ich ein Blick in meine Kugel gewagt
Achtung Achtung HipHop ist in großer Gefahr
Denn statt fette Flows zählt halt nur noch Modegeschmack
Statt Rucksack nur Bauchtasche Party und Drogen
Wenn wir nicht aufpassen leben bald nur noch Archäologen
Und damit die mehr finden als unsere dünnen Skelette
Bündelt die Kräfte für das Kollektiv fünf Elemente

Hater kommen darauf nicht klar so wie ich grade flow
Und machen ständig große Augen als hätten die Deppen Basedow
Du willst mich im Battle Bro kein Problem
Catch me if you can als wär ich Leonardo DiCaprio
Ich bin immer noch der Dude der in die Crowd ballert
Indem er Rhymes spittet am Mic als wär er auf Kautabak
Schick dich zurück wie auf Replay
Denn alles was du machst ist für die Katz wie die Platten für DJ

Als ich noch jünger war da hatte mich noch gar nichts geschockt
Dann hörte ich den Prinzen und hatte auf nachdenken Bock
Donnerwetter alea iacta est
Die Würfel waren gefallen ich schrieb mein allerersten Text
Alle waren geflasht wer ist dieser Conny Blunt
Immer voll entspannt wie auf der Sonnenbank
Wie ich meine Bong im Schrank verstecken sich die MCees
Jetzt will ich die Hände sehen und nicht die Handys

Hoppala der Beat knallt wie Nappaleder
Macht sogar den Mathelehrer zum Kappeträger
Wenn der DJ die Platte cuttet wie Hackepeter
Tanzen die Girls zu Rockefeller den Macarena
Und Jungs nicken mit dem Kopf
Denn wir sind alle dicke mit dem (?)
Servier die Styles eiskalt nach Hause wie Mövenpick
Der Name Ben Zin und ich bin draußen wie Köpenick

Gibbedigib mir das Mic
Oder seid ihr nicht bereit für die ganz frischen Styles
Rap ist Liebe und Respekt und wenn du das nicht checkst
Wirst du lyrisch zerfetzt das ist VSK Gesetz
Faker haben hier keine Chance
So wie Biggie Smalls bei 'ner Tour de France
Leute hören Techno doch ich liebe Raps und Beats
Also geb ich das Mic weiter an den nächsten dope MCee

Hevrikano ist ein Gaucho
Tighte Rhymes auf deine Couch yo
Ich streu die Skills wie Parmesano über Bars wie Esco Pablo
Die Saga kommt in News VSK der Navigator
Wie Santa Cruz immer ausgebucht niemals ausgebuht
Keine Maskerade Hevrikano ist kein Halbblut
Wir kämpfen gegen Armut mit den Gezeiten bis zur Sintflut
Wir skateten die Pipes, damals sprühten wir die Vibes
Wir kickten tighte Rhymes jo wir potteten die Nikes

Yo, Gelbe Karte an alle Faschos

Mütze schief Büchse tief
Richtig erkannt Herr Detektiv
Wir sind HipHop aktiv aber immer positiv
Unser Name ist Verbales Style Kollektiv
(?) Geht ab wie Wasserfarbe
Besser als der Edding den ich immer in der Tasche trage
Um das Tag meiner Crew in die Welt zu malen
Wir sind die Derbsten brauch ich gar nicht weiter prahlen

Vsk machen jeden platt von Rügen bis Basel
Mcees sind Headsets gewohnt und stolpern über das Kabel
Ich roll ein so wie Züge im Bahnhof
So high hier geht gleich der Fliegeralarm los
Mal wieder ein MCee da auf Viva der nix kann
Da krieg ich son Hals wie Big Pun
Freestyler from the top of the Dome
Wir haben kein Karies aber kriegen trotzdem fünf Kronen

Ey yo ich bin Skinny Cap und mal die Train für die Crew
Ab und an wird man erwischt gehört halt dazu
Doch davon lass ich mich nicht unterkriegen
Ich bin jeden Tag im Yard
Mit Chrome, Schwarze, einem Marker und (?)
Schon oft wurde es knapp doch wir komm immer davon

Die Leute schreien Vandalismus mir tut das bitterleid
Wegen meiner Leidenschaft steigt der Ticketpreis

Direkt aus dem Heim das HipHop Urgestein
Horst Schweinebeck rund um die Uhr am Rhymen
Mein Enkel Podwich hat mir von der Cypher erzählt
Und jetzt steht er hier am Mic der alte Weibermagnet
86 Jahre alt aber der Flow ist tiptop
Wer will mir was erzählen über Oldschool HipHop
Mein Rollstuhl getuned wie das Batmobil
Macht mal Lärm Leute für das Riggedi Rapfossil

Hier kommt n großer Brummer direkt aus der Zone
Mein Flow ist locker cremig wie der Joghurt von Danone
Gangsterrap wär mir die Kohle nicht wert
Ich geh zum Battle wie die Lottozahlen ohne Gewehr
Peace mein Rap ist wie 'ne Tiefkühlbox
Ziemlich cool aber auch deepe Kost
Für mich ist Lasertag spielen das gleiche wie rappen
Ich schieße aber ich will keinen verletzen

Ich hab den (W)Rap im Gepäck wie ein Dürümverkäufer
Weil euch schmeckt was ich rappe bekommt ihr immer 'nen Nachschlag
Mc Klaviatur denn ich bin schwarz und weiß
Halb Ägypter und halb Deutscher deshalb flow ich so nice
Fick auf euren Beweis eyo das hab ich nicht nötig
Vsk ist die HipHop Crew von der ich Respekt krieg
Um deine Alte abzuschießen brauch ich keine Patrone
Bist du vom Himmel gefallen du siehst aus wien toter Vogel

Mama war enttäuscht ich hab für Rap die Uni abgebrochen
Heute ist sie stolz ihr Junge bringt die Cypher zum Kochen
Mc Giraffe der Lulatsch mit den lustigen Strophen
Und 'nem Style der so frisch ist wie die Luft hier oben
Lauter Bobbycar MCees während ich lyrisch Motorrad fahre
Mit derben Raps die dich wegflashen wie 'ne Kokanase
Eyo ich hoffe ihr versteht diese Line
Nur als Metapher lasst die Finger von dem chemischen Scheiß

I came in a street near a very big hotel
And there is a boy who wants to kick a girl
The girl cries and she lays on the street
I went to the boy and kicked him with my feet
Then the boy runs away and the girl got up
Excuse me guys but I cant stop
And when I suddenly heard a voice
I saw in front of me a group of many boys
I got on running with the girl hand in hand
Because I knew that the boys (?)

Das ist die Trueschool und ich halte am Mic meinen Einserschnitt
Deine goldene Kette gleicht einem Galgenstrick
Niemand wird als King geboren und sei es per Kaiserschnitt
Ich mach den Headspin so schnell ich reis in der Zeit zurück
Wir zeigen Skills und drehen uns auf dem Teer
Doch vor dem Breakdancebattle wird sich erst aufgewärmt
Props an meine Jungs die damals schon die Höhle bemalten

New York New York das HipHop Mekka
Als deutscher Touri traut man sich dort nicht zum Bäcker
Mein Traum war immer schon mal darüber zu fliegen
Ich wollte Bambaataas Füße massieren
In der Bronx hab ich mir in die Hose geschissen
Doch bin kurz ausgestiegen um den Boden zu küssen
Dort wurde in den 70s der HipHop geboren
Damit die Gangs aufhören mit dem sinnlosen Morden

Ich komm auf die Party und die Girls drehen auf
Denn ich bin dieser eine Rapper mit dem dirty Sound
Und auch wenn ich mir 'nen Kopf stopf für die roten Glotzböbbel
Bring ich doch noch Aktivflow wie 'ne Atombombe Rotzlöffel
Nur die da oben wissen was kommt
Denn ich hebe die Faust gegen das System an der Front
Majorlabels wollen unsere Bewegung zensieren
Doch ich lass mich nicht verbieten und ich lass mich nicht verbiegen, no

Der Moses der Scratches der over den Heads ist
Ein großes Vermächtnis (DJ Ratzefummel!)
Er schaut von oben auf das Trauerspiel herab
Und fragt sich was soll (dieser ganze Rummel!)
Der eine oder andere Dussel macht sich über Ratze lustig
Und sagt er muss immer schmunzeln bei den überkrassen Muskeln
Daraufhin sagt Ratzefummel lieber hab ich Wackelpudding Arme
Anstatt dass ich Lieder mach die dumm kling'n, Amen

Hänge hier hänge da hänge wo die wilden Kerle flowen

Graviation oder ein Magnet
Gewinne den Pokal denn ich bin der Rhymemagnet
Darf ich mich mal vorstellen Doktor Majake
Kleb am Mikrofon wie am Finger Marmelade
Habe den derben Flow habe den derben Style
Und alle Whackies auf der Bühne werden kreidebleich

VU Project,"If you need a friend,
Don't look to a stranger,
You know in the end, I'll always be there.
And when you're in doubt,
And when you're in danger,
Take a look all around,
And I'll be there.

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me, I promise, I promise you I will.

When your day is through, and so is your temper,
You know what to do, I'm gonna always be there.
Sometimes if I shout, it's not what's intended.
These words just come out, with no gripe to bear.

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.

I'll make you fall for me, I promise, I promise you I will.

It was huge, it was angry
It was drawing near
Behind his house a secret place
Was the shadow of the demon

And men with guns to keep it tame
Then standing back he made it plain
That the nightmare would never ever rise again
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain

He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
It slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping 

And then one day the neighbors came
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame
They stood around outside the wall
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all

The threat is under firm control
As long as peace and order reign
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain""

Don't know the whole world's changing
As you sleep through the night
Wake up slowly and it's a different world

Hear the news and the floods begin
Screams so loud but only felt within
Heart is shattered
The pieces can't be found

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you he would want you to

Months go by still living in a daze
Don't know what you've done
With the last seven days
Soul is numb and life is like a dream

Helping hands but you push them away
How could they understand
Don't wanna share your pain
Afraid to heal 'cause that would mean goodbye

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you, she would want you to

One day sunlight hits a photograph
And it makes you smile
The memories dance around you now
And they make you smile

You're not alone, you'll never be
Just like the stars they oversee
And they whisper to you you're still, you're still
You're still, you're still alive

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you, they would want you to

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there, I do not sleep
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow

I am the sun on ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn rain
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush

Of quiet birds in circled flight
I am the soft stars that shine at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there, I did not die

Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (i was just frontin')
I'm ready to stop when you are

You have the best for texture feel

Now for my love for you in time will reveal
Mi a go make you wear a ring like shaquille o' neal
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real, you know

You can get wet for real this ain't a mirage 
These are treacherous waters with dangerous sharks 
When my pacers were gone, I came from the heart 
The realness gave me my start I'm here playin my part 
Like an illustrious picture, your face in my palm 
When the game is on the line I'm amazingly calm

But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (i was just frontin')

Vybz Kartel,"Walking down the road this life is on
The narrow path I try to stay
But I must confess I have a tendency to stray
I'd love to call it a mistake
A momentary lapse of faith
But the truth is sometimes I feel like I'm being dragged away

By the other side that people never see
A war is on between the good and bad inside of me

[Chorus]
Why do I do all the things that I do
When I want to do what is right
Change this wicked heart of mine
Let me walk with you in the new life

So what will ever put an end
To my recurring bout with sin
It seems I'm always at a loss for a way to win
When what I really need to do
Is to confront it with the truth
And let Your words of life sink in and make my mind brand new

A transformation that happens over time
Is the product of a renewed mind

Create in me a clean heart
Place Your spirit deep inside
Capture every thought
Til there's no place left to hide

[Chorus]",Why?,2003

(Ladies insist that we start well)

I am dangerous, yay!!! I am dangerous, yay!!! (Now wheel!!!) 

[Verse 1: Cormega] 
Like City Of God adversity is Medusa's curse I been hard when facin admeasurable odds 
I clearly evolve like Bibby when Webber was Gone 
The jewels keep me cool when the weather is warm 
The Coups be as hot as the strip that we on 
Though I'm dealin no more I'm here with cess me import 
You can get wet for real this ain't a mirage 
These are treacherous waters with dangerous sharks 
When my pacers were gone, I came from the heart 
The realness gave me my start I'm here playin my part 
Like an illustrious picture, your face in my palm 
When the game is on the line I'm amazingly calm 
Whether I'm in the streets or a Jamaican resort 
I'm a stay doin me that's the way I was taught 
Destined for greatness success breeds hatred 
I can't see in the hearts of man I just see paper 

[Chorus:] 
Dangerouuuuuuuussssssssssss!!!!!!! 
I am dangerous, yay!!! I am dangerous, yay!!! 

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel] 
Hey! We dangerous like a Taliban 
With knives, hostages and two jumbo jets 
More dangerous than unprotected sex 
AK's ninja teck's, fi day to day flex 
Swords and machete, too petty, Spears, fi Britney 
Bows and arrows don't fit mi 
HK dangerous like Bobby Brown to Whitney 
Murder from di elderly to pickney 
America's Most Wanted, starrin Kartel and Cormega 
We on CNN not Capone-N-Noreaga

We spray bullet inna yuh face like make up and lip stick

W.A.S.P.,"I was born Jonathon Aaron Steel, to the parents of William and Elizabeth
steel. I am a Leo, born under the sign of the lion and I was raised in a
lower middle class family with only one brother Michael whom I love
dearly. He was five years my senior. My father's nickname was Red which I
could never understand why because his hair was sandy blond. Nevertheless,
the name stuck. So when my brother was born my father became Big Red and
my brother Little Red. I should have known from the first time when I
realised their special connection, that I just didn't fit in to my
father's plans. And as I grew older the constant comparison between my
brother and myself left little doubt who was the image of perfection in my
father's eye. To him, my brother could do no wrong and I became The
Invisible Boy, the proverbial 'black sheep' and I soon figured out that
red and black don't mix. The beatings I received became more and more
frequent to the point where I would ask my father ""Am I the orphaned son
you would never need""? But oddly enough I worshipped the ground my father
walked upon.

My brother and I were a strange mixture, as different as daylight and
dark. Looking back, it's hard to imagine we came from the same parents. I
sometimes wondered if we had the same father, but I always dismissed that
idea as my mother was far too religious, my father as well, to ever even
think of such a thing. But my brother who had always sensed my parent's
instilled insecurities tried his best to encourage me. For I was born
different and he knew it. He often told me when I was born an angel flew
over my bed and christened me with a magic wand and said ""You shall be the
one"". And I had no idea what 'The one' was, but as I grew older I began to
understand. Most boys put their mother on a pedestal and worship them like
the Virgin Mary but with her too my relationship was different and not for
the good. She was opinionated, uneducated, sometimes prejudiced,
overbearing, believed everything she read, true or not, and when it came
to religion was over-zealous to say the least. A mind boggling combination
but she was pretty, very pretty and I would often wonder, bordering on
complete confusion, how a person of this description could rationalise life.

This was a series of characteristics that many times in my life I would
look back on in bewilderment and the women I sought after when I was older
would be nothing like her. In the pain of youth, the misery of my neglect,
would manifest itself in many ways; depression - my enemy, fear - my
friend, hatred - my lover, and anger - fuel for my fire. These four
characteristics of my personality would become the guiding force of my
life and would control everything I did or was to become. I shall explain
later in the story about them which I call my Four Doors of Doom.

The mirror, the great plaything for man's vanity. The mirror was to
become, at times, my altar of refuge and other, my alter ego and its
magnificent obsession with a relentless pursuit of attention. It served as
a chilling reflection of my own wretchedness and my greatness. It was the
one place I could go to see inside myself, to find love, in an otherwise
loveless household where I could be great, where I could be anything or
anyone I wanted to be - one hundred percent pure escapism until I
discovered its precious secret. The mirror lives, it breathes, it talks,
it lies, it has a personality all its own. It is a genie that grants all
the wishes you could ever dream, at least in my case - all except two.

It was my 14th birthday, the day that changed my life forever. My brother
Michael, the one person who was my guiding light, my friend, my hero, was
killed by a drunk driver in a head-on collision. He died instantly. I
couldn't even bring myself to go to his funeral. My agony was so great I
just couldn't come face to face with him that one last time. My failure to
attend intensified my parents' resentment for me even more. But from that
moment on, nothing seemed to matter, especially that living hell called
'home'. For one year after his death I roamed the streets in a fog barely
conscious of anything or anyone. I discovered alcohol, and girls, drugs
and in general a life I had never known which was exciting, frightening
and wonderfully dangerous. And it was then as I staggered through a down
town city street in one of my drunken rages I stumbled across a small
music shop and in the window stood the instrument, the fiery tool that
would become the object of my new found desire. The instrument of my
passion, my obsession, the blood-red six string. It was like I'd known
the thing all my life.

I soon found it was the only way I could truly express myself. It was a
way to vent all my frustrations and all my pain - completely opened all my
Four Doors Of Doom and I found myself going to the mirror for counsel less
and less. Because of this my songs seemed to write themselves and I knew
my destiny was in my music but I was going to have to get out of this
backwards town I was in if I was ever going to succeed. I was 16 going
nowhere and the only thing my parents knew was 'live, work, die. ' And if I
stayed there that was exactly what was going to happen to me - I was gonna
die. So I ran away to the big city with the lights, excitement and danger
and a chance for me to finally live and do my music without the
persecution I had known for so long. I hitchhiked all the way with a
suitcase in one hand and my guitar in the other and as I stood at the edge
of the city the magic of the place was incredibly intense. It was to be my
new home the place I would call the 'Arena Of Pleasure'. I lived and
struggled in the arena for two years trying to get a break in music and
make a record and that's when I ran across a delightful business man named
Charlie. He had been a lawyer for 25 years before he discovered he could
fuck over more people in the recording industry then he ever could in a
court of law and he was the president of one of the biggest record
companies in the world. The music business to Charlie was nothing more
than a sacrificial lamb to be led to slaughter and the weapon of choice
was his record company that he'd wield like a mighty sword. The great tool
he would lovingly refer to as 'The Chainsaw'. The morgue, Charlie said,
was the music business where everyone sells out. Where all the artists
will eventually whore themselves to commercialism, the place where the
music comes to die. And through him I learned everything I needed to know
about the music business and even things I didn't want to know. He said he
could make me a star, one of the biggest things the world had ever seen.
The big time was calling and I was on my way. He introduced me to an
aspiring young manager named Alex Rodman and together we took on the whole
fucking world and kicked it square in the ass.

Just before the release of my first album I was sitting on the steps in
front of my apartment when a gypsy woman passed by. She stopped and asked
me if I would like my fortune read and I had never had it done so I was
more than happy to say yes. She revealed a deck of Tarot cards and began
to tell me of my past in which she went into great detail about the pain
of my youth, my brother and my parents. She saw my present with my great
struggle to succeed and fulfillment of my dreams and new found happiness
but after about ten minutes she stopped and I wanted to know of my future
and pleaded for her to go on and finally she spoke. She showed me a very
disturbing vision of where I was going. I told her that I wanted a
phenomenal wealth and fame and in the cards she saw a fallen hero and
looked at me and said ""Be careful what you wish for - it might come true,
for the face of death wears the mask of the King of Mercy"". I asked her if
she was sure of what she had seen and with a blank stare she turned and",The Story of Jonathon (Prologue to the Crimson Idol) [*],1992

The crimson idol of a million eyes, of a million

I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed
The idol of a million, lonely faces look at me
Behind the mask of sorrow, four doors of doom behind my eyes
I've got their footprints all across my crimson mind

Long live, long live
Long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live

There is no love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free

I was the warrior with an anthem in my soul
The idol of eight thousand, lonely days of rage ago
And remember me when it comes your time to choose
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true

Long live, long live
Long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live

There is no love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free

Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?
The straps on my back
Red, crimson red, no, I was never to be
Only one crimson son, no, it never was me

Living in the limelight, little did I know
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed
But the dream became my nightmare, no one could hear me scream

With these six-strings, I make a noose
To take my life, it's time to choose
The headlines read of my demise, yeah, suicide, of my suicide

Oh, sweet silence, where is the sting?
I am no idol, no crimson king
I'm the impostor, the world has seen
My father was the idol, it was never me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, no, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes

No love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love, to shelter me, only love, love set me free

Desperate, a babe in teens

On borrowed beds of nails I wailed and I'd lose control
So shamelessly, so starved to be
Down this orphan's road

If time runs away tomorrow
There's nowhere left to hide
To the promised land, the roads I ran
But nowhere left to ride

And I'm running from the night, oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last rumaway tonight
The last runaway's alive, I'm coming home

And ransomed my soul
A broken boulevard of dreams, like misfits and their broken toys
A runaway, a slave in chains, I'd lose control
So painlessly, so hard to see
Down this beggar's road

If time runs away tomorrow
There's nowhere left to hide
To the promised land, the roads I ran
But nowhere left to ride

The last runaway tonight has come home
And I'm running from the night, oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last rumaway tonight, I'm coming home

Lay down my head, and hear no voices, my face so bold
Turned my back and feared redemption, like a thief I stole
Escape this place erase my shadow
Don't wanna lose my soul

I be peepin' the animosity, how these niggas be watchin' me
Ready to catch me slippin' so that they can cut the glock on me
Got's to be clever, when now they grindin' for your cheese

'Cause when it be comin to drama, my city's under siege
Watch who you're talkin to to, and keep your eyes on em
'Cause the closest nigga to ya is the nigga with wise on em
I rise on em, so now they label me a menace

And watch your enemies 'cause they creep on ya

I'd rather die with it on me then not have it all

Went from being fine as hell to look at my guest or roll

Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf

You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker

I hear police callin' my name, I ball in no lane

W.G. Snuffy Walden,"I've been cherishing,
Through the perishing
winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And maybe a stork will bring
This, that and t'other thing
to our room with a view.",Room With a View,2000
W.L.A.K.,"Oh Lord
Stone they all rejected
Still you did the unexpected
And stepped down from the throne
Oh Lord
Lower than the angels
No one else can save us
'Cause' you are God alone

I spend my days wondering where I belong
Any more these tears are memories
That are leaving me
I see a dim reflection in the mirror
And my lungs are filled with guilt
Effecting how I breathe
But time is diamonds
On the ring upon your finger
I've been married to this dream for so long
That I've forgotten what it means to remember
That I’m nothing on my own

Oh Lord

[Verse 2: Christon Gray]
I still don’t see the worth
That you see in me
But you would trade the world
Just to be with me
Now my hands are waiting
Just to touch your face
As the distance between us disappears
In the final hour I’m in search for the time
Just to capture this moment of forever
A thousand words later
The picture is worth so much more
And I know that I just can't explain myself

W.L.A.K.,"Heaven touched my mouth with a fire and made my heart pure
Now my heart pours for everything
From the gang violence in Chicago
To genocide in Darfur
To miscarried children, blood pours on the parched floor
Mama in abortion clinic, baby in a trashbag
All I do is tweet about it, lol hashtag
The new J's is coming out?
Oh I gotta grab that
But get that wisdom out my face and show me where the cash at
Then He placed a crown upon my head
Said that I'm a king already but not yet
Um what does that mean?
Nevermind just in me
I don't need to understand it, I just know that I'm free
Freedom from the Holy One
And no I'm not the only one

I tell ya what they focused on
The world around is dying everyday and we see it
The King's got the keys so he speak and he frees it, Jesus

Can you see its all in vain (all in vain)
And it breaks my heart to see you fall away (fall away)

We've been battling ourselves like forever, dog fight
Jackals with their tails tied together
All types of Christian churches and world views
But what about the church that the world views?
They see a perilous voyage into the Dead Sea for some pearl-less oysters
In other words it's pointless
They don't understand that this ain't nothing to toy with
They don't understand why we don't give up and join 'em
They don't understand how some of us were appointed
Some of us, cuz some of us are dealing with the sum of us
Not as equal as some say, son
I can see through the sun shades
Darling, you look devilish on the runway
I tried to tell 'em, they eyes would well up
But they some modern day Hellen Kellers
Only go by what they feel, Lord help us

[Chorus]

Yeaaa, breaks my heart
To see us focusing on things that will pass away
Clever distractions

This illusion is tragic
We focused on amusing the masses
But can't see that the center of attraction is all in vain like blind heroin addicts, its all a dream
Unwise settle for hat tricks
My heart cries when airs pulling out rabbits from they might 
As white lies turn to black magic
And destruction results from distraction
Did the folk of the cloth trade mirrors and smoke for the cross?
If so we hope its lost
The hocus pocus that we know that's in the culture will fall
If our eyes ain't on the King then our focus is off, its in vain

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

It's like everybody mind is in the same old state, ya know
I'll throw a nigga fucked up with his revenues
I'ma tell you four fuckin' things I'ma never do

(One)
Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two)
Never turn my back on my city
(Three)
Never let the money fuck with me

From the 3 to the 17, ey yo, we doin' it big
If you're ghetto you know who Wacko and Juvenile is
New Orleans, see I'ma rep that, 'cause these my peeps
You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets
Have you talkin' to this and that nigga and showin' your teeth
Walkin' 'round you like you took care and you handled your beef
Pissed off 'cause your hoe wanna come talk to me

To show me the little gift that she done bought for me
I take it back to when the big timers was pushin' the size
When niggaz wore Dickies suits like it was regular jobs
We cop Adidas, ghost town and Anita's used to be packed
And rumors started poppin' and it started to crack
We used to drink Crazy Horse and shoot dice in the back
We had four rules in life and I can promise you that

(One)
Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two)
Never turn my back on my city
(Three)
Never let the money fuck with me

Now why you muggin' a nigga? Let that bitch go
Let her bounce with a gangsta out six coat
Let her wil' out and flick it off a disco
Let me gas up, dick her down and get ghost
Ain't trickin' for the vagina, I like to get throat
Yo' stupid ass tryin' to stay in here and lick toes
Good girls love G's, that's how the shit go
That's why niggaz need to tighten up and get low

I know you heard of, I'm gettin' doe
Let me check my palm pilot, I'm gettin' hoes
Let me check my squad' wallets, we gettin' close
My squad up in the crowd wilin', they spittin' more
Drive by in the '5-5, forget a '4
Five, five and another five, we get a show
Fifteen and another five, you'll get some blow
You hustlin' your block, pop and you get some more

(One)
Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two)
Never turn my back on my city

Never let the money fuck with me

They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin'
They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin'

This is the year of the you, watch how I get on track
A young black Peyton manning in the rap gettin' his snaps
And also, he only rides in the year that he's in
'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so, let the boy be

He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
Bitches watchin' him thinkin', ""What if he wife me?""
And it's a certain kind of swagger you get
Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right

All of my boss bitches know the type
When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike
A nice fit and video on the TV'll
Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me

I'm a thug and I'ma stay on pub
And I don't hug 'cause I carry the strap in the club
I see ya peepin' tryin' to figure out what's happenin' with us
They love the way I be leanin', that's why they baggin' it up

You know that purple drank I be leanin', my diamonds shinin' and gleamin'
I'm in that dropper with Juve the groupies boppin' and fiendin'
I'm from the home of the candy paint, 84's and purple drank
Ladies know when I hit they corner my slabs'll make 'em faint

Ice Age and U.T.P., ball-ballin' as you can see
Crawl-crawlin' on 23's, with candy on my HumVee
Honies love the way I talk, love the way I walk
Love the way I lean, they say that I'm so clean

I got a lot of money, I got a lot of ice
I got a lot of cars, many colors and lots of types
I got that paper 'cause I'm caked up like Betty Crocker
Comin' down on choppers single file with all the trunk poppers

Gettin' money's my only task, stack up paper and count cash
I'm ridin' on that pull over silver, the same color as a bad rash
Gettin' full of that puff, puff, pass, it's Paul Wall, man, what that do
Swishahouse baby, that's my crew, comin' down jammin' on the Screw

Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin'

Drove over two dogs, sittin' on two fogs
My rims be talkin' too, they love to seduce hogs
They're dressed in cute clothes, manicured with cute toes
I'm big paper; Wacko never stop for group hoes

Oh no, I don't scoop those, fly bitches salute those
Fatties with benefits, you know I recruit those
This a Soulja Slim T-shirt, this ain't no suit hoe
I got Pradas up under these, not no Timberland boots hoe

I'm sick dog and there ain't no antidote
Bust your motherfuckin' head like a cantaloupe
Like Hannibal, woof, I'm an animal
Just cold dickin' the money down, huh, ain't it though?

I'ma do my damn thing 'til I can't no mo'
Don't make me pull this damn trigger 'til it ain't no mo'
And don't tell me where you ain't gon' go

Ho! It's young 'Face, slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind non-stop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gang-bang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of niggas bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see

Smoking weed with my homies, barbecue them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a mad Dom 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one hoe, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the Lincoln
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna' take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost

When I was 21 I had a yellow ferrari
22 I was Porschin' with the top let aback
23 with the Rolls with the pipe to match
24 wasn't trippin' on what I came up in 
I was focusin' how to be like j's back then
Money power and respect was the life I choose
Being famous wasn't nothin' I just like my doe
I was livin' in the fast lane mayne fo' sho'
Sure tip but quick up and let this thang unload
So if I had a problem with you, you the blame you know
Send a message and then this niggas brains explode
So if you see a nigga holla at me passin' by
Show up the deuce when I be leave and don't be askin' why

Part history, part sage, part mesquit,
He was there when Poncho Villa was young.

When the country was wild all around, 
Sit out under the stars of the Milky Way, 
And listen while the coyotes howl. 

And they go... hoo yip hoo yip hoo

And the outlaws are gone, 
Geronimo is gone, 
And Sam Bass is gone,
And the lion is gone, 
And the red wolf is gone. 

Well he cursed all the roads and the oil men,
And he cursed the automobile, 
Said this is no place for an hombre like I am, 
In this new world of asphalt and steel. 

Then he'd look off some place in the distance, 
At something only he could see, 
He'd say all that's left now of the old days, 
Those damned old coyotes and me. 

And they go hoo yip hoo yip hoo

Waddie Mitchell,"When I was but a young man, wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
It grieved them so to think their only boy was bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful livin' will lead only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my master call

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther' started blowin' and lightnin' flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, thought I heard a shout

At that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew a heard a voice, a voice so sweet and plain
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name

So frightened, I was thinking of the sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle, they stampeded and were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and threw me to the ground

I felt the end was nearing, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
Then I cried, ""oh Lord, forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for You alone, God these words I vow""

My wicked life unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me, and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life was His to take or give

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade 'least six or seven high
And right behind it, there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy, kneeling there upon the ground

A pardon I was granted and my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name",The Master's Call,1994
Waddie Mitchell,"Up before the sunrise
It's a rocky road back home
The dust won't be near settled
As where we just come from

I'll keep my promise to you
Just like I said I would
And lay you 'neath the pecan trees
And hang your spurs for good

Say goodbye to Montana
Where the northers always blow
The paint brush will be blummin'
By the time I get you home

We drove a herd from Texas
To the big Montana sky
I swear sometimes I wondered
If we make it here alive

I wish I could of told you
That you were my best friend
I guess you always knew that
But we were both to tough to bend

Say goodbye to Montana
Where the northers always blow
The paint brush will be blummin'
By the time I get you home

All honor to the cowboy
Your praises, they will sing
Cause you never sold your saddle
And that's the most important thing

We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened our pathways awhile

CHORUS:
Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

I've been thinking a long time, my darling
Of the sweet words you never would say
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish
For they say you are gong away

Do you think of the valley you're leaving
O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

CHORUS
They will bury me where you have wandered
Near the hills where the daffodils grow
When you're gone from the Red River Valley
For I can't live without you I know

CHORUS",Red River Valley,1998
Waddie Mitchell,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

 This joint's dedicated to all emcees 
 Yo, stay focused with this 
 A'ight 
 Stay strong, stay dedicated 
 Maestro 
 Check it out, yo 

 Yeah yeah, yo 
 I'm still smashin' it 
 So compassionate 
 House of Commons want me on the cabinet 
 The graduate who got the phattest shit 
 I splatter shit 
 Niggas better scatter when I'm splashin' it 
 Flashin' it 
 Pass the record books and watch me shatter shit 
 I made the city hot 
 Rhymes makin' niggas drop 
 Even free-stylin' when CKLN was fifty watts 
 Then I built the strategy 
 Gradualy, I planned to be 
 The greatest from the city 
 Brothers started stabbin' me 
 Made your backbone slide to this, glide to this 
 Brothers jealous 'cause their sons couldn't shine like this 
 It ain't my fault that my song's phat 
 It ain't my fault that my pops loved my mom, black 
 I made the bomb track 
 Kids were jackin' for beats when my rap hit the streets 
 I went to church and even signed my autograph for the priest 
 When my track was released, you noticed me 
 Toronto prodigy of poetry 
 Even white chicks were faintin' over me 
 The flyer boss, toured like Diana Ross 
 It kills me when I see you young brothers tryin' to floss 
 You got a long way to go to keep the hip in the hop 
 I left in ninety two, it's like the fukin' industry stopped 
 But it's on, don't panic 
 Emcees stay frantic 
 It's automatic, we makin' audio dramatic 
 Lyrically I'm a bill, at the top of a hill 
 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still

 We're gonna make it shine 
 We're gonna make it happen 
 It's a race against our time 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 We're gonna make it happen 

 [Maestro] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I remember when my pops took me to this lady 
 She said she couldn't believe how many shady people want to slay me 
 She said they want to wreck you, they want to wet you 
 But don't sweat it, your ancestors will protect you 
 Many nights I woke up, frozen stiff, couldn't move 
 Stayed calm, bible open on the twenty third song 
 Who could it be now 
 A brother that I ripped, an old school shorty that I used to hit 
 (go figure) 
 In life I learned cats'll try to hurt you 
 That's why I gotta stay tight with my family, and keep a small circle 
 Many broads said to me, that my seed they wanted to carry 
 Didn't love me at all 
 But to shine, they wanted to marry 
 Sayin' ""let's sex tonight"", but I'm a skeptic type 
 It's a rougher world 
 That's why it's tough to trust a girl 
 Never the less I'm maintainin', with pure determination 
 Two junos, plus ten nominations 
 No way I'm gonna crumble, I stayed humble 
 I reminisce when K-4CE teamed up with MC Rumble 
 T-dot, nineteen eighty six, turned the party out 
 Gave love, but didn't have to sweat the brothers down south 
 It's on, don't panic, emcees stay frantic

 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still

 That we're bound to make it 
 In time, we'll find 
 It's the sky of ?
 Oh oh oh

 We're gonna make it, We're gonna make it

 Yeah 
 You could never make the city smile 
 You're Conway Twitty style 
 Silly pile for real 
 You ain't a willy child 
 I cap your dome, everytime I rap alone 
 Plus the way I chaperons, make the feds tap a phone 
 I elevated you, you know who educated you 
 Peace to Ron Nelson, he put me on in eighty two 
 Now I'm comin' back 
 I got the stunning tracks 
 Spreadin' love to all my peeps and show the younger cats 
 Hit 'em with the phattest songs 
 Fuck the sprint, it's a marathon 
 I seen a lot of shit, now I'm passin' it on 
 I love Redman and Naughty shit 
 But now I'm on some Barry Gordy shit 
 I need another forty hit

Call up some old friends just to see if they're alright
I could read a book, Maybe something by Louis L'Amour
Oh but I don't feel like doing that at all
I could play guitar, maybe write a song
Something really inspirational that everybody could sing along
I could build a fire and watch it burn all night long
Oh but I don't feel like doing that at all
Cause I feel like loving you
I feel like holding you close
I feel like looking in your eyes
Baby you're the one I want most
Why can't I have you anymore
Why did you have to leave
Why can't I pick up and just move on
I could smoke a cigarette, maybe drink a beer
Turn on the radio, see if they're playing something I want to hear
Try to find me a woman
But everything just seems so hard
Cause I don't feel like doing anything at all

Did it feel like a hammer on your head
Waking up next to an uncold bottle of wine

I’m looking for longneck, regret explanation
Jim and Jack fallback reason that
I’m hungover

Ooh hungover, I ain't even had a drop to drink
Now I’m just kicking myself and wishin like hell
I could take back everything

Hungover, there ain’t a bottle or can in sight
Thinking the only thing left
Is I must’ve been getting drunk on my own damn pride

In things I can and cannot see

I’m gonna go
Down that deserted highway
I’m gonna go

Maybe I’m getting what I deserve
The guarantee was lost along the way

Quit giving up long ago

Where I learned to dream
And fell in love with something deep in me
That said this town just wasn’t big enough

Donut Shop
Where the old folks they still to go to talk
Well I wonder if I left a mark
And if they’d recognize me

Well I’m just a stranger in a strange town
Where the stars are the same and sun beats down
It was kind enough to give me all I need
I just hope I stay, long enough to be a memory

I started out
A thousand miles away from my childhood
Got a job and it payed pretty good
Fell in love with being free

Learned to live
On red wine and a broken heart
When that first love of mine fell apart
That’s when I found myself in need

Well I was a stranger in a strange town
Where the stars were the same and sun beats down
It was kind enough to give me all I need
And I just hope I stay, long enough to be a memory

Well halfway through three weeks out on the road
Where gypsy heart has a mind of its own
Just counting down the days ‘til it brings me back home
But tonight, yeah tonight

Tonight I’m just a stranger in a strange town

She hardly had a hand on the wheel
For changing the stations on that old radio
Dress fell off her shoulder
Just enough to see her dragonfly tattoo

But somehow she still walked out with cigarettes
Probably charmed them off that counter clerk
Just another man who would love to watch her drive
Ya watch her drive

Well I know come tomorrow
That she won’t be around
So maybe “Are we meant to be?”
Is no more than right, no more than right now

She cut the headlights off
Climbed up onto the hood
And we watched the trains roll by
And through a laugh she asked
Which one of those stars above do you believe is heaven?

I said I’m not quite sure
But I kinda feel with you girl I’m already there

The faces return in the night

Play your cards as they lay on the table

Was the one place I just couldn't go

Smell the rain comin' in on the wind

Said I can't burn it down
'Cause I'm gettin' up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sittin' at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hittin' on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy

Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money

Did I crash a party
Have a run in with the law
Take a swim in a fountain
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

There's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants

Who the hell is Heather
And when were we together
'Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
A cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm

It's fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money

Did I call my momma
Try to break into the mall
Did I even pay the cabbie
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

I remember how it started
After that it's just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday
Am I suppose to be at work

It's fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny

Will the room stop spinning
Will I find my car
On my way back home right now
It's all fuzzy
(Fuzzy)

Oh it's fuzzy
(Fuzzy)
It's fuzzy
(Fuzzy)
Everything is fuzzy",Fuzzy,2016

My daddy played the honky tonks
Out on the county line
One night he took me with him
Through those swingin' doors
And I heard that country music
Saw that crowded dance floor
Dad made fifty dollars
And I stayed up 'til three
And I thought
This is the life for me

By the time I turned fourteen
I was pickin' lead guitar
Everyday I went to school
And at night I played the bars
Two or three years later
I noticed something strange

From the girls began to change
I knew right then and there
What I was gonna be

Well I tried to go to college 
Just to see if I was wrong
But that ain't the kind of knowledge
That helps you write a country song
I got my education on the wild side of life
Through a cloud of smoke so thick
That you could cut it with a knife
There was no doubt about it
As far as I could see

To leave the past behind, cause you stayed on my mind

So I came on back home, I hadn't changed a thing
And sat here all alone, missing you and wondering

Where do I go to start all over
From your memory
Where do I go to start all over
When in your arms is where I won't be

I'd take some things and leave, If the change of scenery
Would do me any good, Like I know it should
I'd still be missing you, What goods a different view
To a broken heart, We'd still be apart
Someday I'll find the answer, To this mystery
But tonight the same old question, Just keeps on haunting me

That just leaves me to blame
When I get a little sideways on a honky-tonk tear

Boots and tight blue jeans

That I don't understand

But I sure know I'm there

Well he barely leaves the ground
I've got just enough left to get dressed up
And head back to town

Won't get you anywhere""

With the caution lights flashin', in the passin', lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin', down the drain

No she wasn't showin' yet but she'd be by Christmas time
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine

Was faraway dreams, cities she'd never seen
How do I find that girl when she could be

Out there anywhere she just up and left
She didn't leave a forwarding address
Or a trail for my lonely heart to follow
Which one of those four winds should I go chasing
She could be in a million places I guess
Up north, down south, back east, out west

She could be up in the Windy City
Where the world spins a little bit faster
Or gettin' a tan down in Miami that might be where I'd catch her
Maybe back in Virginia, her cousin lives there
Out in Arizona, she'd fit in anywhere
It's anyone's guess where she came to rest
My one chance for happiness is

Out there anywhere she just up and left
She didn't leave a forwarding address
Or a trail for my lonely heart to follow
Which one of those four winds should I go chasing
She could be in a million places I guess
Up north, down south, back east, out west

I'm sitting here at a four-way intersection
Praying Lord won't you point me in the right direction
She could be

Out there anywhere she just up and left
She didn't leave a forwarding address

Wadud Ahmad,"Stand up, stretch for the stars
Get somebody else involved right next to ya
Y'all elected me to keep it so fresh for ya
Just cause I make it possible for the rest of ya
To just take it there come on and
Get your head ringin' from the sting of the snare
Spine tingle elevating every singular hair
All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
Where the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Chain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's submerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use than might than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom
For real

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

Flash light, red light, proceed ahead right
Straight into them headlights, you get your head right
Head right get a third strike, hit the turnpike
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Make you wanna holla 'bout it
It ain't no doubt about it
Every now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it
And I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count
Yo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance
The shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw
Raw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls
Some of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar
Heart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth
Raise up time to lift off
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board
My og, my homey who taught me deal
Said in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel
And that's real, I'm a take it there

C'mon take it there, let's take it there",Take It There,2006

Fuere cual fuera

It's not easy

When they tell the Story of the Blues ","The Story of the Blues, Pt. 1",2000
Wah!,".well that's my story and i'm sticking to that. So let's have another drink and let's talk about the blues. Blues is about dignity, it's about self-respect, and no matter what they take away from you - that's yours for keeps. I remember how it was, how every medium - T.V. and papers and radio and all those people were saying: 'you're on the scrap-heap, you're useless', and I remember how easy it was to start believing that. I remember how you'd hear people take it for granted that it was true - just 'cause someone with an ounce of power said so. And that's a problem now, too many oddballs, too many pocketbook psychologists and would-be philosophers with an axe to grind. But there's a solution, it's not easy, but it's a matter of coming to terms in your heart with situation you're in, a matter of choosing how things go for you and not having things forced upon you. There are plenty of forces against you, forcing you against your will, your ideals - you've got to hope for the best, and that's the best you can hope for - you've got to hope against hope... I remember something Sal Paradise said, he said: 'the city intellectuals of the world are debauched from the full body blood-of-the-land and are just rootless fools'. So listen, when the smile, the condescending pat-on-the-back comes and says: 'we're sorry, but you're nothing, you've got nothing for us and we've got nothing for you', you say: 'No', and say it loud: ""NO!"", and remember, people who talk about revolution and a class-struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love, and what is positive in the refusal and constraint...since people have a corpse in their mouth...""","Talkin' Blues (The Story of the Blues, Pt. 2)",2000

When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
(But I) But I couldn't stay away

So I claimed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Sent to Glasgow for repairs
'Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry up before it's too late
Because I don't want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is gettin' me down
You'll find my corpse draped over the rail

But I climbed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Yeah, I climbed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag 
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, but I'm too tired

Wais of the Ranjahz,"What you think you like me? you ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk
I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something

You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Face one up, to take over, the break's over
Nigga I'm the god MC, me, Jay Hovah
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you want to see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm resident evil, moving like ?

Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the mac at yea, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it

Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire
""Show me the money"" like clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman
Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

Yeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours

Buy her a [?] now maybe you can visit her
About to finish her, you fucking free her
I pick her up, switch her to a Benz from a Kia
And I don't need her, I put money before divas
That's how I'm rocking fur, somebody run tell PETA
Who cares? New Airs, [?] for the public
What I rap about I really got, look and judge it
I'm like the Jim Morrison without the chorus in
Type of cat to drink til I black, wake up and pour again
It's war again, Benz 550's what we touring in
If you gon' go then hit the [?] and pour it in

I'm pimping without the limp, what's the pasta without the shrimp?
What's the chopper without the inf, never pop up without my mink
It's waist lift, most y'all niggas is straight simps
And I don't deal with change unless it's gon' make sense
I'm finessing this great [?] and I ain't gotta drive it
A million in wardrobe and I ain't got a closet
And we flying private, first class even
Thirst cash season, first class heathens
I'm a violent pimp, I slap til my palm hurt
All you see is some blood, a track and a convert
A long hearse if you skimming of the top
I'm big pimping like Hov with women on the yacht
Ten linen on the [?], rims spinning on the drop
A hundred on the band, hand spinning on the watch
Clam dinners on the spot

Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather

Full length mink chinchilla collars
The game so cold cause we chasing our dollars
It's even colder, when there's diamonds on your shoulders
But Guess make is for guests, VS makers protect
All the bullshit I know I did you wrong
And I made you so cold, bitch, listen to this song
Roses used to move you, dinner use to groove you
Now you're so cold, only smile when you choose to
Ice bucket love refrigerator romance
You caught me smashing 2 hoes now I got no chance
You're so cold so frigid, answer me I'm saying you
Ain't forgiving and I'm screaming ""I'm pimpin""
Sipping hot tea, bitches thats not me
Burberry scarf tied over, the fly rover
I think I damaged her, I use to manage her
It didn't work out no it's over and my hearts colder

Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love
If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love, me

I'm addicted to it, shot of clear fluid
When it comes to these bitches baby I'm the truest
Get ready for it, listen to the chorus
Showing her off, her status like the average tourist
She's sophisticated tell my momma I made it
I got a bitch that's so cold when I smoke she hate it
She ain't into jewels, she into property
She's a classy bitch but ghetto when on top of me
She be wilding out, 40 ounce and hollering out
Talking in tongues told me fuck her while I load my gun
Necklace very heavy, wrist watch blue berry
Let's put our business on the table baby you scary
Nothing but square feet, mafia rules
Square niggas can't get near me without permission
Need a pass to kill a pimp and that's the code
I'm pass the blow, fast to go hard on a ho when she acting cold

Cold, cold

Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

Made it from the bottom

And all of my cars start with a push of a button

You can tell it I'm ballin'
