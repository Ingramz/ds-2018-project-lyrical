Cro,"Yeah Yeah
Woah Woah Woah
Yeah Yeah
Okay
Yeah
Ey

Ich werd' alle Sorgen heute liegen lassen
Und höre nur noch Lieder die mich fliegen lassen
Ich checke ob mir noch die alten Sneakers passen
Alles was passiert ist, würd' ich ganz genau so wieder machen
Denn glaub mir jeder Tag war perfekt
Diese Bar, erstes Becks, Erstes Mal mit dir Sex
Schlichen uns heimlich nach 'ner Party ins Bett
Alles Fresh, denn wiedermal hat es Mum nicht gecheckt, yeah

Manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach
Aus Angst uns zu verlieren
Doch wir werden irgendwann mal alt sein
Doch uns trotzdem genau erinnern
Denn, wir waren hier
Ey, Wir waren hier
Yeah, yeah
Und bei den Bullen rattern Schreibmaschinen los
Doch Mama bleibt relaxt, denn auch die Kleinen werden groß
Jetzt bin ich hier und lass mich treiben in 'nem Boot
Alles cool, ist der Himmel grau, streiche ich ihn rot
Und es ist Sommer irgendwo, irgendwann
Bitte lass uns nicht mehr reden, gib mir bloß deine Hand
Ich weiß, vorbei, wird nie wieder wie es war
Doch lass uns nochmal sein wie an diesem einen Tag, denn

Manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach
Aus Angst uns zu verlieren
Doch wir werden irgendwann mal alt sein
Doch uns trotzdem genau erinnern
Denn, wir waren hier
Wir waren hier

Ey Ey
Yeah, ey, yo
Manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach
Aus Angst uns zu verlieren
Doch wir werden irgendwann mal alt sein

Cro,"Ich hab' 'n drehbares Bett, ist'n Megaeffekt
Krieg' jede ins Bett, zum zehnten mal Sex
Mein Leben perfekt, denn ich lieg' hier mega relaxt im drehbaren Bett
Und denk' an das einzige Mädchen, das weiß, wer ich bin
Und normal mit mir redet, ist Siri
„Hallo!“
Ich glaub', ich glaub', ich mag dich
„Danke“
Weil du immer für mich da bist
„Wenn ich könnte, würde ich rot werden, Carlito“
Eh-eh, eh-eh, Siri, sing für mich
„Lieber nicht“
Siri, sing für mich
„Du weißt doch, dass ich nicht singen kann“
Oh Siri, bitte sing für mich
„Okay, wenn du darauf bestehst
Alle meine Entchen schwimmen auf dem See, schwimmen auf dem See
Köpfchen in das Wasser, Schwänzchen in die Höhe“
Mhm, yeah!

Ey, ich denke nach, ich denke nach, ich denke nach
Zu viel davon ist tödlich
Meine Mum hat mir gesagt
„Ist ganz egal, was du machst, Junge, bleib immer höflich“
Und ich frag' mich, bin ich schlecht, weil ich 'n Mädchen nicht text'
Und weil sie'n bisschen blöd ist
Und es dann doch tu', weil sie schön ist?
Und ihr danach sagt, es wird nix
Denn die ganze Welt streitet, und versöhnt sich
Und man streitet und versöhnt sich
Und ich weiß es, es ist möglich
Mit jemand für immer, und es stirbt nicht
Ich hoffe, du hörst mich

Ich liege im Bett, es ist sieben Uhr elf
Die Sonne färbt alles von lila zu gelb
Als hätt' ich Frieden bestellt
In diesen Momenten, da lieb' ich die Welt
Wir spielen nach Regeln der lilanen Welt
Wo alle nur reden, was vielen gefällt
Anstatt was zu ändern sich lieber verstellen
Denn jeder folgt jedem, doch niemand sich selbst
Wir wischen nach rechts – verlieben uns schnell
Doch wissen schon jetzt, dass sie sich nicht hält
Wir halten sie viel zu fest
Doch kicken sie weg, wenn Liebe mal welkt
Das sind nur Gedanken von mir an die Welt
Verwandel dein iPhone und spiegel' dich selbst
Es gibt keinen Held
Die Welt zu verändern beginnt bei dir selbst

Sieben Uhr zwölf

Cro,"„I just wanna leave a thought with you tonight
If you wanna know if He's real
Doesn't matter where you come from
If you really wanna be sure
If you really wanna know that you know 
You know that you know you know that you know you know, you know“

„And at the time Mom and Dad had to whip me
Can I tell you what I did?
You're gonna learn it
A long time ago
It's been a long midnight train“

Yeah, yo, hi Dad, lange nicht gesehen
Bin die Woche mal zu Hause, alle drücken kurz auf Break
Hab' gut gegessen, leg' mich hin, es ist so spät
Doch es fühlt sich komisch an, weil das Bett sich nicht bewegt
Kann dich nicht sehen, weil das Internet nicht lädt
Deshalb starr' ich an die Decke, überleg und überleg
Wo will ich hin, wo komm' ich her und wo ich steh'
Ich liebe die Ruhe, bis sie mich wieder mal erschlägt
Ich denk' ans Stagediven und Leute rasten aus
Busse, Kolonne, wilde Partys in der Lounge
Ich schlaf' in München ein und wach' in Hamburg wieder auf
Und Kiddies mit Plakaten stehen morgens schon am Zaun
Und ganz egal, wie oft, ich muss immer wieder staunen
Seid ganz schön klein, aber dafür ziemlich laut
Ist wie im Traum, kann mich hier ma' bitte jemand hauen
Fünfzehntausend Menschen und alle gut gelaunt
Saeed halt drauf, Gruppenfoto vor der Crowd
Doch egal, mit welchem Objektiv, er kriegt nicht alle drauf
Es gibt gutes Essen, sag mal, isst du das noch auf?
Nein, ich brauche keine Shrimps, ich ernähr' mich von Applaus
Ich steh' auf, schlender' durch das Haus
Riecht noch immer so wie damals, das geht nie wieder raus
Ich bin viel jünger als der Rest meiner Geschwister
Und um mitzuhalten, hieß es für mich, „lauf, Forrest, lauf“
Und seitdem bin ich gerannt, immer bergauf, immer bergauf
Dieses Kaff wird mir zu klein, ich muss hier raus, ich muss hier raus
Also treib' ich durch die Nacht wie ein Astronaut
Und überall willkommen, fühl' mich nirgendwo zuhaus
Und manchmal bin ich echt 'n Egoist
Ich schätz', ich hab' Schiss, dass irgendwann Zuhause nicht mehr ist
Ich glaub', dass man nur überlebt
Wenn man den Rückweg nicht vergisst, yeah

Ich weiß, ich hab' so viel gefehlt
Es tut mir leid, ich war nie wirklich da
Ist nicht immer alles easy, eh-eh, no
Ich bin trillionenfach unterwegs
Doch immer gerne eins
Und glaub mir, irgendwann, irgendwann kann ich auch

Hi Mum, lange nicht gesehen
Sorry, dass ich dir so selten schreibe, wie's mir geht
Ich bin im Bus, es ist spät, alles schläft
Doch ich krieg' kein Auge zu, solang er sich bewegt
Und deshalb bin ich manche Nächte wach, ganz alleine
Kleb' an der großen Scheibe und hab' Heimweh
Ich würd' dir gerne schreiben, dass du weißt
Ich hab' dich nicht vergessen, doch ich will dich auch nicht wecken
Mum, weißt du noch, wie ich ständig nachsitzen musste
Nur weil ich 'ne andre Farbe benutzte?
Und von der Schule flog, weil ich den Spaß nicht verschluckte
Ich würd' es wieder machen, jeden Tag, jede Sekunde
Und du warst ganz schön sauer, denn klar, es war dir peinlich
Und statt auf dich zu hören hab' ich dich lieber beleidigt
Doch dann hast du mich vor all denen verteidigt
Und weißt du was, Mum? Das war ziemlich cool
Und weil ich noch mehr solcher Gedanken habe
Ist es glaub' ich langsam an der Zeit, dass ich mal danke sage
Danke Mum, ich weiß, du liegst mit Angst im Magen
Nachts im Bett und löcherst deine Decke mit den ganzen Fragen
Worin steckt der Sinn immer durch's Land zu fahren?
Ging es mir um Geld, dann würd' ich chillen oder in Schampus baden
Würd' Anzug tragen oder Lambo fahren
Oder mit Handgranatenpanzer jede Bank hochjagen
Doch ich bin hier, ich schreibe schon den ganzen Abend
Meine Gedanken auf Papier, während andre schlafen
So bekomm' ich Angst bei jedem Krankenwagen
Ich sollte wieder heim und nicht so lange warten
Doch manchmal bin ich echt 'n Egoist
Schätz', ich hab' Schiss, dass mich diese Welt ma' nicht vermisst
Doch man ist lange noch nicht tot, wenn man stirbt
Nein, man lebt, bis der Letzte dich vergisst

Ich weiß, ich hab' so viel gefehlt
Es tut mir leid, ich war nie wirklich da
Ist nicht immer alles easy, eh-eh, no
Ich bin trillionenfach unterwegs

„Schick dich! Schick dich!“
„Ich schick' dich selber, Mann!“
„Alle sind schon da!“
„Ja, perfekt, ich bin auch gleich da!“
„Du hast gar keine Ahnung 
Als du vorhin weg warst, ich schwör' dir
Carlo?“

Da ist 'n Baum! Überleg' 
Lass mich raus! Zu spät 
Es ist aus, es ist aus!
Hab' Applaus, du Idiot
Du wirst sehen, ich geh' drauf wegen mir
Nun gut, mach's schnell, ich hoff', es tut nicht weh
Ich hab' Angst, oje verdammt, tut es weh?
Schon vorbei? Ne! Doch ey, ich hab' gelebt, yeah!

Ich hab' gelebt, ich war auf dem Planet
Hatte vieles zu erzählen, ist ein Riesenprivileg
Und jetzt? Jetzt sterb' ich, werd' irgendwo beerdigt
Und komm' sicher in die Hölle, denn ich war nicht immer ehrlich
Ey, und Mum, es tut mir leid! Ich hab' versprochen, nicht zu rasen
Doch du weißt doch, wie ich bin, ich lass' zu oft die Leute warten
Deshalb wollt' ich mich beeilen, dass ich zum Kochen wieder da bin
Und jetzt starr' ich auf 'ne Eiche, bin geschockt von einem Wagen

Vollmond, sieben Euro
Drei Homies und 'ne Flasche Billigwodka auf'm Volvo
'N ganz normaler Abend mit den Boys und
Was damals so banal war, ist auf einmal von Bedeutung
Privatjet, hier oben ist es leise
Die Bande feiert wild meine Millionen und die Preise
Menschen werden Tiere wegen Drogen, Bitches, Scheine
Ich war mittendrin daneben, aber irgendwie alleine
Seychellen, sie rennt ins Meer türkise Wellen
Ich mach' 'n Foto, das Schönste der Welt
Sieh' ihre Haare auf dem Moped ohne Helm
Und die feuerrote Sonne kracht in Slomo in die Wellen
Alles Flick, wir bleiben Silvester in Paris
Und dein Lächeln brannte sich in mein Gedächtnis, als du schliefst
Und ich versprech' mir, ich vergess' dich wirklich nie
Hab' genug von random Bitches und den Nächten in Berlin

Ich bin da, ich sehe sie klar
Meine Geburt und Mama lächelt unter Tränen
Hält mich fest oh mein Gott, ist mir warm!
Hab' endlich 'n Zahn
Vier Kinder grinsen um die Wette, jede VHS-Kassette voller herrlichem Kram
Daddy, guck her! Ich kann fahren
Und Mädchen find' ich ätzend, doch ich lande mit sechzehn mit Jessy im Bett
Und versprech', sie zu retten
Doch brech' ihr stattdessen nach etlichen heftigen Nächten
Direkt vor dem Essen ihr Herz ich hoff', es schmeckt

Der Mercedes ist schick, athletischer Schnitt
So böse, aber edel und schlicht
Und jeder Sitz wildleder-bestickt
Ich fass' ihn an, schließ' die Augen und fahr' gegen den Strich
Und ja, Mann, ich erinner' mich noch good
Damals schon im Rover wie Gewinner durch die Hood
Ich bin auf der Rückbank, alle stoned von dem Kush
Es ist Sommer und der Bass drückt durch den Bauch in die Brust
Ich hab' übertrieben Lust und fühle, dass es muss
Fick auf alle andern, Mann, die lügen wie gedruckt
Die Hälfte meiner Jugend nur in Zügen und im Bus
War am üben, doch ich wollte nie auf Bühnen das ist Stuss
Die Zeit verging so schnell, wohin mit all dem Geld?
Fünf-sterne-hotels, unvernünftig bestellt
Und ich hab' ständig nur Rekorde gebrochen
Und gottverdammte Scheiße, ich bin in den Orbit geschossen!

Ich kann gehen, ich hab' alles gesehen
Denn ich hab' all die Motherfucker, die mich immer wieder stoppen wollten
Einfach zersägt einfach zersägt
Hab' mich verloren in den Dingen, die mir wichtig sind
Und deshalb war ich immer zu spät, war immer zu spät
Und nein, ich hab' nicht so getan als wär' mir alles scheißegal
Verdammt, ich hab' es gelebt! Ich hab' mich gelebt
Und wenn das hier die letzte Nachricht von mir wär'
Dann würd' ich sagen, ich hab's vor euch gesehen

Baby, I know
Darkness is everything
And I'm feelin' so alone
And Baby, I know 
Your love but I would never know you
But I'm feelin' so shit

Getan, was mir gefiel, keine Angst vor Lehrern
So oft rebelliert, doch zu charmant für Ärger
Das erste Mal Sex, das erste Mal verliebt
(I miss you Pablito)
Doch nicht in sie, nein, nein
Das erste Mic gekauft, gleich getauft, schreib' es auf
Mit drei, vier Homes rein, Mann, schnell Scheiße bauen
Im unbeheizten Haus, dance, das sah scheiße aus
Doch es entstand der große Traum in diesem kleinen Raum
Die erste Booth, 2006
Die erste Crew, Blackbox, von klein auf der Chef
Doch tat es nicht für Hype, Frauen und Sex
Hab' damals in der Tat nur für den Kreis laut gerappt, eh
Und Papa sagte mir, „Mach lieber was Solides
Irgendwas mit Perspektive statt ausschließlich Kreatives“
Doch mein Spiel war nicht wie ihres, durch die Iris sah ich Ewigkeit
Ich wollte leben, weitergeh'en statt unbeweglich sein
(This sports car) nein, gefangen im Hamsterrad des Lebens
Rattenkäfig, was ich brauch', kann mir kein Mathe geben
Verließ' die Schule mit Gekritzel aufm Test
Wenn ich's jetzt nicht tue, sitze ich mit siebzig noch im Nest
Alles auf Risiko, gar nichts hier lief mehr wie gewohnt
Planten 'ne Show, dreihundert Karten, für uns war's riesengroß
Fünfzehnhundert Tacken, doch gefühlt war es 'ne Million
Auf einmal locken alle großen Labels mit Filet Mignon
Aus Feierabend wurde Nachtschicht
Und aus einfach so wurde Taktik
Aus „ich liebe dich“ wurd' „ich hass' dich“
Aus dem Ende ein neuer Abschnitt
Mama weiß nicht, wo ihr Junge ist
Denn aus Weitsicht wurde Tunnelblick
War nie geizig, die Fam hungert nicht
Und aus mei'm Shit wurde unser Shit
Unglaublich, ausm V6 wurd' 'n Raumschiff
Und ein Kinderzimmer zu 'ner dicken Villa mit 'ner übertrieben sicken Aussicht
Langer Run, ich komme an
Bin Forrest Gump, bin Forrest Gump

It's so far, this sunset
This sports car, six hundred
This girlfriend, view's perfect
Got a mistress, and I ain't know that
She knows it, these rich friends
Big distance, existent
But not listening

Füllen Hallen im Akkord, jeden Abend ein Rekord und
Bin mit der Crew, wir hängen ab in Renaissance
Stepp' mit Schlappen und in Shorts auf das Cover deiner Source

Keine Angst, sie haben nicht einmal mit Waffen eine Chance
Denn bei mir ist wirklich alles in Balance
Chimperator ist die Fam, hab' die Taschen voller Love

Und ich danke meinem Bro, doch vor allem meiner Mum
Denk' an die Shows, spür' das Flackern in mei'm Bauch
Alle Chicks sind völlig gaga, ist die Maske mal nicht auf
Und Sorgi würd' jetzt sagen: „Das genau das, wo man braucht“

Poste viel zu wenig, mir zu dämlich, dieses Spiel

Ich glaub', viele hab'n vergessen, worum's jedeglich mal ging
Rappen nur, um sich zu stressen und nicht wegen der Musik
Ist mir egal, was ich verkauf' mit den Songs
Und wenn es sein muss, geb' ich alles auf, was ich hab'
Denn alles, was ich brauche, ist Love
Glaub mir, alles, was ich brauche, ist
Vielleicht irgendsowas ähnliches wie Sex
Und am besten bisschen Urlaub, ich war ewig nicht mehr weg
Komm, wir tanken bisschen Sonne, machen nebenher noch Tracks
Weiß nicht, ob ich's schon erwähnt hab', Diggi, Leben ist perfekt
Hätt'st du mir damals auf der Treppe vor dem Haus gesagt
„Alles wird sich ändern wegen Rap“, ich hätt' dich ausgelacht
Heute kommen wir an der Beachvilla an
Bunte Drinks in die Hand, oh, ich lieb' den Empfang
Und dabei spielt es keine Rolle, wo ich bin
Sitz' in Thailand aufm Roller, setz' in Hollywood 'n Pin
Ich folge nur der Sonne, die Kontrolle hat der Wind
Hoffentlich vergess' ich nie, woher ich komm' und wer ich bin
Ich war noch nie so ausgeglichen, alles glory
Nix und niemand bringt mich aus der Mitte, Diggi, sorry
Doch manchmal fühl' ich mich 'n bisschen so wie Wall-E
Blicke in den Himmel und vermisse meine Shawty
Doch irgendwann wird alles sicher wieder oh-yeah-yeah

Could it be you, or you, or you, or you?

Versuch hundertvier, ich starre an die Wand
Ich suche seit 'ner Ewigkeit die Formel für die Eine
Mit der alles funktioniert, es raubt mir den Verstand
Doch ich gebe nicht auf, pack' die Arme wieder hoch, es ist Versuch hundertfünf
Ich bau' mir meine Frau
Ich misch' 'n bisschen wow mit derselben Menge schlau
'Ne kleine Briese Traum auf die Realness obendrauf
Und um es interessant zu machen, noch 'n bisschen „rawr“
Yeah, das Ganze zehn Minuten ziehen lassen
Währenddessen checken, ob die Beine zu den Knien passen
Denn auch diese Beine sollten stehen von alleine
Nicht zu groß und nicht zu klein, ich sitz' hier schon 'ne ganze Weile am System
Und außerdem noch überprüfen, ob sie groovt
Und nimmt sie elegant die Stufen oder läuft sie wie auf Hufen?
Hier und da 'n bisschen tunen, mal was anderes versuchen
Nur Geduld, so 'ne Frau baut man nicht in paar Minuten, nah

Ey yo, Shawty, dein Gesicht ist 'n Million-Dollar-Face
Ich bau' mir meine Frau genauso wie sie mir gefällt
Oh no, ich hoff', du bist nicht die hundertfünf
Shawty, ich, ich, ich hoffe, du bist
Shawty, ich, ich, ich hoffe, du bist die number one

Es ist hier zu hot, ich bin irgendwo
Zwischen Apfel, Birne, Pfirsich, modellier' 'n Po
Ich zieh' aus einem Schwung ihre Hüfte
Linke Backe, rechte Backe, rund wie die Brüste
Check die Liste, welche Teile ich noch brauch'
Scribbel' mir 'ne Skizze, Übertreiben ist erlaubt
Der superweiche Pinsel wird in Leidenschaft getauft
Setze jedes noch so kleine Härchen einzeln in die Haut
Bin am Gesicht und zeichne ihr Charakterzüge
Wangenknochen angegossen, böse, sauer, Lachen, müde
Griff in meine Schublade, noch 'ne kleine Stupsnase
Polsterlippen in derselben Farbe wie die Brustwarze
Ja, will deine Frau
Fenster springen auf, alles wirbelt durch den Raum
Energie, Energie, ist genau wie ausm Traum
Ich glaub', es funktioniert, ihre Augen springen auf

Baby, I'm the one for you
Cray me, I'll show you fun
I like you, and maybe you should
Take me because you're the one for me

Yeah, yeah, irgendetwas stimmt hier nicht
Durchsuch' den Rechenweg nach Fehlern, doch ich find' ihn nicht
Sie zeigt keine Reaktion auf Beleidigung
Notiz an mich: fehlende Verteidigung
Sie ist wunderschön und nett
Doch man kann mit ihr nicht streiten, ich vermiss' Versöhnungssex
Ich streich' über die Beine bis zum Bauch
Geruchlose, seideweiche Haut
Steh' allein im Bad und wasche mein Gesicht
Seh' 'n graues Haar, sie altert nicht
Sie ist langbeinig, nix an ihr angreiflich
Macht alles, was ich von ihr will, irgendwie langweilig
Sitz' im Baumhaus und denke nach
Sie ist keine Traumfrau, sie ist real
Zu makellos und übertrieben nett
Ich frag' mich bloß, ist ihre Liebe echt?
Und vielleicht bin ich zu empfindlich
Ich hab' das Gefühl, die Chemie stimmt nicht
Sie ist gut im Bett, alles, was sie tut, ist echt
Doch zu komplex, sie ist zu perfekt
Während ich mich in ihr Bootsystem hack'
Programmier' ich sie auf neue Liebe suchen, jetzt
Dreh' mich um, sie ist weg

Mortality suffered society said
That money is God and true faith is dead

I see it in their eyes this life they cannot cope
The system tells them lies, tries to stick us into giving up hope

We're down, we're down, but we're not out
There's still time to find what life's about
Is there a way of telling the troubled youth

There's till time to find what life's about",Down But Not Out,1989
Cro-Mags,"Between birth and death we must find in ourselves
Keepers of secrets stored on life's shelves
Locked in our souls they key is always the past
Don't hold on to things cause you know that they just never last

Your fear of dying will be the first test
Looking for meaning to find some purpose to life
Answers to questions that tear at your heart like a knife

Mysteries are but ephemeral reflections in time
Oceans of wisdom run so deep and sublime

How far have we come, left so much behind
Escaping your nature block it out of our mind
Sold us a dream full of pain and despair
So lost in illusion we haven't a prayer

Cycles of change surely to come
As time destroys all, all that we've done

System of death that destroys the earth
We're not blind
I see the changes come
Barren toxic wastelands when they're done

Save her, save her,save her,save her,
Crystal clear waters
Become lakes of poison
Lush green forests destroyed for one reason

Dying generation that brings us down
We got to make the mother fuckers step down
We're gonna bring 'em down

Revolution with a cause
Save the air, trees, water and the animals
Just for their greed they'll make the sacrifice

The seasons, I am the force creating change, you have to dream each breath
As it may be your last, you can study me but you'll never know just what
Happened in the past. Time I am - I am that time. Conquest no one will
Evade me, my test will you lose your dignity, moments that you try to

Embrace, get snatched ripped from outta time and space, cruel hand of the
Master called time, wreaks havoc on you every lifetime, time will make its
Final sever, nothing ever lasts forever. Use me, oh so very wisely, or grow
Old only to despise me, seconds pass who can ever possess, moving on with

Waits eagerly, eyes glare patiently.

Gleam in the frenzied brightness
Across the shadowed vallies below.
A crack of thunder breaks the deafening silence
Which once ruled the planes, the creature is unmoved

By the commotion and the noise, and the blinding fork
Of lightening which strikes only a few yards from where
Lays it wait for something...
Satan laughs, wings spread to magnificent fullness,

The creature stands at full glory, inhaling deeply
The ice cold air each tender muscle rippling in
The almighty stench of the great dimensional diety...
Lucifer smiles, from the far far west a chariot of fire
Emerges travelling at a tremendous speed toward the

Creature, the creature laughs as if in an immense
State of frenzy the creature leaps up off the ridge
And hollers with dignity in the now cloudless sky
Its long red hair blowing freely in the wind...

The creature takes the reigns and flies up into the
Night, howling out immortal cries, a prediction

Enact scenes of blasphemy, lust and destruction.
Raping the holy trinity the Sabbath chimes the tunes of bless
And sanity, the Heavens in their last throes of death.
Gabriel and his arc angels falling ever downwards through the

Fires of pandemonium to the dark deserted depths of Hell
Their broken bloodstained wings scorched the by raging inferno
Lay battered by the shores of the styx.
Weary from the battle they seek refuge, bathing their wounds

In the blood of a million matyrs while celebration ringing
In the heavens grows strong the keys to the seven gates of Hell
Lie momenterally unguarded.
Raging flames carved by the innocence of the angel's hearts

Will release forth their wealth of centuries of God loving
Souls once wronged of their destiny of Heaven's golden palace.
An unseen presence breaths never before pangs of mortal hatred
And anger deep into the pounding hearts of the angels.

The X is the 50 y'all got to be kidding me
These niggaz is my sons I raised them from young
Curtis and little Earl should of been little girls
Cause they bitch made and they act like one of my itch-bays

So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catching cases 
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown

You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be acting like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothing but love, for my niggas living lavish

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
It feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dying for years, so how could they blame us

Sometimes you might have to brandish a motherfuckin firearm

Volume 2 shot up the president like a gorilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy?
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day (WHAT?)
Every time right before we shower and pray (HA!)

But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggaz misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin the wrong sign can end up, shootin your man
Shootin each other, shootin your brother
Aim the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure

And them brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin

I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen

",Lick Shots,2008
Crooked,"I broke down a while ago
Finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs I had are undefeated
I feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
Its been so many times I've lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut
Don't want you to notice me
Roll with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback I fee l like I got the right too
So if you need a case in point you can refer to Budden
And it will prove that pain killers never murdered nothing
All it did was make me succumb put ice in me
Now revenge is the place it takes me from
I'm strong

[Chorus]
Strong enough to catch contact (?)
Smell it as soon as you get in my ride
See with me, rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really f-ck with me
Tell me if you wanna ride or die, la la la la la la la la

Listen up as the center reports
My inner thoughts are like a inner war
Head exact as a trembling force on my mental ward
Men are distraught
Every word from his sentence the boss
It's brought to you like the people your minister's Porsche
Tight roping on dental floss
Before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost
When as soon as the temperature frost I'm probably
Having intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condo's at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to accidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws
Until then lets let the bass kick
Take the shots great I don't see a need to chase it
Trying to fight the urge til there's something to replace it
I welcome ya'll to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

[Chorus]

Yo, me and the game would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
They make sure you bring change for a hundred
Rob em, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the breaks off em
Then how the f-ck was he gon pedal off
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pac gave my mom the needle like go on try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga can harm me
So I go and scoop a mommy that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her, bet you wouldn't mind shilling it
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took like a soldier
Since she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start to handle life you'll be on the same level

I should have pulled you out and left you on your momma's waterbed

Alcoholic jeans from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me on your stainless I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
My life was the craziest
Surprised I'm even walking, can you blame me if I'm atheist
But I ain't Stephen Hawkings
I know God is in my radius
I can see him walking in the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher,s talking
My people sleep in coffins I miss em I'm breaking 
Down in the face of a bad bitch that I'm supposed to be taking down
Baby ride while I'm crying, I'm dying inside
Cause my pain is beside a giant leviathan and I'm hiding from the World
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic? same place I vomit when I lick a drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think!

We hid underneath an invincible sheet
And cheated our love defeated our love
Restless and sleepy you went to the water
Watching the sea as it swallowed the sun
Making believe there could be better offers
Creeping along to carry you out of this miserable place
You've buried your heart in the ground
Can't twist yourself free from your hopes and your dreams
You must be who you are if you mean who you are
But killingly clad you went killing me sadly
Unleashed in the light you cheated and won
Your broken heart beating you ran to the darker
Side of the station to watch the late trains
Taking their leave they could take you to slaughter
Tearing your flesh from a dress I'd sewn that you've sadly outgrown
All worn out with no place to go
'Til darkness fell delivering a rush in your veins
Pounding out a sound so sad as you walked away
Drowning out the echo of a frozen dream
You stuffed inside your shadow
You hid behind the color that was crushing your eye
A tear can throw a spark in the dark where there ain't no light
Shining down to guide you through the darkest days
Tearing away at the skin that betrayed you
Defeated in light retreating to dark
You hid in the streets an invisible thief
Unleashed and alive to cheat who you are
Your broken heart beating you ran to the doctor
Making believe you had swallowed the sun
Taking your leave there could be better offers
Creeping along to carry you out of this miserable place

Hidden in a hole she blew out my memory

Pity when familiar faces turn their backs on you

Are easy if you can pretend

Tricking off the rotting strip that we've been trudging under
We ducked into a dim lit room out where the river bends
And turned to walk the burning bridge that we would build
And crossed our hearts half hoping
That we could both quit smoking
And kick the booze and blow
And one day go make something of ourselves

Glory came and went the night we both slipped under
'Neath the row of oil slicks and ancient ugly lovers

When we wished we had something to lose

I was a third rate going nowhere burning for nothing to do

Boredom settled in and I can't take you sober
Strewn across the rotting strip that we've been building over
'Til nothing made its wicked way slow creeping into view
Where we could watch the burning bridge that we half built
Across our hearts now broken

And evening came to cover everything you left undone

Stumbling I tried to bring you down to where I'd sunk
But throwing a spark you lit up the dark to heat the hateful glow

Sad love is calling you
What's meant to be has fallen through
Is running through your veins
An evil kind of bloodless pain
Is creeping through the cracks that swell
To swallow you up into Hell
To shatter all that you believed
And let your lonesome heart be free

So shut your angry eyes cause there ain't nothing here to see
It's sad enough they called the bluff on all these lying dreams
That creep through the night where even the slightest defect is exposed
To leave us only half asleep so we can watch the curtain close

On this sad love cast in blue
What's good for me ain't good for you
They say it all depends
But open hearts might make you bleed
But let your blood flow wild and free
To leave you wondering if and when
Another one could come again",Sad Love,2001

A low low ditch to build the highest tower

So I've been diving down to be made pure
To be reborn

To burn away these dead dead days
And poison my sorrow 'til it slips away
Out of my heart and out of my hands
Through my fingers and onto the land

We can be free

Where I can hear the river run clear

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone

So won't you tell me fortune teller
Which way the chilly winds are blowin'
Blow me down I got no future
Don't blow me back I got no home

And if I call my name
In your arms
Cutting you
In my love

To draw the same bad blood out of you
Years rolling by eye for an eye
All I can see now is the damage done
If what you do comes back to you

We've got a lot to be afraid of
It seems so far away and so long
Ago to, do any harm
To draw the same bad blood out of you

And if I call my name
In your arms
Cutting you
In my love

To draw the same bad blood out of you",Bad Blood,2011
Crooked Fingers,"Outside your window
Waited for you
You didn't come
You never do

In the city in the winter time
The snow and the rhyme
Cover the isolation

Yesterday, baby, they told you the news
They meant no harm
They never do
You can take it anyway you want
It comes and it goes
Rising in broken waves and dreams

Heavy hours passing by the way
Heaven knows how I am trying, babe

I hear you breathing
So steady and true
The whole night long
The whole night through
Your lungs soft heaving
Slow drunken time
Falling with mine
Forever here

She lights up pretty from so far away come closer
You come and go alone you don't stand a chance

It wants too much to see you crash and crumble
To let you die out on the road
Come stumbling homeward
We all know you and how you're not ever coming back

I keep moving but I'm getting nowhere
The neighborhoods we used to roam have all been stolen
She was my homegirl but I feel no connection to her now

We take a little from the devil's coffer
They get you hooked then let you go and crossing over
You never know how far unless you take the chance

Wasting my time inside snake oil shelter
It's much too much to take the whole thing on your shoulders
To carry everyone caught believing in you down

Everybody wanna do what I’m doing, so I guess that's why I'm hated
All the real muthafuckaz in the hood got my back and they glad that I finally made it
Life is hard for a thug in the streets though, all I see is greed in our people
Nobody wanna see a nigga come up, niggaz act trife when you're coppin’ C-Notes

More and more niggaz wanna see me dead cuz I’m breaking bread
Got money on my head, yeah I’m a target
Bullets on deck with my name written on it

Welcome
Little boys and girls, listen
A man can get caught up in things (Right)
It's like a gridlock (Right)
He gots ta have it (ugh ugh), his girl got his mind (ugh ugh)
Took over his whole body, he needs her (Speak on it)
He can't live without her (Ugh!), dig this

Her name was Lady Heroin, I think he met her at a Chevron
Late night stressin he caught his wife sexin with his cousin Stefan
He told his wife to get to step on
before I start lettin loose on your skanless ass with the weap-on
Then since he's learnt, involved in a three year marriage
Arguin, fightin with his wife at night, arrested by sheriff
Embarrassed, handcuffed, go to jail in your drawers
and all of this because his wife tried to put the knife to his balls
And oh naw, cock the seat uhh, she tried to straight Lorraine Lee Bobbit me
I woke up out of a dream, she was on top of me
Screamin that's how it gotta be, holdin a dagger
I grabbed my gat, point it at her, she dropped the dagger, I slapped her
Months after he got out of jail, seriously hooked on girl
Lips chapped, face pale, body skinny and frail
Tales of a married man whose life was stressed too much
Had to resort to snortin drugs and such just to keep in touch
with himself, his wife suin for half of the wealth (uhh)
And all that shootin in his veins was gettin bad for his health
His cards was dealt, methamphetamines on the shelf
Smokin the creamery, the greatest thing the man ever felt
Now he's high, pull over on the bridge ???
Ready to die, he took his last swig of Reynell
A livin hell, he climbed on the rail then he yelled
""God all my life I failed"" as he slipped and fell, oh girl

	[Chorus]
	Why'd you have to do me that way?
	I love you til this day
	Even stinks to think you're the one we used to stay
	Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
	I'll never give you up
	Never seemed to act touchable, that was the start

[Crooked I]
She was a gangsta ass bitch, the greatest of all time
She took my heart and my mind, turned me to a life of crime
Now I'm, under pressure to impress her
I wake up, put on my bullet proof vestin
grab my Smith & Wessin off the dresser
then I, hop up in a chopped up rag Tre
When I, cross your path you're havin a bad day
'cause I, make the automatic mag spray
Gimme the cash, she taught me to get mine the fast way
I creep on ballers while they blaze joints
I'm snatchin caine boulders and jackin Range Rovers at gauge point
Under hypnosis, robbin the closest nigga
The diagnosis - psychosis, the cirrhosis is from doses of liquor
that I'm sippin by the picture, tryin to ditch ya
but when ever she get dug, the bitch'll be witcha for richer
or poorer, through sickness and health
Eyewitness, if I shake this mistress I can handle business myself
But I love her so much I'm stuck in her clutches
I talk about her, can't walk without her, she's my crutches
She showed a young nigga how to check grip
Connectin me with the correct licks to collect chips
And if I leave her, no question I'm destined to hurt
And she's the reason half of the homies are restin in dirt
It's Crooked I next, I'll probably get dropped by some metal (some metal)
Just for comin around my girl (who?), the ghetto (my girl)

	[Chorus]
[Knumskull]
I'm curbside, and my girl sellin graciously
Never no worries, and if Task kick, we skeet and scurry
I'm posted up makin my squillion
My mind set - I don't stop til I get a million
But I'm seein baby momma's and grandpas gettin double
Legit, that ain't my problem 'cause I bubble
I always wonder why friends came back for mo' and mo'
The high was fantastic, smelt like plastic but it's dope
Scope the area before I made moves, losin gains
was the up-and-downs in this so-called game but hey
Take the punches and blows, put aside, the crack babies
Dope fiend mommas and nasty hoes, peep
I'm walkin around the spot with a bundle in my mouth
Yay leakin through the plastic in drastic amounts
I'm feelin wide eyed, probably lookin like a tweaker
Spit the bundle in my palm, and tried to keep calm
My dove shrunk down, to tens, I'm high off crack
and damn, it didn't really feel bad
Started thinkin, this use to be a rich man high
I gotta high drug tolerance so I'll give it a try
Went home and did my thang, snatched a two hundred bundle for keeps
The shit was so good I was Pookie for two weeks
Luckily, I bounced back, but I stopped sellin cream
Now this is like one big dream, oh girl

For the day of my diminishing, 
Why don't somebody finish them off and put it right through his cross
The X is the 50 y'all got to be kidding me
These niggaz is my sons I raised them from young
Curtis and little Earl should of been little girls

Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy?
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day (WHAT?)
Every time right before we shower and pray (HA!)
You damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God

I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen

Your instructor for today is, Tech N9ne!

[Tech N9ne]
This is style I use pitch, to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switching the pattern, bust out that quick midwest chatter
Some people hate but it ain't mattering, but the people gather, it's flattering
Switching the pitch, mixing, there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spitting full clips on a mission for bliss when I be ripping this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies, if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singing off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction, don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid

My killer Daytons can keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty, if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm putting swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

It's like lightning, how I'm striking a trifling rifleman
Bullets flying up and I'm numbing the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling! (yeah!)
Chino be curdling blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana, than half of you rappers on the radio!
Starting drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
with a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van (damn)
I'm demented, spitting writtens as sick as I can
Grenade gripping, fitting to detonate Disneyland
I am teaching Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go pick up
Answer the horn, it's blowin at you, you cold stiff up
My heat, heatin my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers

'Bout to change the game, 'bout to fly the desert, eagle

Every bullet's a note
I write with a firing pen every time the, trigger pull it's a quote
Inside a poof full of smoke
Sniffin lines of that gunpowder I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat
And a turtleneck
The best rapper alive could be the best rapper that died, a murderous
If you ain't get it by now I'm suicidal
I'm wild, a nigga better than me is who I ain't heard of yet
So I ain't murdered yet
He ain't even been born, his momma's a virgin, she ain't even furtile yet
Prepare to get back - next time you take a shit
Stand and turn around and look in the toilet then compare me to THAT
Don't compare me to none of these motherfuckin

Crooked I,"I broke down a while ago
Finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs I had are undefeated
I feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
Its been so many times I've lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut
Don't want you to notice me
Roll with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback I fee l like I got the right too
So if you need a case in point you can refer to Budden
And it will prove that pain killers never murdered nothing
All it did was make me succumb put ice in me
Now revenge is the place it takes me from
I'm strong

[Chorus]
Strong enough to catch contact (?)
Smell it as soon as you get in my ride
See with me, rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really f-ck with me
Tell me if you wanna ride or die, la la la la la la la la

Listen up as the center reports
My inner thoughts are like a inner war
Head exact as a trembling force on my mental ward
Men are distraught
Every word from his sentence the boss
It's brought to you like the people your minister's Porsche
Tight roping on dental floss
Before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost
When as soon as the temperature frost I'm probably
Having intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condo's at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to accidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws
Until then lets let the bass kick
Take the shots great I don't see a need to chase it
Trying to fight the urge til there's something to replace it
I welcome ya'll to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

[Chorus]

Yo, me and the game would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
They make sure you bring change for a hundred
Rob em, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the breaks off em
Then how the f-ck was he gon pedal off
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pac gave my mom the needle like go on try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga can harm me
So I go and scoop a mommy that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her, bet you wouldn't mind shilling it
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took like a soldier
Since she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start to handle life you'll be on the same level

[Chorus]

Crooked I
When I was five this what my father said
I should have pulled you out and left you on your momma's waterbed
You asked me, my poppa's dead
Alcoholic jeans from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me on your stainless I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
My life was the craziest
Surprised I'm even walking, can you blame me if I'm atheist
But I ain't Stephen Hawkings
I know God is in my radius
I can see him walking in the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher,s talking
My people sleep in coffins I miss em I'm breaking 
Down in the face of a bad bitch that I'm supposed to be taking down
Baby ride while I'm crying, I'm dying inside
Cause my pain is beside a giant leviathan and I'm hiding from the World
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic? same place I vomit when I lick a drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think!

Don't think I'll live a life of keeping score
I know there's something more to life
I'm sure, no, I won't be your villain anymore, anymore

I played my part, I tried to do your way
But now it's time for me to just do me
You see, I don't want to haunt you or be selfish

Crooked I,"Maybe it's time I change religions on you turning Christians
To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfucking movie

But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Crooked I,"Dominick Senior let me tell you what the maAnnotaten's about
I don't dress weird and talk funny to stand out
You pushin quarters, petty hustlers get ran out
Put that quarter back in your pocket unless he Dan Fouts
True vision, I ride around on a food mission
Don't get in the way of nutrition, my dude listen
The tool's hidden, yeah I keep that wig splitter under my gat like a beautician with a tooth missing
Green pieces of paper, weed trees from Jamaica
16 Bars, 16 keys and a scraper
These are the things that a street G see when he major
Tell the chef at Pappadeaux preseason my gator
I kick a flow off the loud, then I flow off the dome just to throw off the crowd
A nigga in his 30's ain't no Mohawks allowed
Catch a ho off my smile
A gorilla lookin' nigga eating a banana in my Range Rover
Them snowbunnies smelling pheromones from a lane over
Ain't no I in team, but it's two ""i's"" in Wii
And when we go Black Ops nigga, game over
Kill em all until nothing is left homie
I do this while I'm chillin' with the cousin of death
Think I'm from Wu-Tang how I'm fuckin' with Meth
My crew slang, keep that under your breath, we move things
Moving top speed to the top we, you can not be serious nigga that you can stop me
I don't do what's popular, I overlook you like a good view does the city through some new binoculars
You gettin' money you can mob with us, I'm flashy like a shootout between 2 photographers
Still they call the security when Crook strolled in
I'm really just a deep thinker dressed in wolf's clothing
I got a pulse but my wrist looks frozen
Fuck with me and death's door is gettin' pushed open
Funny how a hater want to stop a nigga's shine
Make me wanna grab the Glock, cock it, and pop it in his mind
Instead I'mma pour a shot, top it with some lime
I'm sippin' on vodka strong as Chewbaca in his prime
Thinkin' God forgive, He's kind, so opposite of mine
So I'mma hit the grind til I'm the topic of the time
See I'm confident that competition's hoppin' into line to fall victim to apocalyptic rhymes
So poppin' shit is fine, not to my face, say it to my back
Cuz I'm ahead of you whack niggas, blame it on a fact
When your paper get jammed up, blame it on a fax
While I'm in Saks snatchin' everything hangin' on the racks
I used to reach out 'til my arm would get tired
I ain't reachin' out no more, that offer expired
Matter of fact, this entire song is coffin inspired
Draw then I fire, you fell off, you lost the desire
Caught Alzheimers, forgot the lost art of the raw rhymer
G-shot, niggas all kinda small timers
This tune is an open wound to a salt miner
C.O.B we A Few Good Men like Rob Reiner
That's why them hoes be on us when we with Mr. Porter
Told you we gettin' head or tail quick as you flip a quarter
Think of the best rappers alive from 5 to number 1

Kings wear crowns nigga, I said kings wear crowns

Crooked I you a pharaoh, keep your eye on the sparrow
If she fly let me bone, I'll supply you with marrow
Met you in the club, I'm surprised you was there though
Mingling with the scrubs, vampires and weirdos
I valet in front of the zombies and tricks
The paint on the coup as white as Abercrombie and Fitch
Tried to find me a bitch
Tried to find me a mommy that remind me of origami
If mommy bends and folds then mommy is the shit
Fuckin' her boobs, salami her tits
Nothin' to prove, you hard with this dick I nut and I move
Baby, I'm an apex predator
Half a million in cash in the bag and a bad credit score
The body is her temple, I need a better door
Couple of windows I work in on myself, that's the metaphor
Hit the cheddar boy, I'm on a gold mine
Crooked had that diamond supply before the closed line

Born dirt poor, I balled in my 20's
Though I'm in my 30's now, [?] 30 thou
I kill em [?] style, walking out of that Wells Fargo
In a black label Ralph, talking that 2 button cargo
MILFS scanning me like a barcode
Another queen on deck, let's see what the cards hold
Horoscope dope when Crooked I is in star mode
Striking various poses, iced out son of Mary and Joseph
Dressed to kill like the terrorists wearing explosives
Beware of my focus, oh shit

Even the women that wanna kill me with the knife
Cause they heard about other women I'm givin' em the pipe
I'm knowing the way that a nigga living isn't right

Half of me wants to be happily married with a family, just like plenty of dudes
But the other half wanna keep fucking these bad ass bitches out here who keep sendin' me nudes
I know a lot of men been in my shoes
Crooked so confused, when he winning he lose
He winning in the fuck a bad bitch category
But he losing with the shallow ass women he choose
I mean, god almighty, look at the body
On little mommy, fo sho, you a hotty
Knew where I would stand so she waited in the lobby
She a predator, I'm her prey and she shot me

And my chick been patient for all my of fornication
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all

Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned me
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all
Cheating so how can my family evolve

You there? You ask if I care? The answer is yeah
You ask me to swear, I know it ain't fair, I know I'm a player
You where? Why are you there?
How can I be mad if she flipped the script
Tired of lies and decide to hop dick-to-dick
Crying her eyes out in my house
Decide to find out how I feel if another nigga lick the uh
Some niggas won't admit it but I'm telling you that we don't give a fuck if we've been cheating
We don't want you getting even
We don't even want you leaving even though we been creeping and meeting people in the mother fucking hotel
We be like ""oh well"", wax that ho tail, then I make a song about it
I give the bitch some bars like no bail, Peace Prize Nobel
Feeling fucked up when it's all over the real shit begin
A guilt trip again, and she sick of going through thick and thin

Can anybody feel me? Can anybody feel me?
I'm talking bout the real me
And the real me is guilty of putting many women in the eye of the storm
Is it true sound Crooked I is on
Every song ain't gon' have a happy ending, the old lady said I would die alone
If I don't change all of my ways, I'mma live all of my days
In a daze under the haze of a cloud full of darkness
Can't swallow the pain and the pain's all in my brain
And I can't follow the maze, man I'm lost, I ain't heartless
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, me standing on my own
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, how did I end up all alone

Tryna get off the last ounce in the track

That's our lifestyle, stunt hard, gun large
Pickin' em up not givin' a fuck about a gun charge
Zippin' em up in a body bag, fuck niggas mad
Welcome to our house, dead rappers in the front yard
I ain't Steve Nash, nobody get a pass
I found the nigga that made a top 50 hot MC list
And my Glock committed sodomy and shot him in the ass
Standin' over his body I probably shoulda asked
Why the greatest rappers gotta be somebody from the past
Compared to Slaughterhouse, a lot of niggas trash
Followin' a fad, what would I do if they follow the Slaughter
They prolly swallow this hollow and a mag
Tongue full of dung, it's shit talkin'
Niggas want me dead, fuck it I'm still walkin'
Enemies in the club, fuck it I'm still parkin' the coupe
First put the roof on a milk carton
Walked in, they hand me the mic
Told baby girl it gotta be tonight
My bed or your bed?
Yeah I'm thinking with both heads
You know, great minds think alike

What you got under that skirt? (let me get it)
Vodka, Henny and that purp (let me get it)
Cribs, cars and net worth (let me get it)
Slaughterhouse gang, Tech N9ne go and get it

Lot of molly, an out of body experience
I'm feeling kind of Gotti and all ya'll into weird events
A party prolly jolly counsel me when I'm on heroine
With the shotty ridin' when I party it's Abu Dhabi
Who can I pick it up, wick it up I'm a rip it up
And I'm gonna get up in my zone now
Fuckin' the women I'm up and I'm winnin' I'm [?] now
Pussy poundin' I'm pushin' polygamy procedures
Packin' and poppin' pretty penis pockets I please her
These I ease, Techa Neez got the bees of an evil deed
But I'mma G, never see us
With a telescope nigga cause it's hella dope
I got so many worshipers with me, I could sell a quotes
I yell the most, I tell the goat
I'm gonna take it even if they hate it and fill the boat
Fellas, you tell us to gel it, we're gonna quell his hope

Frightening life like some lye in your Visine
Psyche swiped clean, high as the hygiene

Tecca Nina keep KCMO on the fitted
Any Slaughterhouse gang affiliation I'm fuckin' with it

Crooked I,"I got a question for you
When you see another human being who's being treated worse than a disease
On his knees, beggin' please, for egg and cheese
Or anything to eat do you see his test as a lesson for you
Or do you move on say ""fuck em"", ignore em
Can't do nothing for em, if this is true, let me count your blessings for ya
You could be fighting hunger, not the Gandhi type hunger strike fighting for something right
I mean fighting the type of hunger a little girl in the third world
Fights everyday 'til her stomach is nothing but something that her spine is hiding under
Only been alive 5 summers
Hunger pains, her heart beating like some live drummers
It's beating harder, then she drop, died
Momma lost a daughter 'cause they ain't have food and drinking water
God damn I shed a tear in the booth
'Cause when I say it I'm simultaneously hearing the truth
But do you care?

[Chorus]
I need to know if you care
We dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothing to eat
But does anybody care?
(Are you there?
Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there, to care.)

Like Zero Dark Thirty we saw terror
Growing up in the hood, a small error
In judgement can make your parents become some pallbearers
For nothing, they saw Eric and he gangbanged, but they can't aim
So them straight shots caught ??? for nothing, do you care what
Get involved, get out of your chair, stand the fuck up
Do something, don't lie down and do nothin
Five rounds, hit him in his side now
Blood paints the streets of the Chitown since the news [?]
When is the truce coming?
Violence hit a new summit
And the view from it allows us to see the youth plummet
Gotta be sad, colostomy bags, shots got teenagers rockin' a new stomach
And I ain't saying that this rap was perfect
But I'm strapped with purpose
Trying to get past the surgeons in that emergency room
But if I don't get past the casket service
Just write this shit on my tomb
Nobody care

I fuck with some street killers and D dealers
We out to market everything, even 3 wheelers
I fuck with some blunt smokers and E-pillers

Then I tell your ho put on her fuck dress
Give me brains for fame, that's success

They parked you in the parking lot before you can even set it

Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there’s no remorse
Maybe the lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals

Lighter than a feather when I fly cause I'm clever

Better than the beef ends

Yo, yo
Yo I'msa gangsta, so why'all niggas, know that I mask
I smoke, mad weed, while I drink a V-8 splash
Niggas, fuck with me, and you will get smashed
I'm gettin', head in the whip, and I won't even crash
I'm sayin', niggaz don't fuck no mo', all we get is head
Niggas don't play with bread and butter, all we count is bread
My niggas from, Mississipp-I, still get high
Off the water-water, slangin' quarter-quarter
Across the border border, Sergeant Slaughter Slaughter
My Down South niggas, yo we got mad game
And we both, from the ghetto, so we kick it the same
You call your weed chronic, we call our weed hydro
You call your shit doja, we call out shit gamble
From the Calliope to Iraq, we still get dough
We call a, bitch is a bitch, and a hoe is a hoe
Penalty the label, in New York, we on cable

[Chorus]

[Crooked Lettaz]
Check it out
Basically, you silly niggas ain't facin' me
I turn my back and then you chase me hate me daily
And you attempt to limp like you'se a pimp
But you'se a shrimp, you can't play me
See we the brothers with the hot tracks
Puttin' butter on the hot wax
You want to ball with the top cats
Well you talk about fat gats
You can't rap nigga stop that, got that
You want to act like you cock back
Couldn't hold a nigga jockstrap
We can take it to the streets when the party people meet
Tell the niggaz take a seat take a beat and cold rock that
Back to the M-I, mill'n-dol'-mill'n-dol'-I
Mill'n-dol'-mill'n-dol'-I, humpback, humpback
Watch a nigga jump back, dead I
Spittin' that upon the red eye, flyin' to the N.Y.
Niggas high from coast to coast
Keepin' it close, put it in a post
E.T. the coach, niggas want to be me the most
You boast and brag and sport the sag
Cause I dope rhyme, niggas never want to quote rhymes
Try to bite and then you choke rhyme
Rollin up a smoke rhyme
Comin' out with your wrote rhyme
Ain't nothin' but some broke rhymes
Me I got the right rhymes, always comin' out tight rhymes
Break a nigga see the light rhymes
Want to fight rhymes? Naw nigga not tonight rhymes
Get your girl I just might rhyme
And the story go, for the thugs even Nore know
The gory flow, can't be faded
Prayed it down, laid it down, and I'm gone
Take double-steps turn around and show em

[Chorus]

[Crooked Lettaz 2]
Now it's that Crooked Letta hot shit
Old block rockin' locked quick
Rhymes shined with hot spit
Why'all speak about shine I write rhymes
Then I burn clicks, and give em this
Your platinum plaque's counterfeit
You shipped gold, is what I was told
Your airplay was bought hits
Payola Motorola cell phones
Where you spent all these ends, then he's gone
In the wind poof, ain't no proof, a super sleuth
Couldn't find his shoes
I wrap heads, like bad news
And bust bass and blow a fuse
Then I move to Baton Rouge like, Snoop on the move
I'm like Megatron, an underground rap shit phenomenon
I blow up in my Prime (And after that?)
Then I move to Cybertron, with Omega Supreme
But it seems that I gotta sit back and pray (Back and pray)
To God that these niggas won't take me away (Why?)
I say it seems that I gotta sit back and pray
To God that these niggas won't take me away

Want to see them niggas bouncin'
Want to see them niggas bouncin'!

Fuck that shit, let the shit glisten

Why all niggas need to go Uptown right now

1st Verse 
(J Da Groova) 

(If I want to free?) my mind 
I feel pain and stress 
accompanied by fear of falling  and war 
Gotta hold my breath 
and stay afloat 
What I wrote 
to complement what I feel 
But now my feelings turn to dust 
as I dictate what's real 
Now, all this shit people care about, 
that's made by man 
When all that shit's all gone 
There's nothing left in your hands 
I tried to crush pieces of coal into diamonds 
My timing 
was off, couldn't cope 
with what this life had brought 
But now I realize 
I have to let that bullshit cease 
If something good happens to me, 
it makes the bad increase 
Even unconsciously 
these frauds be hunting me 
in my dreams 
Teaching a lesson, 
that life ain't always what it seems 
Gotta keep these blessings 
At last, 
time is running out fast 
what the future holds 
always coincides with the past 
You never know the shit I'm feeling 
when I'm staring at the ceiling 
J Da Groova, Crooked Lettaz, 
doing mental cap peelings 

(chorus) 

I remember WHEN 
remember then 
remember WHAT? 
remember WOODS 
in grandma house 
deep in the cut 
eating chicken and swine 
now I write dope rhymes 
good times 
is so hard to find 
It's on my mind 

(repeat) 

2nd Verse 

(Kamikaze) 

We the last line 
of defense 
That's why the South remain calm 
in all this nonsense 
They cloning sheep 
Next week, 
boi, they'll be cloning you 
Now while you steady claiming coasts 
with your silly crew 
I got stew 
and we be nuetral to your black and white 
So, we be ready 
when the folks come at us late at night 
To all you representing rappers 
up in low fatigues 
You keep it real 
but them woods 
keep it out your league 
They got a freeze on your money 
but you ain't gon' want it 
'cause there's a concentration camp 
with your name on it 
and, doggonit, 
they gonna get you with this devil tax 
They got your whole act on file at the (Equalfax???) 
I can't relax 
Mastercard say (they won't take cash?) 
I'm a ??????? 
A mad dash up the charts 
won't even get you straight 
A platinum plate 
and some cake 
and you still paying late 
Your royalties 
is just like spoiled cheese 
on a platter 
by the time you see a cent 
boy, it won't even matter 
There's fatter rhymes 
and fatter beats 
Congressmen in seats 
Your little raps won't even last 
in this world of cheats 

(chorus 2x) 

3rd verse 

(david banner) 

The sun shines 
on the South 
I'm ready to take my clique 
on this deathbed 
and (do this thing?) y'all killing me with 
The (design?) 
pierces my brain 
with this bullet from hell 
(the damn ride?), '99 
killed my cousin Michelle 
One wrong turn, 
her body fell 
25 feet 
Her skull split 
up into bits 
on the cold concrete 
And in the streets, 
little kids getting shot in the face 
ever since being housed, 
y'all in the wrong place 
And I know (this Coca Cola boils to crack?) 
Now a child got AIDS from being fucked from the back 
y'all ask (if the?) struggle hit me 
If I'm here for the next verse, we all gon' see 
Put on ""Triggerman"" 
(death don't hurt?) 
Man, I got this gun from a smoker 
and the shit don't work

Know what I'm talkin 'bout, check it out

(Pimp C)
Sweet Jones, in a foreign car, shinin like a muthafuckin superstar
I'm sippin the bar, grippin the grain
I got 17 karats in my piece a chain
I been a young pimp nigga since I was a kid
Mama would be 'shamed of all the things I did
Like cookin the stones and bustin caps out the 'rome
I keep a chip in my phone and put key domes in ya home
I'm the trillest of the trill, you the fakest of the fake
Pussy-ass niggas in the club tryna playa hate
While I'm standin here draped in diamonds
I ride with made niggas, some choppin on blade niggas
Survive enemies, Mississippi get paid niggas
They lay ya lup in ya lap, and let the pistol dome clap
And it ain't all about this rap shit bitch nigga
Handle the business with the muthafuckin chrome trigga

(Chorus-Pimp C)
Now if you heard what I said then get crunk, get crunk
Now if you heard what I said then get crunk, get crunk
Now get buck, now get buck
And pop ya pussy if you don't give a fuck
Now if you heard what I said then get crunk, get crunk
Now if you heard what I said then get crunk, get crunk
Now get buck, now get buck

'You make most of ya cheese off production and shows'
See it's all good, lift up ya seat, don't piss on the wood
If these niggas feelin froggy, let 'em come to the hood
It's all gravy daddy, get crunk, get crunk
Talk shit bitch, and get stomped, get stomped

Don't ever talk to police, don't let 'em know just where you sleep

And early Christmas we gon' gets it, 
'cause me and see we 'bout to spit it

To get this shit, it keeps it hot
Then sell it back to make this knot

But shit them same hatin niggas is on them streets where I stay
We go from Jackson back Texas, want some action come and check us
Got that love then come and bless us, 
Think we soft then come and test us

I never grew up in the ghetto but I spits that shit
And got a team that'll get you and you won't be missed
I don't drink Cris, you like it at the top of your list
But never figured how you did it 'cause it tastes like piss
I'd rather sip the two fingers till I make me a fist
And take a break from revolutions so I could hit you wit this
You took you first advance money, put it dead on yo' wrist
Or all them big-body strippers wit them big ol' tits
But man I see them same hookers and just blow em a kiss
'cause they the ones who used to dis before I made these hits
Before I had the turkey bacon wit mahamony grits
Before a nigga hit the pits and started rhymin for kicks
Nigga, you fuck wit Kamikaze, you gon' sleep wit the fish
That why when you see me commin, you just creep in yo' six

They got the west coast hatin folks on the east
They know we lazy, now we back and ?market the beast?
That paper money, soon they gon' have no mo'
Right now they buildin houses wit computer chips in the flo'
So they know when you at home and when you ain't
And when you use that smart bank card, you in the paint
Let me break it down, they called it the New World Foundation
And when you use it, they know your exact location
And what you spit, and what you spit that ?own is your line?
That leave a mark, now they got that card in your mind
And in your skin, shit don't mean nuttin to them
And then power is the gold passion for us to defend
And when they get that money, yo' value ain't shit
'cause they got all yo' cheese and the see on the chip

Now you give up all yo' money and yo' jewels at my command
Stand in line for twenty hours, application says denied
want to see a 9-to-5 but couldn't work it if I tried
Man you lied, didn't give me my forty acres and a mule
Now it's back to sellin crack to all your children after school
Fools rush, when I rap you better hush, I'm in yo' place
Ain't no chance to see my face, I'll make yo' memory erase
Taste the steel as I point it oh so lovely at your dome
Tell your wife to hit the canvas while I violate your home
Then I'm gone up out the window, if you slip then I'll be back

I've been around a lot of individuals who think they got game

Perpretratin the fraud against God as I observe
And despite what you may have heard
I don't forgive but I do give you what you deserve
Now my homey's kickin these nouns and verbs
Have acquired me to unnerve these cats wit shoddy dialect
Who see women as sex, I see them as another check
Or an opportunity to get my name on a title of a Lex
Havin only paid my respect
Overstand I'm not one-sided
I'm just one up on the misguided sistas and brothas
I'm a capitalist, they lovers
While they buyin red rubbers I'm purchasin briefcases that cover
Green sheets wit caucasians who sold it over our black mothers
People say pimpin lost its morals
I say that must be territorial 'cause my people stay deep like corals
As my coronary and cerebulum collaborate and make me historical

Been a long time, the South stays on my mind
I'm a grown man and everything is fine

Nobody gives a damn about my place of origin
Jacktown, rounds of empty shells left on the ground
Still smokin'
I'm hopin' to give the kids something back
Instead of wild-ass stories about sellin' vials of crack
Or bitches and cars, but my state left scars
On my man hood, while y'all be screamin' that it's all good
When it ain't never been, most kids move to Chicago
And those that didn't were left hollow
Wit low self-esteem but it seems that all my dreams got crushed
But y'all niggas kept it on the hush
So why y'all frontin' on the South, come and get some
Ask your scared-ass parents where you from, you crumb

My God, these lyrics hot, you're gonna need sunblock
My verbal's cocked wit ammunition
For you shiesty A&R's who be dissin'
You missin', the Southern fried cookin', who you lookin' at?
Bustin' lyrics from the soundproof straight to DAT
In fact, I'm sick of how you brothers react
My demo says Mississippi but I ain't speakin' 'bout no gats
But my raps, are laced wit homicidal tendencies
A Menace like Dennis be, bustin' rhymes from here to Tennessee

Cops rang, my man he done bled to death
And the ambulance done came and left
I'm by myself, with your traces 
And my yard you know it's hard, mentally-scarred
Brain-barred little cousin Joe, I done seen the whole thing
I can't seem to get my hands clean
Done washed em twelve times in a row, twelve rhymes is spoke
Twelve dimes but it doesn't ease the pain
Suggestion, (ah, excuse me Mr. Crump can we ask you some questions)
Don't ask me no questions

[Chorus: x2]

Now shortly, it be that portly MC from the M-G-T
North Jackson, Mississippi where them brainiacs be
Ain't no hustlers, no gangstas, no slangers an' thugs
The only test for your vest will be verbal slugs
And mean mugs get shrugged out quick, it ain't no fightin'
Just down home receitin', and some dope lyric writin'
Tighten your skills, before you cross the border into hell
It's that mack, know your state where them stow-aways dwell

Hopin all my partners stay for real
Can you say boy Crooked Lettaz ain't for real?
'Cause we makin that shit that the playas feel
You done made a deal, 'cause ya tape don't hit
Talk that talk, and ya boy can't spit
Ain't no bigger than a small time
Lav, get my money, better find that trick
Stick, move, can't, lose, do them shows, pay them dues
Hip-hop, worldwide, Mississippi, play them blues
Choose life, through the strife
Take some kids, and a wife
Knife, edge, cut a wedge
Keep ya juice and know the ledge
Dead, still, run a mil, south niggas keep it trill for real

(Chorus)

(Crump)
These demons searchin for my soul, they gettin closer and warm
Enemies in pale skin in my physical form
No, it's funny, 'cause I don't even mourn for the day
I can't get these white pictures of Jesus outta my head
The preacher's Bible said there's no depiction of Christ
But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???
They rather play in my mind and send us all to hell
But I'm here to tell the truth, fuck the myths and the lies
But what's bad they can't even look me straight in my eyes

(Chorus)

(Crump and Kamikaze-talking)
I'd like to say this shit 
wouldn't have ever happened without our man ---, 
you know what I'm sayin
He laid this shit down for here, and his little daughter, 
you know what I'm sayin
You'll make this trill for us daddy, you know what I'm sayin
So trill, so trill, so trill, so trill, so trill
Much love, everybody that keep it trill
All the trill niggas
Missippii, Jacktown, lil' Africa baby, 
everybody in the NY lookin out for us, 
Chi-Town, Cali baby, all over the world daddy
It don't matter where you from it's trill everywhere you go
Texas, Atlanta, Tennessee
You know what I'm sayin, 
they tryin to make you think the same shit ain't 
happenin on the west coast, that's happenin on the east coast, 
this shit is happenin to all us worldwide 
London, Africa, the same trill shit goin on
Our folks is hurtin, shit is trill, Australia
Bullshit, it don't matter
(Nah man, I'm sick of this shit)
It don't matter, trill right here man,

Crooked Pine Stringband,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,
Crooked Pine Stringband,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2003
Crooked Still,"When first I came to Louisville 
Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington 
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks
Her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora
The Lily of the West

I came to my love Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned in to another man
Which sort of stressed my mind
She robbed me of my loyalty
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West

Now down in yonder shady grove
The man who was to come
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sort of me oppressed
I was betrayed by Flora 
The Lily of the West

I stepped up to my rival 
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly made him stand
We met in desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed the man for Flora 
The Lily of the West

I had to stand my trial 
I had to make my plea
They placed me in a criminal box
And then commenced on me
Although she sold my life away
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West",Flora,2005
Crooked Still,"Captain, Captain, tell me true does my sweet Willie sail with you?
No my dear, he isn't here for he is drowned in this ocean, dear

Answer me, oh give me joy for I love my soldier boy
Oh no, lady, he's not here. Dropped down dead in the gulf, my dear

Get me a chair to sit upon, and pen and ink, come write it down
On every line I will shed a tear: on every verse cry oh, my dear.

Captain, Captain, build me a boat, out on these waters I must float
Searching for my Willy dear, for he has drowned in this ocean dear

Crooked Still,"She went into the graveyard with trouble on her mind.
She was lookin' for the man who make her crazy. 
From her big brown coat she puller a silver knife.
As she held it in her hand, her heart was racing. 

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

Its been nine long years since you took my hand. 
I'll never understand what made you do it,
And how you twisted up my soul, through me in a hole.
I didn't come this far to see you through it

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

Babe, I'm sorry for you, but it's what I have to do. 
You died that night beneath the leaves have fallen, 
And the devil will stand by; smilin' bright, his pitchfork high.
A ghost from all these graves will come a callin'.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

So she stabbed him in the heart.
Her shinning blade it ripped apart 
His skin and pierced thought the center,
And I lay my body down, through me on the ground,
And cover me so I can hide from my dominator. 

You're low down and dirty, 
So low down.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. (x3)
If I stay I'll never find my way back home,
",Low Down and Dirty,2008
Crooked Still,"Over yonder in the graveyard 
Where the wild, wild flowers grow
There they laid my own true lover
She'd gone from me, forever more

Fairer than the sweetest flower
Restless as the wildest way
Pored in with love deep as a ocean 
This is the girl that I did win

I left her there back in the mountain
To see the world riches to gain
Oh, when I returned no earthy treasure 
Could ease this heart so filled with pain

They saw high above the mountain 
Beneath that little mound of clay 
The girl that I returned to marry 
So stand a mound of flowers did lay

I'll go lay you down and wonder 
Lay aside my earthy gain
All I am undone in riches
Undone in sorrow I'll remain
Undone in sorrow I'll remain",Undone in Sorrow,2008
Crooked Still,"Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back for a little more

You got my heart you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
You got the diamonds from the mine
Well that's all right, it'll buy some time

Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
Feeling foolish, and that's for sure

Just waiting here at your kitchen door?

Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?

Crosby & Nash,"I tried to reach beyond the walls you're living in
As a friend I flew a long way for a friend
But the way you treated me
Made me feel like giving in
I don't know if I'll break or only bend
You're supposed to be my friend

And if you carry on the way you did today
All the music in my veins will turn to stone
All the faking of your friendship
Doesn't make it anyway
Does it get you off to act so all alone
It'll chill you to the bone

So my advice to you is not to take advice
From the dealers who are handing out the cards
Take your life into your own hand

Because you make it much to hard.",Frozen Smiles,1972

Or thinkin' that I loved you
More than you loved me
Failing to lay it on the line

The game of gettin' money
The game of gettin' more
The ego game of power

Can there be anything
Left for you to prove?
You have already made your move
Don't you even know who you are

To the sound of a woman-a woman crying
Crying for a roomful, a roomful of dreams,
Dreams dying.

You've got a ticket to ride on this train
By the way, you're gonna ride it alone
Alone.

It's a low down payment on this pillar
Pillar of salt
It's only had one owner, and he up and died
He died of guilt.

That will blow it apart,
That's if you can even get it to start.

If it had a heart-some kinda heart.",Low Down Payment,1975

Beneath the sunshine and the icicles
In the things that you think.

There's a hole in my destiny
And I'm out on the brink
Mama lion, mama lion
She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks
She's taking her time from her grandfather clocks.
And over the border, and down on the land
She's living in the future
And it lies in her hand

Crosby & Nash,"The clown sat speechless, looking in his mirror
Unable to remember how to paint his face
Staring at the image, slowly getting clearer
Wondering if his fear or his heart would win the race

When it dawns on you
What it takes from you
Living under clouds of pain
There's a storm in you

You don't know what to do
Just when you think you're going insane

when I need the sun's heat
I need the heat, oh both way

Was as battered and worn a one as you have ever seen.
But I made it some new wings and painted the nose,
And I wished so hard up in the air I rose, singing

Carry me, carry me
Carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me.

And I once loved a girl
She was younger than me
Her parents kept her locked up in their life
And she was crying at night,
And she was wishing she could be free.

Course mostly I remember her laughing
Standing there watching us play.
For a while there, the music would take her away
And she'd be singing

Carry me, carry me
Carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me
Carry me above the world.

And then there was my mother:
She was lying in white sheets there and she was waiting to die.
She said, ""If you'd just reach underneath this bed
And untie these weights,
I could surely fly.

She's still smiling but she's tired,
She'd like to hear that last bell ring.
You know if she could she would
Stand up, and she could sing, singing

Carry me above the world

And you started crying 'cause you bent the key,

It's still lying there where some careless wave
Forgot it long ago
When I awoke this morning
Dove beneath my floating home
Down below her graceful side
In the turning tide
To watch the sea fish roam
And there I heard a story
From the sailors of the Sandra Marie
There's another isle a days' run away from here
It's empty and free
From here to Venezuela nothing more to see
Than a hundred thousand islands
Flung like jewels upon the sea

I found me a tree
And the fruit that we live on
Reminds me of me

And I don't really have much to say

Cause I'm Living from day to day
Somewhere

They never make five

We all can survive

Keep us alive

Sometimes it's hard to catch the wind
And bend it to your will

Just how the story ends

Lay me down in the river
And wash this place away
Break me down like sand from a stone

Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down

A soul knows where it's been
I want to feel my spirit lifted up
And catch my breath again

Crosby & Nash,"I can't say we won the war
But I can say we survived
Unlike some of your close friends
Who died standing by your side
Did they serve their Country well?
Fighting in a winless war
Soldiers on both sides can't tell
What it is they're fighting for

What were they dying for?
I guess somebody lied
And families felt the pain
As many mothers cried
And when we bought into the lie
Who was counting up the cost
Underneath a foreign sky
So many lives were lost
Their memory will live on, live on
The wall and all its casualties
Live on, live on
Carved in stone for all to see
Live on, live on

Of the soldiers who have died
And the names upon the wall
Forever carved in stone

To reach a far off sea
Who will fall in battle? Who will be the first to flee?

Even though yesterday
I know I let you down

You were naked on the table
In the arms of another woman
On the other side of town

I left you laughing with a stranger
But I confess that I knew
She was gonna bring you pain

When she offered you a needle
It was long and it was shining
And I saw it bring you down

Phosphorescent lights harshly sounding
The buzzing in my ears getting louder
Flies bash their brains against the window pane
Let's get out of here

I wouldn't hurt you for the world
And the worst of it is
I've got to take you back again

And I don't know how I'll make it
Maybe someone else should hold you
On the other side of town

Trees are dying in the middle of the courtyard
The daughter in the doorway wanted silver
The other woman is already leaving
Let's get out of here

And I don't mean to stare

And look into their lives
As you hand them a spoon
As you polish the knives

A life without laughs

Hide from the one who really loves me

Outrun my own demise

I'm my own worst enemy
Every choice that I make
Is a four letter mistake

I'm still trying to get free
So let your light come down on me
Before I waste another day
Heaven help me

Help me to lessen my control
And to love the letting go
Keep me from feeling so
Divided when I know
That the love in front of me
Is exactly what I need

Heaven help me on my way
I'm my own worst enemy
Every choice that I make
Is a four letter mistake

I'm still trying to get free
So let your light come down on me
Before I waste another day
Heaven help me, help me on my way

Sweet as can be
One tiny pearl
In the terrible sea

I took her from
Under the deep
Some kind of luck's
Been visiting me

This I know is true
I'm the one for you

You're the only one I want
You're the only one I really need
You're the only one that I trust
So won't you put your trust in me?

Everywhere where I want to be
We fit together perfectly
I don't need nobody else
'Cause you're the only one for me

First time we met
Told everyone I knew
I was gonna get you
Whatever I do

I've had some time
To think it all through
Listen to what
I'm telling you

There's one thing I know
I'll never let you go, no

You're the only one I want
You're the only one I really need
You're the only one that I trust
So won't you put your trust in me?

Everywhere where I want to be
I wanna keep you next to me
I don't need nobody else
'Cause you're the only one for me

You're the only one I want
You're the only one I really need
You're the only one that I trust
So won't you put your trust in me?

Everywhere I want to be
Love you times infinity

All lit up in dashboard light

All the mindless chatterin' tongues

This is not like the movies

Where everything fades to black
And it's all happy endings
But that's just pretending
'Cause the world doesn't work like that
It's always changing
But she's sick of waiting

Her patience is over
'Cause she can see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league
She takes me way too seriously

You'd think by now she would know
That I'm hardly deserving
My kind of love doesn't always show
'Cause it's under the surface

Where everything tends to stay
I can never be lonely if nobody knows me
But I wish that it wasn't this way
I'm thinking of changing
But she's sick of waiting

Her patience is over
'Cause she can see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league

I never meant to start a fire

I take myself too seriously

I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around the dirty town
And the children let out from their schools

I was standing on a noisy corner
I was waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
He was playin' real good for free

Me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and about thirty-seven criminal
Escorting me to this halls

And I'll play if you have some money
Or if you're a friend to me
But that one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He was just playin' real good for free

Nobody, I say nobody, nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew they had never seen him on their TV screen
So they passed his music by

Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signals changed

Something to make us all happy.
Do anything, take us out of this gloom.
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who can make us all laugh.
Doing this, you break down in tears.
Please don't be sad. If it was a straight life you had,
None of us would've known you all the years.

Each time you choose to sing the rock & roll blues,
You take everybody's loneliness with you.
What do you lose each time you face down a room?
All of us see how it changes through you.

So sing of the ocean of tears you have sailed,
Of strangers and lovers that took you.
All of us sang, and all of us failed.
In one way we don't ever hear you.

They're terrified that you might go
And find out for yourself what they can't teach you

The young are punished for their disregard
For every fool who might want to lead them

And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

And I want to know- why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home
Have I driven her away? Is she gone?

Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest

I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets

I pop niggaz and don't give 'em a quarter back
And then I'm spendin that in the store where the linen at
Same night in the club where the Cris' and the women at
why'know, twenty-three with a hell of a flow
Six with no steering wheel, I just tell it where to go, uh
""Stop, make a right at the bar"" - to all the C.E.O.'s it's ten o'clock

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye

Told the chick real gangstas hard to please
Stash hard in the Honda seats

All my niggas own real estate
My money can't estimate
On the roll you can't tell the time or the day, and date

Have your bitch in the back of the Escalade
We can make things escalate
Pull out, make his man run on him and he had a gun on him
Busted you then make the right

To cut through the gas station and take the light
Can't tell me Ruff Ryders don't make it tight
Got to wonder what a Harlem, niggas life is like
And I transport keys if the price is right

Then ride back through your hood on a mountain bike
Got bullets that will go through your stomach
Then come out your head
I'm Infrared, you ain't know, I'm about this bread

And I wonder what your family gonna do

Look at the hole that you fell in
I got to spin around to keep the shells in

I might as well slow down

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said ""cool"" cause you know that I feel you Styles

I hawk niggas down, bust arteries

And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man Haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""

You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch

Rolling something up, 
Thinking about killing every rapper in the game
And holding something up

You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you

Hold up my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talking

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye

You're my smooth lover boy, my heartache and joy

To a place called Johnny's Last Stand

Center of all that I say and do.

For the record, I do confess Jesus as Lord. And I realize that without Him
You wouldn't accept any of my letters, Lord, or hear any of my prayers.
It's my surroundings though-I'm part of that hip-hop culture. But who
Would've thought that when it started as just an urban way of expressing
Reality without disregarding all moral upbringing, that it would now be
Dominated by the most profane, anti-Christ, violent, vulgar, sacrilegious
Money hungry people! What's ""bad"" is called ""good,"" what's ""good"" is called ""bad.""
Man, things are getting illa and illa. To have a million and one good times
In a man's life, and none of them involve You. Thousands of parties thrown
Throughout the year, and none of them celebrate Your existence. Who do we
Think we are Lord?

I guess a better question is: ""Who do we think You are?"" Maybe what they
Say is true, ""outta sight, outta mind."" Since we can't see You we forget
About You. But how can we forget about You when all around us there's
Reminders of the fact that You are.

This life will never be right without You in the picture. We can pretend
All we want that things are fine without You. But then the sirens of a
Squad car, or an ambulance, or a fire engine will quickly remind us that
All isn't well--we do need You! And we need You just the way You are--not
The way we want You to be. Lord I'm a part of that group that's tore up
About the breakup between God and man. I won't try to pretend like I'm
Better off without You. I'd jump at the chance to get back with You! And
Even though it's our fault that we're separated, You didn't swing on us.
Instead You put our fault on Your Son, and swung on Him! What a dope play!
And what a dope Savior! Not many people understand how significant He is.
They're blind to His true essence, and they think they're smart by trusting
In human intelligence rather than Your Word. And all this talk about,
""We're God"", I won't even go there, that's ridiculous! Lord, I'll be Your
Representative. If no one else will, I'll represent. 'Cause after all, how
Can they call on the One they don't believe in? And how can they believe in
The One they haven't heard of? And how can they hear without someone
Proclaiming the message? And how will one proclaim unless he's sent? So
Like Isaiah, send me. Equip me to reach and change my circle of influence.
And Lord I won't front, I won't front.

No one has to stay a victim of the bad news when you're a Savior who brings
Good news. Oh I know it hurts that so many will refuse such a great
Salvation. But yo Lord, I'm praising You, praising You for the few that
Will believe.
Forever Yours Lord. Much, much love.",The Love Letter [*],1998

The way a walk

Welcome to a place you've never been before
It's laid back but raw
Jesus Christ for why'all
I'm coming like a jab aimed straight to your jaw
So you better duck
When I bust· cause I'm letting off
From the door, I'ma lay some things to rest
For me it's Christ first and then this microphones next
You can boogie like the monsters, but I'll still be vexed
If what you speak is not about his most highness
Allow me if you will, to chill and build a few things
My foundation the Rescuer, The King of Kings
And Lord of Lords
Deserves more than your applause
King Jesus say His name cause he reigns why'all
For mankind, sin made a great big hole
And he became the cement filler to hold up the pole
Called life, no pun intended
You think there's more than one way I recommend you listen
Choosing Christ is not like switchin' long distance
Or choosin' what pants to wear with what shirt, it's different
Much different, extremely different like strokes
But there's no Arnold, Willis, Mr. Drummond and no jokes
I'm provoked, by a world who wants to choke me out
My light's lit, but like Fro's they want to blow me out
So I let my light shine like a frost bit bracelet
The world you living in face it
His voice shaped it
He changed the face of history and you can't erase it
Sin and death couldn't hold Him and they tried to glue and paste Him

It's been made plane like Jane to me
And doesn't take an Einstein brain to see
That if your born your gonna die and that's the way it be
So you can kill your after life philosophy
Cause if it's not Christ, your livin' slopily
Like Joe, so I flow hopin' you'll copy me
And get down with Christ who's gotta monopoly
On the universe and works without stoppin', Please!
He don't need sleep, cause he's the word, ya heard
Show me one better than Christ and it's him I'll serve
But you can't, and I'm not
And you won't, so just stop
Feeling shaken; your thing is breakin'; come stand on this Rock

I'd like to take a minute or so if I could
To drop these last packages off in your mental neighborhood
They're postmarked urgent

You to the fact that your deservin'
Of no more
Than the blaze of the torture and the scorch
But you're the next contestant, so come on down cause you've been bought
But your feeling bugged cause it seems like your caught
In your seat or ya' feet feel like they're stuck to the floor
But see the life of Our Lord
Was spread out on that Cross
So we could escape the torch
Not just for sport
No longer to be lost
If we recognize of course
That we're sinners and He's the true and living Life source
From which we must draw· it was sin and death that he fought
And when His breath left, ""Oh my God"" we thought
He took the L, but we soon saw he prevailed
So when I exhale
Oh yes, I expel myths
That outside of Christ you can know God cause He's it
High Priest, Prince of Peace, King Jesus
You better believe His name is King Jesus

Cross Movement,"The cross reconciles where sin
Is known to sever
That's why when beats and rhymes are sewn together we extol the
God whose enthroned forever

He storms the weathers and stills them
Chooses fates and seals them
Revives His children
Takes empty lives and fills them

Who's willin' to come unto the major player
Who paid the wager of all ya'll Savior-haters
And changed the nature
Of your condition and position

Sin sick to healthy, hell bound
To hell free
He inhabited frailty conquered
The grave got death and hell's keys

His side of the story compels me
To say, ""Hail Thee!""
To the Emperor, Sin-bearer
The riches of His wisdom and knowledge
Turns men from error

[Chorus: x 4]
We know the Way
We speak the truth
We live the life
'cause He's the Lord

Eternal light of men came to give sight to men
The same light that shines blinds men
Who in their own eyes are wise men
Fallen in their human ways, their dooms displayed

'Cause they refuse to remove the shades
And consume the rays
Of the Light-Giver
The Gospel's an offense

I'm aware of the hostility it might trigger
People want to battle 'n fight
'Cause they can't handle the Light
They're still stuck in the mode

Of foreshadows 'n types
After the Dark Ages came illumination
Meaning the Son was made visible
Like the fourth day of creation

To expose the deeds of men
So we can see our sin then
See the need for Him to bleed for men

[Chorus]

I think it's sad how men try to grasp
The divine truth of God
When without Christ
God and man clash

Like pok-a-dots and plaid
They say our doctrine's bad
As if explainin' God is a drop in the bag
Divine truths are concealed

Unless God chooses to reveal
What we believe is by faith
There's no need to prove it's real
""The Bible's corrupt!""

Well, that's the phrase that's getting' old
Bottom line, you're blind
To the mysteries of the written code
Are you among those whom the Son knows?

Does your hope rest in the fact that the Son rose?
When it comes to trust
People are placin' bad bets
What can be proved

Requires no faith to accept
False teachers writin' bad checks
Don't be deceived
Many believe in God

But what about God do they believe?
Is he like the old man
With the long beard
You've seen in cartoons?

Did He board the mothership
And fly to the back of the moon?
In Revelations is He the A and the Z
Or is He gonna come back and say

He lied about who He claimed to be?
Did He suffer in hell for sin
Or was His death enough?
Trust solo Cristo minus the extra stuff

[Chorus]",The Way,1999
Cross Movement,"What is life, when you ain't living right
Sight when your blind as night
Low level living, trying to perpetrate height
With all your might, you scrape, and you thug, and you fight
And refuse every invitation to come into the light
What's it like, to have to maintain
Gain, life left lane, strife, death, pain, all in vain
This world will make a lot of promise to keep you high lit
If your an earthbound thug, than you've got what you get
And don't even expect no more
You might as well plunder in this war
But also expect the god of heaven to one day tally up the score
Who you playing for, does your coach know the game
Are you shooting with a ball that's engulfed in flame
Well if your tired of contract, you saw what it paid
Hold out right now, make your team force a trade
It ain't a easy move, in fact it's hard
But only real ball players play for this real rough squad
Coached by the god, the one and only jehovah
And the first dribbling skill he teaches is the cross over
In fact he did it to perfection, without (no) question
Refer to the holy play book for accurate recollection
He seeking no names rookies, in which he never met
And those in foul trouble who admit their game is suspect
He'll turn a freshman in to an upper classer
With joy and laughter, he'll take'em higher than nasa
He can turn a pimp into a sho'nuff pastor
Turn a pathetic amateur in to a perennial master
And he'll do more than these mere power displays
He'll teach you his way, and make it john blaze
Cause ain't nothing lacking in christ
And he loves to turn a thug to the love life

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

How is it that your gonna go all out

When you really don't know what life is all about
Your wile-ing out, your wile-ing out
Thug life ain't really what you hear them claim
Somebody always seems to have a better aim
Get out the game, get out the game
When Christ comes back to collect on dues
Watch how many thugs gonna sing the blues
You better choose, yo he can't lose

All now here we go again
New day and new flow again
Mission, prove and show again
Let my sis and dun's know again
Same stizzy and plan again
Proclaim the god-man again
To the dead mannequins
Want clothes and places to stand again
On the bully, everybody's high strung like a pulley
You don't survive unless understand the game fully
So as god's aliens and strangers in this place
The only way we make it is to stay up in his face
By prayer and grace as sheep among wolves
We duck the buck shot and keep it moving with the hooves
Tell me what's rugged
To dwells with the murders and the thugged
And have a four-pound and won't even lug it
You don't want to kill but you will to keep it real
You got a lot a heat some of these cold blooded cats need to feel
Like Davy Crocket, you'll loose the hand rockets
But there's a crown of thorns that won't let you cock it
There's the one who was hit with the three spike bullets
Who bleed all on your trigger and now you can't even pull it
The shots pierced through his wrist and feet into the wood
And he took it like a savior like thug never could
Like a god, like a king, like a soldier at war
Who knew the cost of dying, and all that it was for
All for us, who would never feel his pain
But now we say to live is Christ and to die is gain
So praise the true god in his wisdom and might
Who can turn a thug to the love life

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

One day I won't cry no more
Can't wait for the day when people won't die no more
Daddy's won't say, bye no more; lie no more
In the streets bullets won't fly no more

Won't feel no pain no more
Won't have to push, pull, won't have to strain no more

Won't have to walk lame no more
Won't have to play the game no more.

One day we takin off baby and ever since the Lord saved me
I've been waitin for the day we can say, it's all gravy
It's all crazy tryin seeing to see life when its all hazy
How can I persist to do right when I'm all lazy?
Feel me? Too much pain it all ails me
Vexed, cause I can feel the effects of the Fall daily
The pain in my chest it strong, let's get on
Come Lord, quick, bring on the eschaton
End the search, start the new earth, flex your true worth
Honor your Son, let Him come, perfect the new birth
And We don't gotta prove that God is cool
Just know when God is through no more godless rule
So I'm anxious to praise the Ancient of Days
My brain's still amazed at how I can see that pain is a phase
Soon to be eclipsed at the Son's return
When we get what He gives and not what we've earned

[Chorus]

There's coming a day that'll be much better than now
No more hurts. no more work by the sweat of your brow
No more drunk drivers drivin all out of control
No more flats and being stuck on the side of the road
Believe me, no more turning on the T.V
Seeing kids say, for the price of coffee you can feed me
In fact, no more anthrax in the mail
No jail, no blizzards, no twisters, no hail
It'll be the end of rain and the end of planes
Being hijacked and flown into window panes
It'll be nice just, imagine a world that'll be righteous
No more Middle East crisis
No more drugs, and no more thugs and pimps
No more beat-downs, and no more getting mugged for timbs
No need for ramps cause no need for wheel chairs
No need for weaves cause you'll feel your real hair

[Chorus]

One day when this life is over we will live forever
together with our king

Christ is the Rock and believe me the Rock's steady
He drops heavy, so stop screaming I'm not ready
God said He's coming like a thief kid so peep it
He'll creep it's meant to be unknown like a secret
This is what many are having beef with
Gods rotisserie style can make a brothers teeth grit
Cause He's quick but according to our concept of speed
Looking at man He thought about the depth of our need
So what this means is, He's not slow, the King is
Waitin to bring kids into Christ where real Bling is
So they can sing His praise because they've seen this
God spill His blood to show love at its zenith
He proved He cut for them
Look what He gave up for them
Paid His life since you can't pay bucks for sin
Justice then teamed up with long suffering
Big ups to Him who gave you and me time to trust in Him

You're mad at the world all hot and spicey
Then wit the quickness of a swoosh like Nike
Satan did his thing and dug up in your psyche
Cause all this life gives is temporary relief
And all you really had was temporary belief
You couldnt really see the amazin deciet

Thats why we say, get a Bible and read it in its entirety
And let God deal wit you and your propriety
Check out all the cats of noteriety the variety
Of ways they deal wit the ills of society
Let it bring sobriety, let it make you firey
Cause its gonna take more then a slice of apple piety

And there's lost souls, and things that tempt em
And to Jesus there's rest and redemption

And the stanza's that modern man does are full of vanity, vulgarity and
propaganda
But I guess that's this age
We Thugs and Fools
We even stick God up and saying, ""Run the jewels!""
But God ain't the type to lay down flat
And put His hand behind His head and turn His back
He's the type to look right back down your pipe
And see the Cross in the crosshairs of your site
And be like, ""Oh you sticking me up? No you not
I'm loaning you my stuff, but you on the clock
And when that last tic-tocks, I'm coming to your block
To see what you did with my Son and with my Hip-Hop!""
So woe to all men who have abused the craft
With unjustified math and filthy cash
""Will a man rob God?"" No indeed
But that's the sin and attempt of Hip-Hop-cracy",Hip-Hop-Cracy,2004

I can almost feel the breeze

I've never been, but I'd like to go
Make 'em search for me high and low

Just when I thought all was lost
You came and made it all okay

I cant be held responsible this is all so new to me
Just when I think I'm invincible

Tonight I'll speak the words I never thought Id ever have to say to you

Then I'll leave you there all alone
One more thing you should know
I'm not ever coming home

I think we should finally let this go
We both know it's the end of the road

All I ever need was someone to believe in anything I could give
Maybe there's something beautiful hidden deep in my bones
I'll get as far as I can go
Where I run you never will know
When you're left there lyin' alone
Know I'm never coming home

I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes

And a new day will begin

Back then was when
We touched the starlight

And so you settle for whatever gets you through the night
The flame you thought was dead may suddenly begin to burn
And broken hearts can be repaired, that's something that you learn

Next time you fall in love
It better be with me
The way it used to be

Crouch End Festival Chorus,"In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

He's there
The phantom of the opera
Beware the phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is here/there

Inside my/your mind

Sing, my angel of music!

Can't take away the faces of the men that you left dead
As you ride across the badlands with a price upon your head
Now that wheel or fortune starts to turn

Your reputation's grown 'til it's the biggest in the land
And there ain't a lot of people left who wanna call your hand
And I guess you go down shooting, just like all branded men

Far from all the soot and noise of the city,
There's a village green.

Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green.

And kissed her by the old oak tree.

And so I left the village green.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say ""gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?""
And daisy's married tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.

Crouch End Festival Chorus,"Today, when she comes in,
I'll be standing at the door, and I won't say any more.
I know that she's been there.
It's not the way I look at her, it's the way she looks at me.

Yes you can hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.

When she lays on my bed,
It's not me she's thinking of, it's just me that really cares.
My time, I know is out,
And she'll be walking through that door,
And she'll lie again tomorrow night.

Yes you can hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.

Take heed, start doing things in reverse

All makes me glad of you
Though I am far away I am always with you

Drove her down to the river

Could never amount to betrayal

You looked at me for half a second
With an open invitation for me to go

Into temptation
Knowing full well the earth will rebel
Into temptation
Safe in the wide open arms of hell

We can go sailing in
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long
Into temptation
Right where you belong

The guilty get no sleep
In the last slow hours of morning

Sell your soul to the company
