Tessa,"Bring along your fishin' pole and leave your dirty dishes.
Meet me by the fishin' pole and wear your leather britches.
Tell your mom and pa everything's alright.
We're gonna go fishin' next Saturday night.
Lipstick, makeup, leave behind makeup, takes up too much time.
You're a little honey, and you're quite a dish.
But Saturday night we're goin' fishin', you fish.

Don't forget the frying pan and bring along some manners.
Gonna get your catfish and we'll cook 'em up for dinner.
Rollin' up, and fryin' up, and bakin' alright.
We're gonna go fishin' next Saturday night.

Never mind your powder puff, we're not goin' dancin'.

Tessa La,"Eres mi chico
A tu corta edad me haces tanta falta
Eres apuesto, tienes ternura
Y una carita con dulzura, eres muy bueno
En todo mi cuarto escribo tu nombre por todos lados
Tengo un mural, de fotos tuyas que me han regalado
Presumo mi hermoso bebe, que tanto he cuidado

Me encanta que me lleves dos veces por semana al cine
Que te quites tu chamarra, y me abrigues
Tenemos nuestra cueva de amor y la pasamos super
Nos conocemos, experimentamos
Se nos olvida como nos llamamos
Y nos amamos

Hermoso bebe
Mi niño de pestañas grandes
De ojos maravillosos, yo te cuidare
Hermoso bebe

Que del aire te protegiera, y ahí estaré

There's a time for love and a time for healing 
Can't go back and undo what's been done 
The word of mouth, time is revealing 
Just how far we've left this kingdom come 
Hand in hand we're finding our way 
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Kiss of life and the hand of fate 
Boy grows up into his father's son 
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate 
To carry on the way it had been done 
All our lives, it's debts to repay 
Maybe someday we can put the past away 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Put your fear away, find a better way 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Underneath a broken sky 
Love can heal the pain inside 
In a moment things can change 
One look behind and it's never the same",All Kinds of People,1991

I've been running from the truth 
I've been running since my youth, tired of running 
I will stand here till you see 
I am you and you are me, tired of running 
There really is no difference when you look beneath the skin 
Someday I know we'll go beyond this world we're living in 

Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Dancing in my dreams 

There's no hiding in the dark 
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder 
Just as long as we believe 
The truth will set us free, it's getting louder 
All that really matters is the light in your face 
In you I see the longing of the whole human race 

Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Dancing in my dreams 

On and on the story goes 
Or it's the passing of the torch 
With one small voice it all begins 
Then there are millions more, millions more",Dancing in My Dreams,1991
Tessa Niles,"The sun goes down
And the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you
And a mad thing starts
Ooooohhh-oooooohhh

Never in you wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking people talking
I smell your skin I feel you breathing
Don't let me go not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet

Never in your wildest dreams
Could you ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Did it ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

And the world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space

We've arrived at the place 
Where they open hearts
And fill them up with love
Filled with love filled with love
This on is pumping for you
As a mad thing starts

Never in your wildest dreams 
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams
",In Your Wildest Dreams,1991
Tessa Niles,"There was a time when I would have followed you 
To the end of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming you just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings

I see us in my dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on 
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why 
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways
On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away 
On silent wings

You never see it coming, but you know it has to end
Silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings

Let me tell you about a man I knew 
Yeah, I knew him all too well 

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight 
But not for tomorrow 
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford 
More than you can borrow 
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I 
Pick their pockets hey 
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train 
And make my getaway 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 

I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes 
Did something strange to me 
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride 
But there was a fork in the street 
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules 
That I've been taught 
You never get involved, never drop your defences 
But this time I got caught 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes 
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine 

Feels so good, I want more, it should be against the law",Thief of Hearts,1991

Tessa Souter,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

Alone on its own it will die
It eats what it needs to survive...

It wants to survive
Every night you look deep in your soul
Burn the fields
Where the the hatred is grown...

Hate...
Hate always seething to find
Some way to get to your brain
Infesting what's pure in the mind

Hatred divine...
Look around you is anyone pure
Free of hatred
Inside this cold world

Pre-conceived
Truth from lies
Blind to see
Through sewn shut eyes
Hate breeds hate

Hate...
Always eager to rise
Above all to gain full control
Infesting what's pure in the mind

Evil entwined...
Even now that the seeds have been sewn
Burn the fields
Where the hatred still grows...
Hate breeds hate

How many have die
Before we realize hate undermines

Hate...
Hate always eager to find
Some way to tear out your soul
Surviving the passage of time

Dirty white lies...
Back in time as our history shows
Endless cycless
Of hatred still flow

Pre-conceived heartless lies
Blind to see - through sewn shut eyes
Is there still hope for us now?
I said - is there still hope for us now?
NO!",Sewn Shut Eyes,1999
Testament,"I'm gonna take you to a place far from here
No one will see us
Watch the pain as it disappears

No time for anger
No time for despair
Won't you come with me
There's room for us there

This innocent beauty
My words can't describe
This rebirth to purity
Brings a sullen tear right to your eyes

No time for anger
No time for despair
Please let me take you
'Cause I'm already there

I'm so alone
My head's my home
I'll return to serenity

Rhyme without reason is why children cry
They see through the system
That's breeding them just so they die

C'en vaut la peine,

Mais chacun savait 
Qu'à Satan elle se confiait
En disant:

""Diminuée par moments
Mais à genoux jamais,
Je fascine le firmament,
Les étoiles sans filet""

""Vive la Nouvelle-Orleans,
Et le bayou d'antan
Les perles et le gombo""
Ainsi chantait, t'entends,
La Grande Marie Laveau.

Il y avait peu de vergogne,
Et du Congo chez Marie,
Des scandales, de la Bourgogne,
Et son pesant d'esprits.

Les fidèles ne s'y trompaient pas
Qui s'y réfugiaient la nuit,

""Quand l'infortune sonne le glas
La lune reconnaît ses héros,
Et quand en toi,il pleut tout bas,
Dehors il fait toujours beau...""

""Diminuée par moments
Mais à genoux jamais,
Je fascine le firmament,
Les étoiles sans filet""

""Vive la Nouvelle-Orleans,
Et le bayou d'antan
Les perles et le gombo""

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

¿a qué sabe el dolor? 
¿es eterno el amor? 
¿la amargura es mujer? 
¿de qué están hechos los sueños? 

¿cuánto pesa un adiós? 
¿por qué es muda la paz? 
¿puede dormir la traición?

Vive en ti, soy la voz dormida 
De los que el santo oficio

Volaremos sobre el arco iris
Donde mueren las penas 
Y nacen los besos en flor

Y a egipto morir
Y a jesús de nazaret
Expirar sin saber 

Que en su nombre iba a nacer

Traficantes de ilusión
Mercaderes de almas rotas

¿por qué es sorda la fe? 
¿y ciego el que cree? 
¿sabe un rezo besar? 
¿cuánto cobra el celibato? 

¿está en venta el altar? 
¿o lo alquiláis 
Para uso de un dictador? 
En uno hitler folló!

Donde mueren las penas 
Y nacen los besos en flor
Mi voz vive en ti

He bajado hasta tu infierno
Y a tus miedos pregunté 
¿dónde viven los fracasos? 
Y si aceptan un talón
He subido hasta su cielo
Su dios no me recibió
A su derecha esta franco 
Y entre los dos hay un hueco 
Para pinochet

Y verás que yo soy la voz dormida

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Just think how great the song would be 
And since the song is in freedom's key 
One voice you'd hear, so pure, so clear

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
The red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain, I gaze the sun doesn't shine
The rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see the west purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
The playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
Oh, is it cool? Is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me, I'm going to be, be with my baby
I am free, flying in her arms, over the sea
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites, with velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

The scarlett sweat
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon

Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe

When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Can I sit upon your bended knee just like the other man?
Didn't I die in Vietnam and didn't I walk in Birmingham?

Hear me, hear me

Didn't I sail the water against my every will?
Didn't I fetch that water when your bucket needed a refill?
Where was all the water when the fire was burning up the cross?
I'm your nephew too it's true, oh, hear me, Mr. Boss

Can you hear me, can you hear me? Listen to me

Didn't I get all A's in school, oh, yes I did now Uncle Sam
My books did not have covers on 'em still I did the best I can
How come I can't get no job, I just don't understand
Don't you love me anymore, why can't you tell me Uncle Sam

I'm your nephew, yes it's true, oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam
Can I sit upon your bended knee just like the other man?
Didn't I die in Vietnam and didn't I walk in Birmingham?
I'm your nephew, yes it's true, oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam

I've lived the life a citizen's supposed to
So why I gotta be the illegitimate nephew
Remember me, Uncle Sam I fought your war
And went all out not knowing what I was fighting for

Sam why'd you let them rape my great grandmother?
Then go to the oak tree and hang her brother
When Abe was slaving there wasn't a fuss
So where was you when they was in my yard burning the cross?

Do you love me or what, Uncle Sam, what is it?
You wanna maim me and claim the grand wizard
I'll let that pass and marched for a just 'cause
Then got uncivilized rights with unenforced laws

Passed your curriculum got a diploma
And can't get a job 'cause my skin has color
You say things changed between now and then
Now, I wanna know the difference between me and him?

I'm your nephew, yes it's true, oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam
Can I sit upon your bended knee just like the other man?
Didn't I die in Vietnam and didn't I walk in Birmingham?
I'm your nephew, yes it's true, oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam

Can't you hear me Uncle Sam
Can't you hear me Uncle Sam

I'm your nephew, yes it's true , oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam
Can I sit upon your bended

Livin' all their lives waitin' in the wings

Gonna break every rule I'll bend them all out of shape

Into my life and now you're all I dream

And no matter how hopeless and no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
Then my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
Yeah, yes
Oh yeah

And the world will be better for thee
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
Mmm-hmmm, star, mmm...

You captured this heart of mine
Lying in a field full of dandelions

You are my life
You're my sunshine
A beautiful flower
Wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion

While I was lying in the autumn breeze
I felt a brush against my skin
So elegantly free
So delicate was she
And something deep within was calling out to me

Where have you been?
I've waited patiently
I never thought you'd find your way
Her voice so heavenly

Dear God
I can't believe
An angel sent to me
Don't ever go away

Lying in a field full of dandelions

I picked a petal just to taste and see
Oh, how sweet your love could really be
Then all the honeybees would surely envy me
Don't let this fantasy become a memory

I'll be the rain that falls upon you
Let me be your morning dew
I'll be the breeze embracing you

I'll be the sun that shines so brightly
On the darker side of you
Throughout the night
I'll be your guiding light
The star that's watching you

You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos

Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game

He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand

On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them

He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock

Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner

The elevation of a people built is so

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

Get your favorite one to sit by your side
Cuddle up in a sleigh

And away we go.

While you listen to the sleigh bells ring
You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm
no matter how cold it may be

Take a look at little Jack and Jill
They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill
It's a thrill that I can't forget

It Happened In Sun Valley not so very long ago
There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgment morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale (like a silvery veil)
It's time to climb into my saddle

And ride the Navajo Trail

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven 
Oh what a beautiful sight 


Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven. And you know who greeted 
me at the gate? The ole cowboy-philosopher himself, Will Rogers. He said 
to me, he said ""Tex, the Big Boss of the riders up here has asked me to 
kinda show you around. Now, over yonder are a couple of your ole 
compadres 


."" My, was I glad to see them, Carson Robison and the 
Mississippi blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers. 

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven 
Oh what a beautiful sight 

He introduced me to Wiley Post, and he showed me the Hall of Fame with 
all the gold guitars and fiddles hanging on the walls. Then he said, 
""Tex, step over this way, there are two more of your friends I know 
you'll want to see, they're waitin' for you."" There they were standin' 
side by side and smilin' at me--Hank Williams and Johnny Horton. 


I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven 
Oh what a star-studded night 

Then I asked him who else do you expect in the next, uh, say a hundred 
years? He handed me a large book covered with star dust. Will called it 
the Big Tally Book. In it were many names and each name was branded in 
pure gold. I began to read some of them as I turned the pages: Red Foley, 
Ernest Tubb, Gene Autry, Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Tennessee Ernie, Jimmy 
Dean, Andy Griffith, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter

You see, I ain't got no more outlaws to break
But I'll buy you a ticket and I'll give you a stake.
At ridin' them bad ones, well, you ain't slow
And you might do some good at the big rodeo.

While they're puttin' the bull in the chute
I'm a strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
I looks that bull over and to my suprise
Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes
On top of his shoulders he's got a big hump
I cinch's my riggin' just back of that lump
I latch in his middle and I lets out a scream
He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream.

Well he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
But I ain't no green horn - I'm still sittin' tight
The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin
He's a wavin' them horns right under my chin
At sunnin' his belly he couldn't be beat
He's showin' the buzzards the soles of his feet
He's a dippin' so low that my boots filled with dirt
He's a makin' a whip of the tail of my shirt.

He's snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes
He's a buckin' and a bawlin' and a blowin' his nose
The crowd starts to cheerin' both me and that bull
Well, he needed no help, but I had my hands full
Then he went to fence rowin' and a weavin behind
My head went poppin' - I sorta went blind
He starts in high divin' - I lets out a groan
We went up together, but he come back alone.

Up high I turns over and below I can see
He's a pawin' up dirt just a waitin' for me
I can picture a grave and a big slab of wood
Sayin', ""Here lies a twister who thought he was good.""
I notice this somethin' don't seem can be true
But the brand on his hip was a big Flyin' U
When I landed he charged, but I got enough sense
So I ran that old bull to the hole in the fence.

Tex Ritter,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, 
As I walked out in Laredo one day, 
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen, 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Singy the Death March as you carry me along. 
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, 
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."" 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by. 
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story; 
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!"" 

""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water 
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said. 
Before I returned his spirit had left him 
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead. 

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",Streets of Laredo,1974
Tex Ritter,"Friends, this is Tex Ritter with a strange story about a soldier boy and
a deck of cards. During a North African campaign a bunch of soldier boys
had been on a long hike, and they arrived in a little town called
Casino.""

The next morning being Sunday several of the boys went to church. A
Sargent commanded the boys in church, and after the Chaplain had read the
prayer the text was taken up next..Those of the boys who had a prayer book
took them out, but this one boy only had a deck of cards, and so he spread
them out.

The Sergeant saw the cards and said,""Soldier, put away those cards.""

After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said, ""Sargent, why have you brought this man here?""

""For playing cards in church, sir.""

""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""

""Much, sir."" replied the soldier.

'The Marshall said, ""I hope so, for if not , I shall punish you more than
any man was ever punished.""

The soldier said, ""Sir , I have been on a march for about six days, and I had neither Bible nor Prayer Book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.""

With that the boy started his story.

""You see, Sir, when I look at the Ace it reminds me that there is but one God. The deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts; the Old and New Testaments. And when I see the trey I think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When I see the four I think of the four evangelist who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. Ten of 'em; five who were wise and were saved; five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it
reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when
I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His
great work. When I see the eight I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife,their three sons, and their wives. And when I see the nine I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed , and nine of the ten didn't even thank Him.  When I see the ten I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone. When I see the King it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the queen I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary who is Queen of Heaven. And the jacks, or knaves, it's the devil. And when I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find three hundred sixty-five the number of days in a year.   Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. Four suits, the number of weeks in a month. Twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.  Thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serve me as a Bible, almanac, and prayer book.""

He looked at his watch and his watch was slow
He turned to his frieman and this is what he said
""Boy, we're going to reach Frisco, but we'll all be dead""
He turned to the fireman, said ""Shovel on your coal
Stick your head out the window, see the drivers roll
I'm gonna drive her til she leaves the rail
For I'm eight hours late by that Western Mail""

When he pulled up that Reno hill
He whistled for the crossing with an awful shrill
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
When he was within six miles of the place
There No. 4 stared him straight in the face
He turned to his fireman, sai ""Jim, you'd better jump
For there're two locomotives that are going to bump.

Casey Jones, two locomotives
Casey Jones, going to bump


Casey said just before he died
""There're two more roads I would like to ride""
The fireman said ""Which ones can they be?""
""O the Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe""

Just to hear the news that her Casey was dying

""Single Rooms For Single Girls No Men Allowed"" it said
But rumor had it that a gentleman with a yen for love for a fee
Could always go to Nancy Ann's for some feminine company
Well one night in June in the billiard room was I chalking up with a friend
He was set to break when the door burst open and Leo James rushed in
He yelled there's a fire that's just broke out and it's down at Nancy Ann's
So we dropped our cues on the poolroom floor and down the street we ran
Though the flames were hot and the smoke was thick not a single life was lost
And the reason for the blaze was never found
But it long will be remembered in our local history
As the fire that fairly scandalized the town
The night Miss Nancy Ann's Hotel For Single Girls burned down
When we got to the place the front was a blaze and so was the second floor
So we cut around the side and up the alley and stopped aside the back door
We were catching our breath when the door flew open and knocked poor Leo flat
And out through the smoke ran Mayor Wills wearin' nothing but a black silk hat
And right behind him with his shirt tail afire came the local chief of police
And banker Jones with the red-haired girl he always said was his niece
And then I spied Miss Nancy Ann herself helping someone else out of the fire
Her arm around the red bald head of old Judge McEntire
A deacon a dentist a deputy sheriff and one state congressman
The county physician the city mortician out through the flames they ran
The grand parade of girls in gowns and hat clad gentlemen
Through the thick gray smoke that certainly smelled like french perfume and gin
Though the flames were hot...
Now everybody was out at the girl's hotel by the time the roof caved in
We were headin' back to the billiard hall when Leo turned to my friend

And every dream I have on earth is sleepin' too
Oh Lord she looks pretty in blue

My sleepin' beauty lay with folded hands
So the world could see her golden weddin' band

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1991

"Tex, Don & Charlie","Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

"Tex, Don & Charlie","Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

I knew I couldn’t stand it alone

Aah, I know I’m special inside
And how I gave you all of my life

Than your touch and here we go

It's never what you wanna hear
It's funny how much words can hurt you
Even after all these years
I wanna make an observation
'Bout how you tear your world apart
And every time I try to tell you
You blame it on your fickle heart

How they're hurting you
When they're not deserving you
Are so, are so afraid of you

Give it up,
I'm never gonna hold you up
You've always been afraid of love

Waking up is never easy
So why don't you come over here
Tell me 'bout the dreams that haunt you
Tell me 'bout your secret fears
I wanna change your whole perseption
If only I could make you see
How it's all your own creation
That's bringing you this misery

How they're hurting you
When they're not deserving you
Are so, are so afraid of you

Give it up,
I'm never gonna hold you up
You've always been afraid of love

Were never said, were never said
The heart you break, you mistake
For me instead, for me instead
