Hear that knocking in your soul
No, you don't listen
Can you hear that knocking 
Overload
No, you don't listen
Never see the high beyond the low
No wonder, you lay 
Twitching
Do you share the rush to be alone
Come over, we'll go missing
We'll go where 
There's no snow
We'll go and they won't know
Just please don't give me your word
Do

Delays,"No I don't think it's a good thing,

Without a second thought you put your hand on my shoulder,
Without a second look you took me miles away,
What happened after that, I couldn't see and I lost you?
And I stumbled around until I found you again,

Cos' you are my only hideaway, you make the world seem bigger,
You are my only hideaway, you do,

Without a second thought you found the words to explain me,
Without a second look you tried to open my mind,
Well I know that you are waiting and your patience is failing,
But I know that I'll get there in a matter of time,

Cos' you are my only hideaway, you make the world seem bigger,
Oh you are my only hideaway, you do,

And so tonight we'll set the motion right,
And so tonight, we've time to make it alright,",Hideaway,2006

Delays,"I can see a hurricane tonight
It keeps me from my valentine
This voodoo's doing me harm
Woo (woo), woo (woo), racing along

But maybe this is the moment to pray, dear
But I'd rather lay by your side
'Cause millions are fighting their way here

Tell me...when did the water surround me?
And tell me...is that love in your eyes?

New Orleans will tremble tonight
With bleeding hearts and swaying lights
A very modern machine
Woo (woo), woo (woo), it's coming for me

Yeah, maybe this is the moment to say, dear
That I thought I'd have you by now
But sentiment got in the way, dear

Tell me...when did the water surround me?
And tell me...is that love in your eyes?
And tell me...when did the water surround me?
And tell me...is that, is that love?

And tell me...our last night on Earth is for living
And tell me...is that, is that love?

Delays,"To the bitter end I have fought alone
Now this cavalry is coming home

Like a motorcade lost in ticker-tape

On any other day there'd be a marching band

What say we go, meet by the well?
Don't tell a soul, this is our time

And we can lay low tonight
No, I don't have the will to fight

You and me could've been fine, you an me were gonna be fine

Beside
There's nothing like a friend to throw you out of time

I can't drive but I'm learning to arrive without
Damaging the exit sign

From the deep

But my head spins the opposite way to the sky
Can't sit down

Think I've run out of luck

Last night I was trying to think of your name
But my head was still clouded and you were to blame
Where are you?
Huh?
Where were you?

But what are the chances of you going nowhere?
And what are the chances of making you cry?

Delbert McClinton,"Caught a ride in South Dakota
With two girls in a light blue Desoto
One's names was Jane
The other was plain
But they both had racing motors

Next I caught a ride with a gamblers wife
She had a brand new laid down Rambler
She parked outside of town
And laid the rambler down
And said she sure could dig it if I rode her

I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing' I'd rather do
Look for me someday
I'm gonna be there, honey
With something special just for you

At a truck stop for toothpick and water
Caught a ride with a fruit picker's daughter
We drove into the night
Said 'The fruit's just right'
She said all I could eat for a quarter

Next I caught a ride with a hobo woman
Who said she was from Texas too
The way she did what she did
When she did, what she did to me
Made me think of you

Bet all my money on a race horse baby
One they said can't lose
Now I'm down here in the pouring rain
Trying to get to you, Trying to get to you

And I'm walking and I'm talking to myself
And it's raining and I'm freezing to death
Trying to get to you, trying to get to you

Delbert McClinton,"Your clothes and your pictures that has made you live
In that little dream house you once shared with me
My heart is as empty as where our house used to be
You see I just burned a dream you once shared with me

I searched for the answer but all that I found
Was to just light a match and burnt it to the ground
So when they come for me like I know they'll do
So I just burned a dream what else could I do

I searched for the answer but all that I found
Was to just light a match and burnt it to the ground
So when they come for me like I know they'll do

",Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday,1972
Delbert McClinton,"You promised a new world
You showed me and made me believe it did exist
And now you pretend you don't know me
And you say that world was a mess

I woke up and the world was gone
And I never felt so all alone
It was cold and dark without a dawn
When I woke up and the world was gone

That world you promised, you gave me honey
I was there every time we kissed
And when your world had enslaved me
That world you promised went a mist

I woke up and the world was gone
And I never felt so all alone
It was cold and dark without a dawn
When I woke up and the world was gone

",I Received a Letter,1972
Delbert McClinton,"You stole the one I loved, ain't that true?
But I hear someone just did the same to you
She left you flat without a reason why
Well, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy

It couldn't happen to a nicer guy
You've got what you deserved, I'm not surprised
I hear you've been seen around with tears in your eyes
Well, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy

You lost just what you stole, ain't that true?
You had it just long enough to catch the blues
I hear you've been rewarded her goodbye
Well, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy

It couldn't happen to a nicer guy
You've got what you deserved, I'm not surprised
I hear you've been seen around with tears in your eyes
Well, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy

Delbert McClinton,"All of me belongs to you all the time
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's not one way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you

Eyes are worthless cause you're not here to see
Lips are so forgotten since you forgotten me
My arms ached from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you

Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
Not one single part of me that my heart don't include
All of me belongs to you, all of me belongs to you

She laid a kiss on me hotter than a brandin' iron
She came on tough, she came on strong
She calf-tied my soul, now I can't leave her alone

When she told me to buck, I buck
When to move, I move
When she told me to jump, I jump
When to woo, I woo
She dug her spurs into my mind and rode me to the ground
If I had the will or strength, I'd crawl outta town

I love that, love, love, love, love rustler
I love the, love, love, love, love, love rustler

Let me up
I got to get outta here

Let me up
I got to get outta here

Let me up
I got to get outta here

And no holes in your walkin' shoes

Is a fertile place to plant the seed now

Be prepared to dial 911

And stay away from the man with a gun

Make sure your clock has a snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover

Confessions heard, forgiveness given from twelve o'clock 'til two

But her broken wings still have the strength to hold you when you cry

The day that you left, I promised myself
That I was gonna be just fine

but I have learnt

as long as you are true
to the life that you live
it is the time to feel love
I feel a stirring deep within

Slowly picking up momentum
Like the tide coming to shore
Over and under in it's course
This feeling emblazed inside
Every nerve like a firefly

Hovering above me, glowing
Glow glowing glowing divine
Every nerve like a firefly
every nerve like a firefly
This feeling emblazoned inside
Every nerve like a firefly

I never want to loose
what I have finally found
there's a requiem a new congregation
and it's telling me go forward
and walk under a brighter sky

every nerve glowing like a firefly
glowing divine
every nerve like a firefly

Delerium,"To others the pain was obvious The colours of shame a bruise -
Unjust
Abuse of trust can't be wiped
I can't remember why I chose to say goodbye I'm terrified of
What I
Might have severed
I tried to forget the drowning truth Lashing inside my sea of

Youth
Life seemed a fair sacrifice for peace
I can't remember why I chose to say goodbye I'm terrified of
What I
Might have severed
I ended up too high But never learnt to fly
So coming down I'm very thankful (you were there)",Wisdom,1997
Delerium,"Bleak desolation In a beam of Sun Scraping as I crawl (Your heart can't hear me)
Tearing bruising fall (Your hands can't hear me)
Thirsting raging blind (Your eyes can't hear me)
Racing against time (Your arms can't hear me)

Like an angel you'll come In a dream, precious one (And) Make me beautifully numb
Desperate panicked calls (The wind can't hear me)
Muffled weak and small (The sand can't hear me)
Pleading, groping hands (The truth can't hear me)

Bleeding in the sand (Your heart can't hear me)
Bleak desolation In a beam of sun Like an angel you'll come in a dream, blessed one (And)
Make me joyfully numb
Razor fingers cling (The wind can't hear me)

Piercing demons sing (The sand can't hear me)
Twisting hollow Hell (The truth can't hear me)
Burning blisters swell (Your heart can't hear me)
Sharp cut aching breath (Your arms can't hear me)

Choking scent of death (Your hands can't hear me)
Gruelling jaw-bone grind (Your eyes can't hear me)
Cursed by my own mind (Your heart can't hear me)

Interrupted life again, another new beginning
Where the silence echoes
You're no longer with me

I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone
But that's okay

Through the darkness 
I would walk in the streets
Confessions never seemed
To provide me with a release
Held me down and tried to cure me
Tried to give me reason
But nothing could sepearate
This burdened mind from me

Here and now
I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
Looking out to a different sky will disengage me
Absence is never the answer, I know
But it serves as my shade

I do not seek and not intend to find
A calmer ocean or a sun that'll never rise
My world will never change
And time will bring you to my thoughts
I'll move on and forget you all over again
Moving on, I can forgive you all over again

Here and now
I feel that I'm embracing freedom

ma non tutti vivono un incubo

piccoli come un microbo

abbiam bisogno di aiuto
vieni a darcelo

ma credono a ciò che fai

e tu hai scelto la pistola

fuori per la strada
o dentro un buco immondo

grate alle finestre

Mi scivola tutto addosso

A me non mi fotte un cazzo, come una lesbica
I fratelli miei ti fottono per soldi tipo Yespica
Non me ne fotte un cazzo se c'è il sole oppure nevica
Ho una tipa sudamerica non una bianca anemica
Freddo tipo Artic
Qui se cadi non ti aiutano a rialzarti
Ma ti sputano e calpestano I tuoi arti
Freddo come sul mio polso casse Oyster vetri zaffiri
Che penso a trasformare questi euri in franchi svizzeri
Me ne fotto della vita della morte dei miracoli
Ai posteri, lascerò I miei postumi
Non mi chiedete del rap sono la persona sbagliata
Perché mi fate cagare come la coca tagliata

Ma con me ha urlato tipo il primo schiaffo dell'ostetrica
Resto tranquillo mentre mi minacci, isterica
Sulla mia c'è scritto Desert Eagle sulla tua c'è ""replica""
Vedi fra la vendetta va servita fredda
Ma visto che è un detto uno se l'aspetta e l'ho servita tiepida
Se metto il turbo tipo Porche 911
Fra viene giù tutto tipo in USA il 9.11
Se sembro americano chiama il 911

Per uno 0, 7
Uno 007

Mi viene a casa e trova zero sempre

Mi scivola tutto addosso Un cuore duro come pietra
Dritto fino alla meta
Non credo alla tua verità
La storia la riscrivo da solo
Brillo come la cometa
Brindando a chi con me sta
Sulla mia strada corro e non mi volto mai Tanto sai già come finirà

Ran out the door, and into the parking lot
Gunned the engine of his '59 Chevrolet Apache truck
Left a little rubber at Sears & Roebuck
Down-shifted, passed a Camaro, made a left at the light
Headed down the boulevard headed for Friday night

Pocketful of diamonds, a pocketful of diamonds
And wings on both of my heels
Close your eyes, make a wish, count on up to three
Open them up now can't you see
All I've got is all you need

Hit the brakes up on the curb leaned into the horn
Mary shouted I'll be right down from the window on the second floor
Her momma yelled, ""Get home early, I don't care if it's Friday night""
She ran down the walk laughing, ""We'll be home before it's light""
Headed out to the Palomino, best jukebox around
To forget about the last five days and get a little loud

Pocketful of diamonds, a pocketful of diamonds
And wings on both of my heels
Close your eyes, make a wish, count on up to three
Open them up now can't you see
All I've got is all you need

Reached in his pocket, he pulled out a handful of lint
Laughed right out loud as he tossed it into the wind
Up above in the sky strings of party lights
Old Hank Ballard, bless his soul, made them dance night
Ain't it funny, what a lark how far you can go
When you've got a pocketful of diamonds the world is made of gold

But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter

Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'

Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places

Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show

come sit next to me you fine fellow.""

Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play

Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are

So a brother with the money can be their man

He's hopin' you can make it there if you can

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really fine cause the girl is stacked

Feelin' downtrodden
Fresh kid turned rotten
I can't believe I'm like E then I'm cotton
Over the years seems like I'm gettin' dumber
Reminiscing to a time when I was younger with a hunger
Full a dreams, determination, self-esteem 
But now it seems they hesitate to be on my team
You know the routine, when you winnin' and grinnin'
All up in your face, like they was wi'ch you from the beginnin'
But on the flipside,
When you washed up like a riptide
Fools clown 'bout how you slipped and let shit slide
Beside the fact
My voice is wack
Clowns is runnin' around, talkin' 'bout I smoke crack
Ain't got no homies that got my back
Yeah I'm a brotha, but some times I don't feel black
My girl is white
My game idn't tight		
Niggas who ain't seen me in a while be like ""Dude, you aight?""

Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'

But naw, I'm just a bitch ass nigga
The type that get jacked above the ribs ass nigga
See I been a loser just about all my life
Type that try turn a ho to a housewife
What do you expect
I give respect
And feel for hoes niggas keep in check
I'm far from hard
Emotionally scarred
On Pico Boulevard
I was regarded as a retard
I make myself sick

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Wild thing

Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""

So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine

Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance

So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Delight,"I feel so unsure,
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies...
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

[CHORUS:]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have done my rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better then to cheat a friend,
And waste a chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again.
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend.
To the heart and mind
If your answer's kind...
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you find.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
What am I without your love?
Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way
We've hurt each other with the things we want to say.
We could have been so good together
We could have lived forever...
But no, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.

Now that you're gone...
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?",Careless Whisper,
Delight,"He was the first of us
He did it with a Bible in one hand
After that quiet funeral
We were drinking wine on his grave

[Chorus]
Now I'm here because I want it
And I'll be gone someday
Courting with my destiny
There's always a reason to die

People were asking why
When he hanged himself next door somehow
I don't remember his face
He always ran down stairs too fast

Oh we cannot change the fate
It's the another face of the death
There's no one to blame
The only thing I please is a peaceful death

She called me for the last time
And it was a strange goodbye
Now we still cannot believe
That she really she really passed away

You always seem to keep me so irate
Make me wait for you

Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
I've often wondered how long it's gonna take me
In this world until the good Lord shake me
And to the man I put up with mad sorrow
But I learned soon the sun still shines tomorrow
Sometimes bad thoughts they brought me down
Growin up hard livin' poor side of town
Cause where I was I wondered who will ever need me?
But now I know that much love flew freely
My momma my poppa both took care
No matter what I did I knew they would be there
Ball in the school yard puppy love crushes
Mischief in the nightime with intimate touches
Playin' with the females Christmas was cool
Didn't have much but had enough fool
So here's three cheers beers up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
So if you think all of your life was bad
Reminisce on all the good times you had

[Verse 2]
Well it was once upon a time in the seventies a baby boy bounces
Placed on this earth wayin' seven and some ounces
But that wasn't all of the bouncin'
It was hard for mom to try to keep the proper housin'
Straight from Gardena before my sista Linda
Migrated to the East Side projects Maravilla
There I had my stroll on Rigin' Elementary
Moms a quarter century pop left us on empty
But that was nothin' new though packin up our shit so
We could make the move Cudahay was the zip code
Moms working fingers to the bone just to make ends meat
I was a latch key delinquent daily runnin' the street
And every time I look back I think of just anotha challenge
Holidays and birthdays grim still I managed
To key a smile making life fun
And how can I forget about the seasons in the sun?
So here's three cheers beer up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]",Good Times,1996
Delinquent Habits,"Come on, man, give me a dime
I got fienders for flavours of beats and rhymes
My brains gettin’ heavy, I feel mad rejection
I feel the rushin’ of your funk injection
So let me all have it all shit that’s funky
And let me get to tweakin’ off this here chumpy
Drink up a cup of the distilled funk
It ain’t aged 12 years but it’s potent, punk
I ain’t passed out yet, I can’t stop but I’m close
To the 12-bore sureshot overdose
You see my heart palpitations pound with no limit
Another round comes down, I’m all up in it

I’m addicted, I’m a junkie
That’s why I got to fiendin’ for the shit that’s funky
I’m addicted, I’m a junkie
That’s why I got to fiendin’ for the shit that’s funky

I’m just a addict addicted

Can ya please o.g. give me just another hit
Please o.g. I fiend ya for the funky shit
Bring it on now and let me rip the microphone
Wit’ the new style and make it funky to the bone now
Let me back up in this
I need another fix, I’m knockin’ doors off hinges
Coz I’m the type I have to take it all no strain
Just load it up and drop the beat now please inject my vein
There’s a chemical breakdown and balanced reaction
And I ain’t gettin’ down with just a portion of the fraction of the funk
No joke, I need it all, indeed
Now warm it up and line it up so I can feed my greed

I'm just a little bolder than your average soldier
Staring at you psycho hey what's a huero loco?
Twisted out mental mad whacked in the coco
Never givin' up I got wisdom persistence
Two clips loaded in a glock for resistance
A flock of delinquentes steppin' through the silence
Mellow type of fellow still poised for the violence

The charges won't stick I wonder when these people gonna get
The fuck up off my dick there's nowhere you could ever take a drag boy

And let your joint blaze smoke up and get a little higher
If the cherry goes out then relight the fire
Pump it up and do this swing for mine baby
Ives in the party ya'll time to get crazy
Swing it left swing it right swing it back and to the front ha
No takin' or the fakin' cause we givin' what you want ha
Pure bread born and raised the underground system
My recipes so ill you'll think I'm crazy if I list em
So I choose to freak it from the dawn till the light
To let you listen' hard to what it be like

What it really be like what it be like
What it be like tell me what it be like
Do you know what it be like cause I know what it be like

You won't be saying shit after I sock you in the frente
So what's it gonna be sucka what it be like?
As I descend from the trend every muthafuckin' night
And so I gotta keep the rhymes kinda funky you know
I'm still rollin' in the jacked up Chevy '64
You need to ease back sucka you need to pipe down
Delinquent type of hound is what you're gettin' from the realm
When I'm steppin' through the fog my dogs are kinda fatal
I'll swat you like a fly that's on my kitchen table
If another day ends still a new dawn breaks
And once again I'm droppin' shit upon this 2 inch tape

Over hip-hop chords
The Lower EastSide allow me kick the funk no fraud
See it's the third time for the Ives my news flash
No matter what I'm still gonna be the poor white trash
Diggin up and out the ghetto
Hard raised and rockin'
From backspinnin' from freakin' the beat and pop-lockin'
From early days I'm steppin' to battle like a vulture

Bass gets to pumpin' rucka's get to pumpin'
Who's that rap king got the party start jumpin'
Blasting too high no need for the boo-ya
My hammer with the one knock I'll shoot through ya
Step to the crowd I feel the strain
Those chingazos in the moshpit feel for pain
So don't get in my way baby
Because the guero loco came in here to play baby
My shit'll pump up a jam, god damn its the baddest

Si me tries bronca, me aloco de a tiro
Me paro te tumbo, no es tu rumbo
Why con en lingo talvez te confundo

The blaxican once again with the cocktail pin
As I emerge from the depths of the realm my son
I got the black gat fat track, coke to rum
Otra vez ya lo ves in the crew somos tres.
One blaxican on the squad you don't test
Sittin' hard like and an Aztec swift like a Zooloo
That's what it's like when the pump shot through ya
My manner is the mildest till the punks get piled
My number one assassin flips the mad funk styles
Me I play the back road but I'm delinquente
This is how I freak it when I'm speakin' to the gente

Freak it, pump it, bass out the carro

One turntable and a broken 808, uh-uh

",It's the Delinquentes,1998
Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
I see them punk putos they coolin' by the lockers
Sellin' crystal to their women fine freaks turned flaca
Your lady say she love you but you locked inside
I heard you slipped they caught you rollin' with some dope in your ride
Your lady said she'll wait love don't come cheap
She'd rather see in the pinta than six feet deep
But can't she see that in the pinta you're a soldier
They take ya break ya make ya and mold ya
Turn you into somethin' way loco hard
Surviving scraps and jacks earning your stripes on the yard
Every night thinking about the good ol days
Look at the picture of your ruca on the wall and pray say
Por favor perdon a pecado won't you come into and save me why sabes que I'm feelin' hollow
So look into your saviors eyes and see tears
Shed for you loco and all these years

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for the vato locked down and then
I shed a tear for his girl waitin' to see him again
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die

[Verse 2]
Freakas of the funk yo it's the funk freakas
The dog's out the yard and he's loud in your speakas
Stompin' with my compas or should I say my back up
Crusing in the Impala countin' feria that we stacked up
Delinquents pick the slack up I be the first to act up
Deal with all these puntos but first I fuck the track up
Do what I got to do in the quest for the paper
I don't give a fuck if it puts me in danger
Dealin' with the anger that everyone has
Sometimes it makes me feel like a psychopath
I put it on tape and you know I won't lie
I'll be down with the Habits even after I die

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for you vatos won't you change your ways
I shed a tear for you vatos in these last days
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die

[Verse 3]
There must be 50 ways to break it down ya'll
There must be 50 ways to let you know
But now they come like what's up muthafuckas it's best to move back
Click clack goes the cuete snap goes the neck
From your canton right up to my canton
It seems that everybody want to be el mas chingon
We move alone or in packas collect ferria in stockas
We got no love for them ratas chest flesh full of placas
And would you strike me down will I feel the wrath
To protect my own another's life is lost in the aftermath
No indecisions mind state makin' moves with precision
See the good turn bad and confirm that I'm livin'
Between Heaven and Hell this be the gloomy old West
Where many souls get lost and many more lie to rest

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for the vatos in street that's dyin'
I shed a tear for the mamas that's at home cryin'
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die",Shed a Tear,1998
Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
It's time to amount an enormous amount of muscle
Move in like 5th batalian while woofers gonna bring trouble
Que quieres a mia moving to make me a little somethin'
Won't catch me chasin' the dragon adrenelin got me pumpin'
Stop take a breath collect my thoughts
Release defenses and check senses
Pull jacks in dope spots
Puff boom muthafucka I swirve and hit the center
Hit it silver star style while others afraid to enter
Bravery in the battle homes I ain't no doubt
We stand alone usually we left the third click out
That's why we moved on cause mental spirits was gettin' broken
By some leech muthafuckas best kill em because we chokin'
Send a heat seeker to take a section of the industry
Not paranoia you really think they feelin' me?
I cut their finger from hand and cut their hand from wrist shit
Light another joint time to get lit

[Chorus 8X]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans

[Verse 2]
Now everybody checkin' the lingo you know I bringo
(Strong arm tactics) represento fresco raw through the weso
why digo trucha con tususia cuando entro con el latin lingo
Collecting masa across the map like Desperado steelo
Now you can bust and I can bust but
Who got that gold in they clutch?
And I'm tremendo cuando prendo lenos down to the crutch
So if we hittin' la botella then let's gulp it all down
And if we hittin' yerba buena then let's smoke the whole pound
The LowerEast is back up in this muthakilla for realla
Los Delinquentes rifan todo Sur Califa I figure
My DNA is everlasting

Somebody's knockin' on the door somebody's ringin' the bell
Somebody's knockin' on the door and we got em all scared as hell
But you ain't gotta open up still I bust through
Like a Mac truck rollin' over them guts
En la back of la traila you know I got mis amigos
Los camaradas to these Lower EastSide Angelinos
Mis perros mi guardan
Muerden know ladran feel a seizure coming on if I sick em on ya
Soy Blaxicano Latino El Pistolero
Snatch a crown off the king and wipe it all on my huevos
Ankles I bust you best invest in a brace
I'm makin' moves shake and bake and then I eat the whole plate
I'm psyclone like a dog for his bone you take a piece of my pie
Well then it's on why va star cabrone
Cause when you're fuckingg with the bull it's the horns you get
I gotta pierce that epidermis when I go for your neck
(And I'm serio) a no lo crees pendejo te dejo
Patadon a los huevos cacheton a lo sesos

It's mi costa the West is reclaimed by this critical acclaimed
Underated still I wreck your main frame
It's mi costa wallah don't make a sah
I'm about to put it on ya I came I'm gonna

[Verse 2]
I'm tense nervous about my inside feelin'
But I still keep muthafuckas dancin' on the ceilin'
Watch the smoke rise Ives burned but still I
Floss Delinquente compound the real high
Fuego to leno leno to boca
Bird finger flippin' trippin' off the chota
Smooth with the west wind chest plate to vest in
I smoke a toke of mari to my chest in
I ain't violent mira I'm just a stoner
Rockin' Lower EastSide sunny Southern California
Flows start to rockin' if shit gets to poppin'
Bloody knuckle style moppin' if teeth get to droppin'
You could keep the style rockin with breakin' or loose lockin'
Even if the pigs come knockin' we won't be stoppin'

Chale me vale madre you fuck around I'll pull a hale

So sit back relax put on your head gear
Let me work this beat like an offic-ier

Underrated still I wreck your main frame
I be that one huero loco psyclone in la mente
Claimin el tereno feelin muy excelente
See last year I took it straight up to your frente
To penetrate your coco flexin con el huero loco
Back up on the scene to smash your pipe dream
You can run but you can't hide when my sac swings
See it's the pendulum cuttin' baby shake their but and
In fact tell you somethin' fool you ain't nothin'

Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
Book me a flight to 30 cities round this land
Give me a fat sack of weed and some cash in hand
Some vatos that can handle themselves out on the road
And I guaran-damn-tee you the spot will explode
I want to rock Sur Califa Midwest known to deliver
Gettin stoned lookin' out over the Hudson River
See we poppin' worldwide West to East
Anywhere there's stomach acid in the belly of the beast
Where teeth is grittin' rundown but still hittin'
In their rides top tippin' with my cut straight dippin'
Be the type to leave you dazed out blowin' snot bubbles
Like a late-night bud binge face down in the puddle
If there's one thing I've learned in my travels that's ironic
We all the same it's just we smoked different chronic
We are carnales homes it's like you didn't know
You're the reason I came I think it's time to flow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've been around in the game much longer than you can figure
All across the map to keep my pocket book bigger
The late-night binges the all-night party
Daily gettin' twisted off the herb and Bacardi
Rollin with my homeboys but they more like family
Started in the West now to the East is where they're flyin' me
A first class ticket we flyin' overseas
Crossing the Atlantic feeling Germany's breeze
Pissin' in the snow right down beside the Autobon
Shook the spot in Hamburg ended up in Amsterdam
Hit the skies again back home to my Califas
A little champagne the huero's high off the reefa
Let's take a little trip down south of the border
Chillin' con mis compas tequila is in order
That's how it goes now I'm headed back home
Livin' on the road till my record sells gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No matter how you see it now it's quite the same
You can tour with or for that platinum fame
I give a damn about the fame homeboy now you can keep that
I tour for the crema the masa the fucking straight cash
Fame don't pay the bills that's on the real
Only cash from my rola with that mass appeal
I got all y'all in my sights tonite
You should be pumpin' like a hydro if all goes right
I plan to rock my funky rolas from the gates of California
Jams like a bug-a-boo all up on ya
Passin' entrance aw you know
I can't fight it yo I think it's time we go...

[Chorus]",Western Ways,1998
Delinquent Habits,"Now here's a little city that's about 3 miles
Outside of everybody's outskirts and principal
This here's a place where all our minds get spent
Self-destruction meet a quota take a trip get bent
Take a head trip outta hookah puff for days fuck a hurra
Take a chair drink a shoota brain boilin' off the Buddha
Bring on the dancin' girls with long curls
Interlaced with lotus blossoms of pink purple and pearl
Enjoy your feast of drink and slaughtered beast
On marble with linen creased and pieced with gold leaf
Your mood enhanced with wine song and dance 
And story of ancient bands with horns out they hands and
Ain't no doubt about it they let you puff on
Herbal stimulation have you gone like heron
And when you come inside their eyes open 
To the motion hopin to toke what I'm smokin'

Adjust your set perfect to get the head wreck
This here the next though not very complex
On text there'll be a test so check the context
Uno take the herb load up the slid
Numero dos take a deep breath and close your eyes
Tres spark fuego toke pull and hold
Until the weed stop expanding and your eyes explode
Then blow your hit out stretch out get the shit out
Float into Beijing holmes and flex your stidyle
Then smoke the bomba to steel drums and conga riffs
Blue seas from cool breeze and head trips
Full luscious lips and hips that's down dips
All spark but no one trips takin' outta turn hits
And when one burns out roll one we all say
Baby let the bells ring spark one for Beijing

Wow I bet you tore back now seeming pristine 
Geisha dancin' on a violet cloud
Jewel trees show where cool breeze blow
You can watch a waterfall flow where the mushroom grow
Everybody irie out on a level higher sit by the fire 
With pit bull and Bengal tiger
Ancient shogun exhibit what they know son
Metal be hurtin' no one in the land of no gun
Higher than high if you want to you can fly
See one time hold you shit high and drive by
Pump your sound hot box don't roll it down
All sing Beijing it's my type a town

Silver that brightly gleam in a lightning flash

See I respect how I groove and it's emotional prye

Drugs and sex, rockin shows and possible arrests
To last breaths livin the high life avoiding wrecks
And passin the low life tests with stripes mic checks get
blessed
On any set Pyschos bring threat to upper deck
Authority reps fear bald heads and tatted necks
We earn the respect and get heat from the rest
So we deal with stress however we can 'till our deaths
Inner city district experiences we recite
If you can't relate to this well all right
Get you shit tight run little drugs in daylight
Despite the lifestyle you know you need to get right

Deliverance,"I am your messenger and your plea has been granted
You must leave at once, go back to your planet
Your time is limited so go at once to those
Who you're going to warn of your new God forsaken home

Don't play games with God this Hell we heard of is real

Deliverance,"Though you speak with tongues of angels
Was said so long ago
If love is not the motive
Your evil as our foe

I don't care if you prophesy
Or have the power to heal
If His love does not abide in you
What you do is not real

All you do is make the noise
You use the gifts just like toys
All you are is a sounding bell
With no love

You might be fooling everyone else
But you're not fooling me
You might even think you're fooling God
But believe me He sees

Don't be a fool
God is not mocked
For whatever you sow you'll reap

Don't conform to other's ways
Or let your heart remain where it is
In a garbage heap",No Love,1989
Deliverance,"Insanity is filling me with unreality
My mind is a pit of morbid fantasy
The more my mind wanders
The more I indulge of a fantasy so un-utterable
The more real it becomes

Imagine I am the king and you are the queen
You lied and said you would set me free
Of this temporary insanity

I look in the mirror and what do I see
That I have become an image of Thee
To take your own life is what you have schemed
But for some reason unseen
The victim is me

The ultimate selfishness
To not care for no one else
Because all I think of is me
In my temporary insanity

I look in the mirror and what do I see
That I am you and you are me

Insanity is filling me with unreality
My mind is the pit of a morbid fantasy
The more my mind wanders
The more I indulge of the fantasy that was so un-utterable
The more real it has become

I have fulfilled my fantasy
I learned it was I who lied to me
Now I burn eternally
In my temporary insanity




",Temporary Insanity,1989
Deliverance,"An innocent man's blood was shed
Foretold this was in past
It will cleanse the people of their sin

Having done all to stand
In victory from above

There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins
The price has now been paid
For you

The time has come for you to choose
Choose whom you will serve

Deliverance,"Slaves to the power of sin
Once in captivity to darkness; spiritually dead
A voice cried from the top of a hill
""It is finished""!
It awakened those who were once dead
But now we live
For us
Now we live a new life in freedom
Not being enslaved by the power of any
Jesus' blood has made us free
But the battle still remains
We contend not with flesh and blood
But with spiritual darkness

[Chorus]
For this we wage war
But not against man
This war is with darkness
And not against flesh and blood

The Holy Book makes it clear as to how ought to fight
Put on the armor of God
Not by your might
Pray always with all supplication
In the spirit
to the pulling down of strongholds and crushing of Satan's plan

A hero dies but once
But what no one else has seen
Is the truth that lies inside
That behind the eyes of a hero lies a fear

A fear
No less than mine
I say it time and time again

I don't want to be alone in this solitude
What is truth?
Once one had asked
And still he seeks to find it
A man's fear is crushed when thoughts recall words heard so long ago

Speaks to my heart and to my soul In this solitude

Deliverance,"Have You Ever Thought About Your Soul
Can It Be Saved?
Or Perhaps You Think That When You're Dead
You Just Stay In Your Grave
Is God Just A Thought Within Your Head
Or Is He A Part Of You?
Is Christ Just A Name That You Read In A Book
When You Were In School?

When You Think About Death Do You Lose Your Breath
Or You Do Keep Your Cool?
Would You Like To See The Pope On The End Of A Rope?
Well You Know That Ain't Cool
Well I've Seen The Truth Yes I've Seen The Light
And I've Changed My Ways
And I'll Be Prepared When You're Lonely And Scared
At The End Of Our Days

Could It Be You're Afraid Of What Your Friends Might Say
If They Knew You Believed In God Above?
They Should Realize Before They Criticize
That Jesus Is The Only Way To Love

Is Your Mind So Small That You Have To Fall
In With The Pack Wherever They Run?
Will You Still Sneer When Death Is Near?
And Say They May As Well Worship The Sun?

I Think It Was True It Was People Like You
That Crucified Christ
I Think It Is Sad The Opinion You Had
Was The Only One Voiced
Will You Be So Sure WHen Your Day Is Near
Say You Don't Believe?
You Had The Chance But You Turned It Down
Now You Can't Retrieve

Perhaps You'll Think Before You Say That
God Is Dead And Gone
Open Your Eyes Just Realize That He Is The One
The Only One Who Can Save You Now
From All This Sin And Hate
Or Will You Still Jeer At All You Hear?
Yes I Think It's Too Late

Deliverance,"(Jimmy P. Brown II, George Ochoa)
You run, you hide, but soon you'll find
That your life has been put on the line
Keep going, soon you will see
That the one, you once called friend
Is now your enemy

That causes the flesh to give in

You ignorant fool, study the first eight chapters of Romans
It's the beat
Don't give me your opinion, show me a chapter and a verse
Adam sinned before a drum, used by man that was created
Read the Genesis account, learn from your ignorance
The church of Satan holds rituals to the classic works you lift us holy?
Wagner and Rachmaninov in complete contradiction
Old bar song's now made to hymns
You classify as blessed by God
But several hundred years ago
You called evil, but who was wrong
Why don't just tell me what beat, did Eve first sin to and to which did
Adam disobey?

Della Reese,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1960
Della Reese,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew
And never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too
From Maine to Albuquerque

Alas, I missed the 'Beaux Arts Ball'
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where
They honored Noel Coward

But social circles spin too fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care, I'm broke, it's okay
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,1960

Della Reese,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

We kiss, and the angels sing

I never dreamt it could be

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And won't let me go,
I turn to you for consolation.
There I find new peace of mind;
To leave behind my woe
I turn to you as I shall always do.

The touch of your lips upon my brow,
Your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress,
My heart forgets to beat.

The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.

Della Reese,"Here we are, out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning, see how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are, in the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone, from the frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
But too much in love to break away

Do you remember, the nights we used to linger in the hall
Your father didn't like me at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rent this little nest, get a bit of rest

Here we are just about the same
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And so much in love, so much in love
Too much in love to say, too much to say, to say
goodnight

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost it's charm

But the age of miracles hadn't passed,
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day,1993

And low as can be?

Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories

Changin' by leaps and bounds
It started up in the bigger cities
And it's spread to the smaller towns

And the people began to smile at people
They’d never even seen
And when Jeremiah woke me up this morning
I was ready to live that dream

It’s a brand new day
It's brand new way
Yeah, it’s a brand new day
It's brand new way

Mother called father on the telephone
Because she was upset
She said, ""The boy left home, naked this mornin’
All he took was the TV set""

And then the sister picked up the extension
And she said, “He’s just doin’ his thing”
And then the father hung up on the mother
And all the children began to sing

It’s a brand new day
Doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

We gotta put our heads together
And see where we go from here
We gotta fight for what we believe in
'Cause there’s somethin' in the air

It’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Twenty million shadows stormin' at the gates
How can we be surprised
With the image of their fallen kings
Reflected in their eyes

And the twenty million tongues are shoutin’ now
It's only heard by a precious few
But the years of night are gonna pass forever
When the sun comes shinin’ through

On a a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
It’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Mama, it’s a brand new day
And you have had your way

And you have had your way

We're gonna do it our way

After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

Stormy weather
Just cant get my poorself together,
Im weary all the time
So weary all the time

If he stays away old rockin chair will get me.

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,1998

Delly Ranks,"Rain, such a simple thang
Every drop, a different stop
But they all come from the same
God is the cloud
And we are the rain
That's why I sometimes feel
That somehow we are the same
 
Whenever I lay my head to sleep
There's a strong thought that keeps haunting my mind
Careless whispers of a nation
That somehow was caught trapped in the dark
And nowhere to go
I know my thoughts are tellin' me

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

Life has no guarantees
That you'll keep what you have
Even though you're blessed with then
That's why I'm feeling
Some fear for the world
With all the grief and misery
How much real time is there

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world
The irony of tryin' to do the right thing
Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness
And you say

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

The world is what we make it
What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today
It's a shame that peace and respect
Has been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others
Don't you see, love - that's the key

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not runnin', for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see, first it was a dream, I was livin' in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the WORLD ranked number one
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
about the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world
Huh-huh, huh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world

People started flowin' as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringin' me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancin' to the beat and entertainin' La-Di-Da-Di
The music started endin', it was time for a speech
The crowd started sittin' as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream, I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please, for stoppin' this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know out that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one king!

If I ruled the world
Huh huh huh huh, huh-huh huh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, whoa yeah
If I ruled the world

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rollin' with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker emcees that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king, and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's runnin' the show

And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doin', and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war, and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dyin' overseas
While you sucker mission politicians bustin' out Z's
Huh, twenty million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe

And it's time for a change, to a better way
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
They came up to my face, as happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

Delroy Wilson,"Sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings,
you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone;

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down.

He comes round here with a license to love 
But I don't know where he got it 
I trusted you offered everything 
But I'm not sure you deserve it 

You tell me that I'm lucky 
But I feel like giving up 
Cause a heart like mine's wasted on you

Throw it away

You take my over analyze away
It's you and me
Against the world today

Feels like I'm running
With my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting
For it to all go wrong
You're my umbrella against their
Sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling
They'll never know

It freaks you out when the ground starts shakin'
And everything around you is breakin'

Dad's two lives he was keepin' it a secret

We're all walking on quicksand
When we think that we understand, God laughs

I've been a sound board tryin' to be neutral,
Born in the middle, it's hard to be useful,
It's been hell, if I had to be truthful,
Oh! When people grow apart
And people can change
But it leaves a lotta mess
That someone's gotta clean up
It happened here to the family that I love

All the dark matter at the center of this black hole
It's gonna pull us under if we don't let go

I'll leave the bed light on
And place your water glass where it belongs
And if alright
I'll lie awake at night
Pretending I'm curled up at your side

See I'm circling these patterns

I'm still a long way from accepting it
That there's just no you and me

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's alright
I'll still be loving you

Is it just me
Did I commit a crime
I won't believe that loving you
Is just a waste of time
Or was it in my head

An old man died, but the help won’t come till Monday next
And he’s gone to meet the architects of the only world he knew

And he’s lonesome

And the family mourned, at the wake he lay in front of them
Just as silent as he’d ever been to any young child’s eyes
And by buried skin, they shed their laughter and their tears
The pain of all those early years where innocence had died

The blood we've been spilling will bleed us dry
The life we've been killing is your life like mine?

The blood that's been pumping still hasn't met you
The beard that I'm growing not fully grown
The years are not coming the way I thought they would

I'm hoping and waiting for something to sing
Like the angels in heaven, the bones on the street
Hoping for love to find a new voice
The song that needs singing has already been sung before

He is just a reason why I'm still here

But yes I had lost it, yes my eyes they are green

Knocked me for a loop, but I could still breathe
He had the crowd going by appearance
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and gods
I bust back with an onslaught of hydrothermiclyde
To burn their third eye
Tho outnumbered I come wit heat
And trigger a massive explosion to the beat
They hit me with compressed air left my chest bare
My sonic stun gun takes em out by the next snare

Just as the oxygen tanks were runnin out
So we're back to the ship
Pull a map from our blip
Manipulate the cursor
Recharge our essentals
Set the coordanants then flow
Through a trillion miles of space
With style and grace
Next stop Pluto to rock these new flows

Be strategic like a chess game

He dazzled me, adding three points to his score
Engulfed the microphone with darkness added three more
The panel started to roar
I had to find the core of his power
He streached his text, causing me to blackout
It took my dat out
I couldn't back out
It took out the sound man
I'm takin' a poundin
I bust out an a cappella that's astoundin
Project a unibeam through his spleen
Pulled out my x-ray cannon to disinigrate the phantom
Its night finite cell structure ruptured

Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space

He was a quadraped, four arms
He hit me with four four arms full of bronze

Squeezed out his brain like juice

Barrels like oil spills, avoid real people who live on the upper crust
It wasn't us

No casual contact, so fuck the format
Crowd get rushed when I crush this beat flat
Consider this a melding of the minds
A secret message transmission to all kind
And the scene gets raw when they see this
Apocalyptic pyre eclipse
How can money be spent
In a land where money holds no value? Count your cents

The government fakes aid to invade they enemies
Take they energy and enslave they families
Now the planet reverted to cave man mentality
May trade your child for somethin' to eat
And a six pack ""Yo bro, where'd ya get that?
Yo I'll trade ya for this troll
You can work 'em till he get old
And then sell him in the food farm
Where they harvest the elderly for hamburger""
And that's murder! Ah we gonna stop that
Soon as we got that, red alert
It was time to hit the dirt
Mission first, cause the war ain't over
More on a covert level like COBRA
Against GI Joe, who be my foe in this case
Cause the government was lyin' in the first place

Warpspeed to the new scenario, where we roam
Our tiny planet was continuously shrouded in darkness
From greed and anarchic conquest
The final operation, based ideas and proposals
Involving privateers, serving low blows to constellation patrol
Just to overthrow and obtain supplies for the side that they ride for
Privateer raids on the core system while the whole planet under war conditions
Taking more victims
Then a mutiny taking over government control in attempts to secure a new republic
What became of it?
Planet wide destruction
Constant weapon fire crushing any production
Of advancements of science
Technology to ease life's difficulty
Every tax dollar went to sweep crime
Off the street but the law would cheat each time
So operations backfire defeating the design
Seems like a leap in time, back to simpler days
Where technological advances were minimal
Whoever survived were thrust into dimmer days
Every portion of the land decimated in a blaze
Law and order fractured

The star of the show was entertained but a bit afraid

It's the return, check it

It's like clockwork, it's just like clockwork

As I view a long stretch of sand dunes
And abandoned shacks and crack houses with rats out in the clear open
I see a few hopeful transients
Grab a frisky critter to roast for food
Don't know what to do, it was out of our hands
Now we gotta pull straws, figure out a plan
I'm mobbing with a posse, a clan
Of ragtag renegades, looking for living grenades
Live ammo, 'cause it's been on the stage
Cutthroat, corrupt folks
Pressure to much to cope
We see a woman get jumped by young punks
High off of Nitro 9
Ain't no life behind
Those black pupils
No scruples
No rules so
She at they mercy
Or so they first think
I leap first seeing perfect opportunity
Ah, socked two or three in the mouth
Without room to speak

The rest of our posse
Peek and nod (?)
And proceed to beat (?)
The bruisers confused and dizzy

Toss them in a trash compactor
Now they history
The woman was hysterical, in fits of grief
Yo miss, please calm down, they all gone now
Literally minced into little bits between pieces of leftover Chef Boyardee
Mixed with a couple of booty magazines

It's the return, check it
Deltron zero and automator
It's like clockwork, it's just like clockwork

Final Frontier, desolates and pestilence
Vessels incapacitated, left vacant in a burning husk

Word is government does
Not control anyway

The streets have the last say
That's not hard to see
More cars than trees
Or more like lumps of metal

Nuclear fallout crawls out
And sometimes blinds people, leaving them with no sight
No rights, muggers in broad day
Similar to the ancient fables of the wild west
Or maybe just a trial or test
For humans who thought they were superior and more than houses of flesh
Highly upset

Human beings seeing no way
Going straight
Anarchy flows through the alleyways
Little chance for me and my band, go tooth and nail
Because music has no one grimmer than future entails (?)
Can't nobody use it as well

Cause many quit the craft after the pay for it
Became minimal
Then the full republic backlashed to outlaw
Music production
Completely
It was discreetly
Neatly accomplished
Under our noses, but a few were still on the quest

To keep the globe whole, full, and vigilant

The seasons continue to pass. Spring became summer.
Fall dimmed into the winter's cold light

Society continued to erode as the people began to collapse
under the weight of economic despair

10 years had elapsed
since there had even been a blip of information
on the whereabouts of the mythical duo

Occasionally a story would be heard
a rumor from an unreliable source in a bar, or some place like that

Inevitably, it would be discounted as drunken hearsay
much like Area 51 or the Loch Ness Monster
until they were eventually proven to be true, of course

One by one the banks began to collapse again.
Politicians were running out of flocks to fleece.
The middle class had faded into irrelevance.
Anarchy had started to peek its head out

A small glimmer of light appeared in the distance.

La chanson sans l'amour non plus, il faut les deux

Que le tam tam raisonne du fond de l'estomac d'un affamé

Que l'avidité le frappe là froidement sans pitié ni regret 
Quand le dernier flash annonce fièrement ses derniers morts 
Que la haine mène au score mais que la peur se rapproche dans un ultime effort 
À l'heure où les rêves naissent embellissants les nuits des mômes 
Les cauchemars eux, depuis bien longtemps partagent le lit des hommes 
À l'heure où la lune se révèle souveraine et éclatante 
Eclairant les pas des pommés et autres âmes errantes 
Quand l'ultime cigarette termine sa vie dans l'cendrier 
Et qu'les derniers guerriers s'écroulent dûrement touchés par l'canapé 
Quand le dernier coup de minuit sonne, que toutes les rues s'ennuient

Des nuages noirs planent sur un amas d'existence 
La résistance apparaît comme seule évidence 
Vérité à narrer, le chant de nos erreurs raisonne 
À l'heure où des armées d'esquifs à nos côtes amarraient 
Tracent une esquisse d'un idéal sur sa peau halée 
Tant de vestige écroulé sous l'assaut d'l'eau salée 
Larmes de joie ou de peine ruissellent en ces phrases 
On chante ce blues sur les toits comme le fait o'malley 
Rangés dans les cases à l'heure ou les ailes devaient s'ouvrir 
Le monde est ainsi fait qu'aimer fort amène à souffrir 
D'où tant de vengeance de beat payback 
Soit on vise la maybach soit la vie laid back

Babygirl, follow me to the west room
Now get buck wild

I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go round and round
Do you want me to
Don't say you won't
I know you do
Most girls play shy
It won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow-wow

In the shower for 3 hours, ended on the couch
My backs shots got her shakin' like she been to Harlem

And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
They got my fraction but I fucks 'em up like battery acid

You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation

I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day

Demania,"The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I

Now love is gentle, and love is kind
the sweetest flower when first it's new
but love grows old, and waxes cold
and fades away like morning dew

There is a ship, she sails the sea
she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I
and both shall row - my love and I

Toss me off when I'm toking a bong

Jesus I'm in love
A gift sent from heaven 
From the good lord up above

On the edge of the unknown
She wasn't good looking
But I had to take her home
Her face was like a rhino
Her body was blubber and fat
But when I looked between her cheeks
I knew that's where it's at

I can't seem to find a light I cannot find my way

My mind wanders in the shadows I cannot hear a sound, a zombie screams and a werewolf howls
My world is going down

Who's that looking in the shadows
Who's that screaming in the night
Who's that hiding in the darkness
On this moonlit night

He walks into a graveyard
He cannot hear a sound
He's in a trance his mind possessed
His soul is going down

He fades into the distance finds his tomb of rest he's got his peace his sanity though his friends knew best

Reached the mist to save him
Afraid I was too late a banshee wails a full moon rising he's at that devil gate

I've heard so many stories about the evil dead now they come and haunt me now as I lay here in my bed

Yeah, we make the bells ring
(It's on, it's on)

Drums
Yeah
A little guitar, please
One, two, three, four

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
La-la-la-la-la, let me see how you rock
It's on, it's on, it's on
Show me
Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock, we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, dance till we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
(What you got)
La-la-la-la-la, let me see how you rock
It's on, it's on, it's on
Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
(Over the top)
Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock, we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, dance till we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

One, two
One, two, three, four
It's on!",It's On,
