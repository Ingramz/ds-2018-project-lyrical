Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily

I can work miracles
I work it physical
And when I love you close, you can feel my heart breathing through my clothes

Future,"I walked through a pool of water and I seen the shadow of a broken hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar, for better or for worse

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me, stand by me

I ain't pop no Molly but you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop

We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together

They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D

Stand by me, yeah, my darling, stand by me, yeah

Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big

Therefore, you shouldn't judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear

Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga
Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions

Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York
But I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick, nigga

Fellas sleep at the gamblin' house with that heater right on me
And I got me some stripes like I got some Adidas on me

Young nigga jumpin' out the Ghost
Choppin' like Kung Fu
Used to want to fuck two, now I want to fuck the crew
Got bad bitches in the rear
Me and young Metro jumpin out the lear
The fresh new gear made a bitch disappear
The fresh pack of mollys make the bitch go to work
Some lean and the kush so I made the pussy squirt
I'm gon' fuck her throat when she get home from church
Some real good head make a nigga come back
Chasin' that cheese cheese nothin' but a rat
Free band game, nigga pull up on flex
Bitch got knocked up then she got wet
I'm talkin' 'bout murkin' that pussy like blat

Chez nous en disant rien, on a tout dit
Toujours en live du vaisseau mère
J'eus Alzheimer quand ils me questionnèrent
Quand je pense à toi, je pense missionnaire, pas légionnaire
Je suis en poster dans la chambre à ta mère
Dans le bureau du commissaire
Je suis cocaïne, t'es somnifère
Mon Dieu, comment autant de faux négros prolifèrent
J'ai le meilleur flow de l'univers
Mon Glock ma première femme, j'ai donc laissé Lucifer
Je gagne à la loterie, fume 20 oin-j

Tony Montana and I got the yayo
These bitches be loving a nigga for hitting a hater
Shit, these bitch ass niggas won’t let me have my moment
No condolences to my enemy
Bagging up, selling these coca leaves
Then I go take me a shopping spree
I want a brand new AR with a 100-round drum on it
That money really make her cum, bitch
Then go put your tongue on it
That bitch really yours, nigga?
You better put alarm on it
I ain’t go to Harvard, nigga

Shoot at you niggas, saying, “Fuck all the beef!”
I got ammo for days
Hunnid round on the K
Mac-11 in the Bentley
And I ride for my real niggas
Only God can judge me
When you live in the field nigga
When you don’t feel niggas
Sometimes you gotta kill niggas

You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don’t leave us like that man!"" cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life",I Need a Doctor,

Where the trees arc slow, in the shape of 'you know'

Echoing herself, she says, ""will you walk close to me?""

Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, be minus five,

음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal

견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네

Give me the lover's curse

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the
Bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day",Silver Bells,2007
G,"Hearing the refrain
Washed up by the rain
Hopeless and low
Silly stories and life goes on
Stand there till the end
Is there enough time to wait
Useless and low
Boring stories and life goes on 
So give me reasons to ignore it
If I stuck hard on it, will you sit quiet?
A couple of different ends to the stories
If I stuck hard on it, will you sit quiet? 

Maybe you will complain, how quiet you go on it
Thinking about the changes
How quiet you go, I stuck hard on it and you sit quiet!",After the Rain,2007

Don't want to hear your sound
Don't you try it

And every word is true
The colour that suits you is blue

You are sleazy and two faced
I can't believe I missed
What you were all about
Trying to use me but your game ran out
You can't take advantage of me
My eyes are open now
Trying to use me to get into my crowd
You're all about the hype
When you see me on TV
Two weeks later talking my name
You're the one to blame
Then you try and dress likeme
Talk like me
Are you crazy?
Why are you trying to claim
For you I've only got one name

Trying mess don't fk with me
Can't you see that your games run out
In the beginning all you did was doubt
Didn't know that I'd catch your game
Couldn't fit in my crew anyway
Now if you don't know
I'm agive you a clue
You're lame
You're broke
Let the fellas take a stroke
Of the skit that you are
Use the fellas for the cars
Use me for my bra
And she thought you would scar
Hell no, I'm selling records
Got no time for the haters
Got them shook up with my Lyrics
When I'm fluffin' with my digits
want to hate me
want to be me
Got me vexed
Got me so angry

You know the longest way round is the shortest way home.
Gabriel, wherever you go,
You know the longest way round is the shortest way home.

When you were here there was a beating of wings
In your heart doing senseless things.
When you were here there was a forest fire
Raging in you like a wild desire.

Gabriel, wherever you roam,
You know the longest way round is the shortest way home.

And everything you did only skimmed the surface of the day.
And deep inside there was an emptiness that would not go away.

The FEDS tried to link Da Rainjahz to the crime
Through the use of genetic material

Big horse, plus you walk like your salads been tossed
Smoke the explosion, rock second hand gold that's stolen

Straight haul off and smack a nigga just for posin'
Bleed Hennessey, rhyme like there's Ten of me
So you remember me?
Every verse, I'm on should be considered a felony

Why the fuck niggas be hatin'? I don't even know
Niggas need to go ahead with them outdated flows

Hurricane Mitch

Fuck the fame, son, I'm in it for the dough and another whip
Ghetto cracked out on some other shit
Style switch, leave the whole city dark like the Mothership
Y'all know the half, I hold the Nine with the rubber grip

Seen less, y'all re-imported by the government
If I wasn't rappin' I'd be on the corners bubblin'
Doublin' my cream on a triple beam
Instead I keep the team tight and feel like ain't shit gon' divide us

Not even riches, not even bitches
Look now, niggas of the World stay paintin' pictures
Of the inner-city realness
Who can relate? roll and fat one and feel this

G Daguerre,"Qu'on ne touche jamais aux folies, aux orages
Qui, chez moi, naissent et meurent entre passion et rage
Et que mes grands délires me fassent toujours escorte.
La raison est venue, j'ai demandé qu'elle sorte.

Qu'on ne décide pas de mes joies, de mes larmes.
A chacun son soleil, et à chacun ses drames
Et si le noir, pour moi, est couleur de lumière,
La raison, que m'importe, et qu'elle aille en enfer.

Mais comment voulez-vous, qu'un enfant laboureur,
Si on lui prend sa terre, fasse pousser ses fleurs,
Ses fleurs?

Que jamais on n'écoute, derrière mes volets,
Pour voler mon piano, pour voler mes secrets.
Mes secrets sont pour vous, mon piano vous les porte
Mais quand la rumeur passe, je referme ma porte.

Qu'on ne m'ordonne pas, je suis reine en mon île.
Je suis femme en mon lit, je suis folle en vos villes
Et j'ai choisi mes hommes, j'ai bâti mes empires.
Au diable la raison, et vivent mes délires!

Mais comment voulez-vous qu'un grand Pierrot de Lune
Écrive des chansons, si on lui prend sa plume,
Sa plume?

Qu'on ne touche jamais,
Que jamais on n'écoute,
Qu'on ne décide pas,
Qu'on ne m'ordonne pas

Et je serai pour vous, un enfant laboureur
Qui fait vivre sa terre, pour vous offrir ses fleurs,
Ses fleurs

Et vous pourrez venir, vous reposer tranquilles.

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

G'baby Reeves,"I'm thinking of my soul's sovereignty,
and I know everything you hate in me.
Fill me up with over-pious badgerings,
to throw them up, oh, one of my favorite things.
Remember all the lessons fed to me?
Me the young sponge, so ready to agree.
Years have gone; I recognize the walking dead,
now aware that I'm alive and way ahead.
Too bad the things that make you mad
are my favorite things.
And I'm so happy.
I see you looking, I know that you're thinking
that I'll never go anywhere.
The things that I've done and the things
that I've seen, I don't really expect you to care.",Favorite Things,2006
G'baby Reeves,"Will I ever get to where I'm going?
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned?

I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand

Will I ever get to where I'm going?
If I do, will I know when I'm there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
Would I even care?

I would
I take a look around
It's evident the scene has changed
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere
Really fucking fast",Nowhere Fast,2006
G'baby Reeves,"Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy?
Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore?
Maybe it's me but this line isn't going anywhere
Maybe if we looked hard enough, we could find a backdoor
(Find yourself a backdoor)

I see you in line, dragging your feet
You have my sympathy
The day you were born, you were born free
That is your privilege

Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me
Doesn't have a clue why he is waiting, or what he's waiting for?
Maybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy
Maybe if I look in my heart I could find a backdoor
(Find yourself a backdoor)

You have my sympathy
The day you were born, you were born free
That is your privilege",Privilege,2006
G'baby Reeves,"I'm home alone tonight. 
Full moon illuminates my room, and sends my mind aflight. 
I think I was dreaming up some thoughts that were seemingly possible, with you.
So I call you on the tin can phone. 
We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure we're alone. 
Think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free.

When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away,
Making sure to laugh; while we experience anti-gravity.
Anti gravity x2.

For years, I kept it to myself. 
Now potentialities are bound, and living under my shelf. 
Simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy, and we'll be there.

We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure we're alone. 
I may have found the way for you and I to finally be free",Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song),2006
G'baby Reeves,"I'd like to close my eyes and go numb
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high rise today

It's not a breeze ?cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

Do you think I should adhere
To that pressing new frontier
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?

Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

Don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold

Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old",The Warmth,2006

The Ocean looks like a thousand diamonds
Strewn across a blue blanket

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

With holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy happy)

Yo, if you make a lotta cream and don't share them stacks
Yeah, it ain't where you from, it's where you at
I know a lotta niggas that'll tear your back
It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
Listen, if you goin out of town and don't bear them gats
It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap

Ain't nothin' 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin
The slug-givin' little shortie on the snub itchin'
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin'
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)

Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)

The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin' just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this

Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South

To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun

이번엔 다를 거란 착각 혹은 기대 uh

결국 몇 년이 지났을까 영원이란 건 없다
결국 인연이 아닌 걸까 다시 혼자가 되다
겨우 겨우 겨우 진짜 사랑을 찾은 줄 알다가
결국 또 결국 이렇게 끝나버린다

내 마음은 처음부터 그대로인데 상처로 가득해 이젠 그대로 인해
점점 변해가 차가운 네 목소리에 나도 식어가고
멀어지는 우리 사이 되돌리기엔 아무 감정 없이 서로를 맴돌기엔
힘에 겨워 나 이별을 선물하고 돌아서 I’m fallin’ without you

결국 누구의 잘못일까 사랑이란 건 없다
결국 이별이 지는 걸까 지쳐 나 잠이 들다
겨우 겨우 겨우 여기까지가 마지막인지 우린

처음에는 몰랐겠지 그녀의 빈 자리가 좋았겠지
하루 이틀 모레 지나 보낸 뒤에서야 비로소 그녀가 고맙겠지
몰랐겠지 네 자신에 대해 너 없이 잘 살 수 있다던 그 확신에 대해
오늘과 다른 내일 벌써 1, 2년 이 시련만큼 늘어나는 미련
(미련 미련 미련)

시간이 지나면 달라지길 기도해

제발 단 한 번이라도 너를 볼 수 있다면
내 모든 걸 다 잃어도 괜찮아
꿈에서라도 너를 만나
다시 사랑하기를
지금 이 시간이 지나가고
다 잊을 수 있다면
그 기억도 행복했던 추억도
아니 다음 생에도 너를 만나
다시 사랑하기를

Demons chasing me, I ran from Lucifer Leviathan
The beautiful and damned, I got a fetish for the finer things

Skinny rich girls always askin' where the yay at
Throw a house party like cool, where you stay at?
Turn upside down, let her tweak on the wall

All these bay sounds, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin' up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay okay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected

No I can't stay here and hold her
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober
Can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong
I gotta go that's what I told her yeah

Uh she said she can't feel her face (she said she can't feel her face )
Yeah right now I can't feel my heart (right now I can't feel my heart)

She's fine as fuck and she knows it
Sexy body she shows it
Loves the drama she chose it
She draws the line then she blows it
The most fun I suppose it
Pops a bottle won't close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold
Homie I don't know she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish
Want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it
It's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it
I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still
Gotta play the hand if you dealt it yeah

Uh she said she can't feel her face (she said she can't feel her face )
Yeah right now I can't feel my heart (right now I can't feel my heart)

Wants to party, thumbs through a roll of decks for the dealers yeah

Scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside
Couldn't face the truth but everyone's got something to hide

U-Haul's waiting with all of our things
At least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happening
""Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?""
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused they try to explain but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Or for the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important
I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depressions a rotten curse
Hiding in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becoming more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her she was blue, her skin was cold, she wasn't breathing
Screamed, ""Melissa wake up"" couldn't fathom that she was leaving
Mom and bro was running down, I screamed ""somebody help""
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection

And when I'm dead and gone, I'll be there in spirit

You’re finna start rappin’ with a kid you went to school with
But, more on that later, right now you’re going through it
See, you’re going to have to prove that you ain't soft and you ain't stupid
And you gon’ have to scrap with some kids that you ain’t cool with
You got a short temper, just be careful when you lose it
You wanna be the man, but it’s gon’ take some time to prove it
You’ll fall in love, but she’s gon’ break your heart and put you through it
Fuck falling for that bullshit, you gon’ fall in love with music
You’re finna get arrested, almost fuck around and lose it
Spend days in juvy standing at the window, looking through it
Nothing in life is promised, not even free-time is
So, only chase dreams, and only chase commas
Won’t happen on its own, trust, trust, we’ve been through it

I mean, I was fucking up
I was seventeen, I was eighteen, just doing dumb shit
My moms made me move to New Orleans and shit, I went to school down there on a scholarship
I finally got my shit together, I started taking music seriously
Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit, almost

Dear Gerald, 21, you think you’ve got it figured out
Got a big head from them labels trying to bring you out
'Til they passed on you, they ain’t see what they was missing out
On, that flight home gave you some shit to think about
Scrambling trying to figure out, went back to the drawing board
Know they say rejection’s only supposed to make you want it more
But, no lie, you contemplating quitting, walking out the door
But, what the fuck you supposed to do? This is all you’re living for
Really it was that and Dev, that was all you had
Paying rent by engineering other rappers at the pad
Barely getting by, hella broke, you was doing bad
Then “These Things Happened”, you finally seen a bag
You drove down the highway, a fork in the road
A normal life with her, or going for broke?
I seen an open lane and I drove straight through it

If it was easy, everyone would do it
This game is not

Easy, easy

I literally sold all my shit
I moved out of my place in New Orleans
I was bouncing around, living out of a suitcase
Crashing on friends’ couches
Living at AirBnbs, hotels
Trying to make the album
Trying to make When It’s Dark Out
And take it there and be great

Dear Gerald, life changed since you dropped your second album
And Me, Myself & I just went 7x Platinum
Toured around the world, damn, you really had ‘em
But now you’re 27 and it’s time to be a legend
Back when it all started, grinding hard on that promo tour
Tired from the night before and the night before and the night before
Fuck it, tomorrow, gotta fly some more
Don’t complain, this is what you signed up for
You’re working for your family, managers, agents
They all want something different from you, tell 'em all patience
But, this one’s on you, the lonely quest of greatness
Been trying to be famous, been trying to be A-list
When you arrive, it will appear as if there’s nothing to it
But, you planted the seeds and you grew it
There’s people taking credit for success that they had nothing to do with

So now you’re here
What you gon’ do with it?
You know?

Yeah, uh, make no mistake, listen it’s the life that I was chosen for
All I prayed for was an open door
I’ve been rich, I’ve been broke before
I’ve seen the floor
You try to put me in a box, I’ll box out like Okafor
And fuck being indecisive now I’m so for sure
And fuck Trump, it’s like “What the fuck we voted for?”
And most of y’all should probably party less and focus more
And if that line resonates, you’re probably who I wrote it for
Where will I go from here? ""IDK""
They want me to architect Rome, in a day
Juice knew I was greatness when he looked at me
Right away, I’ve made platinum records that’ll never see the light of day
This is what the whole world’s been waiting for
The crowd’s jumping, going dumb 'til they break the floor
Come take a walk inside my mind, come and take a tour
I’m really not playing, what the fuck you take me for?

I’m just saying, give it a chance

Chastise, throw dirt on me
That’s how it is, don’t ask why
But, everyone’s got their opinion
But I don't know why cats lie
I would never let that fly
Honestly, I’m not that guy
Now, don't believe everything you hear
All these people wanna interfere
Fuck ‘em all, it’s our world
Can’t let 'em get into here
We could really build something strong
Think where we could be in a year
You've gotta give me a fair chance
Before you tell me we’re finished here
Already know you’ve been hurt before
Understand what you're afraid of
Talk's cheap, actions speak
Let me show you, I'm demonstrative
We could rewrite the whole stories
Let’s get it started, let’s get creative
‘Cause I'm the one, honestly and loyalty is what I'm made of

Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall

Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug

Jeden Tag gibt es neue Probleme (Doch keine Lösung)
Willkommen in meiner Gegend

Willkommen in Berlin, in der Stadt der Probleme
Das hier ist Berlin, diese Stadt in der ich lebe
Man steht in Berlin, Sport man die Macht der Straße
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz, wir sind einzigartig

Willkommen in Berlin, wir haben die größte Schnauze
Das hier ist Berlin, das hier ist mein Zuhause
Weil ich lieb Berlin und hasse dein beschissenes Kaff
Aus der Gosse in die Charts wir sind die Kinder der Nacht

Willkommen in meiner Stadt wo die Nacht zum Tag wird
Wo die Spack die grad' turnt nachts im Park stirbt
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht mach dich rar, Knirps
Blas' die Bars mit einer dieser Hits, die im Lauf liegt
Spits bis sie auffliegt, spit bis mein Licht in den Rauch zieht
Spit ich vernichte dich auch, Freak!
Du bist es nicht gewohnt, hockst den ganzen Tag im Dorf rum
Wo wir herkommen ist Hass oft an der Tagesordnung
Pack' die Rapsticks um ich mach Business
Hinter verschlossenen Türen wie Kabinettssitzung
Wie die Mücken auf der Bank in Bronx
Oder bar auf die Hand, oder ganz in Fonds.
Für den Rolls Royce und das Stückchen Land in France
Deine starken Strahlen strahlen wie Lampions
Und du boxt dich von unten durch
Auch wenn der Shit den du bringst nicht stimmt bist du unten durch

G-Hot,"Yeah, mein Loft, meine Finca, meine Achterbahn
Ich hab's versprochen, ich komm' wieder als gemachter Mann
Alles läuft krass nach Plan
Ich genieß' die Zeit die mir bleibt und werf' ein Blick in die Vergangenheit
Es war nicht gerade leicht, doch so wie es war wird es nie wieder
Nie mehr Hunger, nie mehr Kummer, nie mehr der Verlierer
Nie wieder arbeiten von 9 bis 5
Nie wieder Streit wegen Geld bis man die Freundin lyncht
Nie wieder vorm Schaufenster stehen und hoffen
Nie mehr einfach reingehen, es nehmen und rocken
Nie mehr sparen für was kleines, gleich das große kaufen
Nie wieder große Augen, nie mehr zum Trost besaufen
Nie wieder S-bahn fahren ohne Fahrschein
Nie wieder Party in Paris und nicht da sein
Nie wieder arm sein, nie wieder gar kein
Nie wieder fahr' ich nach Bayern und pack' Gras ein

Jetzt hab ich jedem bewiesen, ich steh' fest auf den Füßen
Hunderte von Perspektiven, ich bin ein gemachter Mann
Nie wieder früh aufstehen müssen, nie mehr aus dem Traum gerissen
Nie wieder lass ich mir sagen ""Straßenjunge, pass' dich an"" Nein
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder
Und jetzt die andere Seite
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder

Ich muss nie wieder in einer verranzten Bude ratzen
Ich muss nie wieder Ketchup mit Nudeln Fratzen
Ich brauch U oder S-bahn zu fahren
Man sieht mich jetzt in dicken S-klassen fahren
Ich klau' kein essen mehr an Tankstellen
Ich muss mich nie wieder an irgend 'ner Schlange anstellen
Ich bau' mir eine Zukunft auf
Ich muss keine Kassen mehr klären, ich klär nur noch Frauen
Ich muss nicht mehr um 6 Uhr früh ""Guten Morgen"" sagen
Ich muss nicht mehr 'n halbes Jahr die gleichen Jordan tragen
Ich kann mir jeden Tag was schickes kaufen
Ich kann dick buffen und muss nie wieder Stickys rauchen
Geldprobleme gibt's für mich nie wieder
Keine Inkassobriefe, kein Gerichtsvollzieher
Nicht mehr hassen, nicht im Park mit Dope ticken
Nur noch Models, keine Standard Hoes ficken

Jetzt hab ich jedem bewiesen, ich steh' fest auf den Füßen
Hunderte von Perspektiven, ich bin ein gemachter Mann
Nie wieder früh aufstehen müssen, nie mehr aus dem Traum gerissen
Nie wieder lass ich mir sagen ""Straßenjunge, pass' dich an"" Nein
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder
Und jetzt die andere Seite
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder

Mich hat Aggro gesignt, ich schlaf' jetzt abends gut ein
Ich brauch nie wieder arm zu sein
Doch die Straßen haten, ich hab Feinde im Hood
Ich kann nie wieder alleine in Club
Ob Drinks oder Klamotten, ich krieg vieles umsonst
Ich bin ein Goldrapper, nie wieder Features umsonst
Ich bau' nie wieder Scheiße, ich dreh nie wieder krumme Dinger
Nie wieder Plattenbau, ich wohn' nie wieder in 'nem Hundezwinger
Der Fame kommt und die Probleme gehen
Mir geht's gut, ich werd' nie wieder im Regen stehen (Auf jeden)

Nie wieder 'nen Chef der mir sagen will wo's langgeht
Nie mehr in der Kälte vorm Club lange anstehen
Nie wieder abblitzen, nie mehr die fetten Bräute
Nie mehr auf mein leben scheißen, ich benutzt Toiletten heute
Nie mehr bin ich nett zu Leuten, die mir einen Dreck bedeuten
Nie wieder geb' ich dir die Chance mich zu enttäuschen

Jetzt hab ich jedem bewiesen, ich steh' fest auf den Füßen
Hunderte von Perspektiven, ich bin ein gemachter Mann
Nie wieder früh aufstehen müssen, nie mehr aus dem Traum gerissen
Nie wieder lass ich mir sagen ""Straßenjunge, pass' dich an"" Nein

Whenever you need good lovin
You gotta understand, it takes a man, a man
To keep you satisfied

[chubb rock]
Ha ha ha
Now toys are for boys, men don't need mattel
Objects to manipulate and sell
The women or the girls whichever name flip your curl
Acts for nonsense delivered by the boys of the world
But I!! i.. am.. totally ignorant to that type of pride
Yell, when your groin starts to rebel
Yo l, I told you that we would sell
Oversell to the point now, that the pockets, start to thicken
How in the world did women become chickens
Is it the, alize or the weed
Shredded on the tray, that make the queens flow this way?
Me, I don't need none of that.. type.. drama
No typical style, for the man who rules the genre
The opera, no choir boys, I'll direct your band
Change your tune for the man, and..

You gotta understand, you need a man, a man

Ha ha ha ha
To redeem, I heard black men, I mean boys
Sayin they beat their queen, that type rush
Can't paint the scene, dissipates the dream
Of black king, black queen, becomin one team
From actress purses, harlequin romance verses
Ghetto curses, ends up in front of nurses
The yo-g male, the bourgeoise male
The two-car male and the male that needs mail
The woman start to, get empowered by alice walker
Waiting to inhale the fumes of the new yorker
Question - did you trust her, in front of pimps players
And hustlers, does she need a benz or a duster
End of question, start of answer, contradiction
Exhale, dangle in romance fiction
The love test, is like do you need to understand
Don't cram, you need a real man, and..

[chorus one] + [chorus two]

[chubb rock]
Ha ha
While the light gleams in her aspect
Does that mean respect, voiced by franklin, ignored by the inept
Baggy pants wearer, million man march bearer
All those who suffered through the agent orange era
Do we really maim the beautiful ones
The sons similak by anger, while the women get shunned
It's above me, another cop out, another rot out
Swapping +tears for fears+, while we +shout+ out
Past pain, that reverberates the claim
That the disrespect started when we, were in chains
Could be - but should be, it wouldn't be, if we
Real men, scriptured by the zen
And even then, women must know which is which
When their groins itch, for the rich damn
There's a lot to try, to somehow understand
Boys will be boys, but find a real man and..

G-Money,"[Syke talking]
Ain't been no love around here for a long time
When the love gon' come back
Huh, I don't know, I don't know
But till then, keep doing it like I do it

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed,
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related,
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear,
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last,
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
It ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug wit mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
 
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try,
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
They say reach in your heart and you will find yo mind
Everyday in the streets got my foresight blind
My aftertime is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some want to die I want to stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy,
After livin' so lofty
It cost me my soul outta control in a devil's world
Me my niggas and my girl,
It ain't no love

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us
