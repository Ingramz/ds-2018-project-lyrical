Big Bazar,"Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Mais je suis seul dans l'univers
J'ai peur du ciel et de l'hiver
J'ai peur des fous et de la guerre
J'ai peur du temps qui passe, dis
Comment peut on vivre aujourd'hui
Dans la fureur et dans le bruit
Je ne sais pas, je ne sais plus, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Mais l'amour dont on m'a parlé
Cet amour que l'on m'a chanté
Ce sauveur de l'humanité
Je n'en vois pas la trace, dis
Comment peut on vivre sans lui?
Sous quelle étoile, dans quel pays?
Je n'y crois pas, je n'y crois plus, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Mais j'en ai marre d'être roulé
Par des marchands de liberté
Et d'écouter se lamenter
Ma gueule dans la glace, dis
Est-ce que je dois montrer les dents?
Est-ce que je dois baisser les bras?
Je ne sais plus, je ne sais pas, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut, oh",Fais Comme L'Oiseau,2012

When we never thought it a crime

Big Bill Broonzy,"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
Oh, lord, well I kissed 'er again

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

He asked would I marry and be his sweet wife
Then we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
He begged daddy, pleaded like a natural man
And then, oh lord, I gave him my hand

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

I worked my day hard and so did my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to make a good life
With corn in the field and wheat in the bins
Then, oh lord, I was the father of twins

Oh

Our children numbered just about four
They all had a sweetheart knockin' on the door
They all got married and they didn't hesitate
I was, oh lord, the grandfather of eight

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

Now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
We had a lot of kids, trouble and pain
But, oh lord, we'd do it all again

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,

A sign was painted said: Private Property,

In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;

Big Bird,"With some paper and a crayon
And a helpful friendly bird
Elmo made four letters
That together make a word

Yes Elmo took a crayon
And on paper made a word

Elmo made each letter clearly
No two letters look the same
And when he was all finished
Those four letters spelled his name
Elmo

But the next part of the story
Is the part Elmo likes best
What happened next is Elmo put his writing to the test

Yes, Elmo took that writing 
And he put it to the test

Would the word that Elmo written
Work for anyone who read
Would each and every reader know what Elmo's writing said?

Yes! Elmo

And now Elmo has the answer
And now Elmo feels so proud
For each and every reader
Read Elmo's name out loud

Yes, all who've tried have read it
They read it right out loud
They read, Elmo, Elmo, Elmo

And Elmo feels so proud 
Elmo wrote his letters clearly
No two letters look the same
And when he was a finished
Elmo written Elmo's name

Me and my mans smoking on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Achmed's 'zookas on shoulders
Hundreds pounds of C4 in a stroller

I just dropped a million kroner, I'm a stoner

like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself
Dre set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, cause

Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 
God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 

Check it out, uh
If in this life 
I strive to please Him
In this day and night 
I'm not always right
Even when I'm wrong 
You should be afraid to anger Him
'Cause you could be gone
Him don't need us 
It's the other way round
Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody 
And say that's Him
'Cause He's invisible 
Yet visible, this is critical 
Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need him 
To help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask Magic about him 
Or any strong believer
He's the quarterback 
We the receivers
Catching blessings 
Better than touchdowns
I seek him when 
Niggas want to buck me down
Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names 
Him has many bibles
The devil can't deal with Him, uh
He tempted me but you see 
I'm still with Him
Listen close
All brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money
I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy, long life
Real good sex with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked
Book you got cooked
Book you got cooked

See
My relationship with the God 
Is kind of odd
The nigga the B-I-G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart
But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back
Better that I bust raps
The way that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it
Could it be (What?)
The niggas around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances 
Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen (Why?)
Cause you woke that ass up
Yoke that ass up
Proving the man in the sky
That holds that ass up
But it's over now
He cut off
Some niggas done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees 
And praise the only
Now your soul lost

Now, OK, now
The sun shines 
The moon glows
The wind blows
The rain falls
But that ain't all
My heart thumps on a rhythm why'all
And birds call
And two can fall madly in love 
Oh, I think grow
They stop and stare in awe
Because we in his likeness
Hoping and praying that one-day
In the lab they might just
Stumble on some kind of way
To create human beings
So far
Human kind is the only thing I'm seeing

She ready to eat it whenever I skied it
She did it in the dark but in the light she won't do it
She be unzippin' my pants she be gettin' straight to it
No, it was not a dream, even though that's what it seemed
I kick, I scrat, I skit, I scrat, I scream
The shit was feelin' freaky, she was feelin' fine
I didn't feel her teethes, I only felt her tongue
Relax, I'm gettin' massaged by tha massouse
She wouldn't let me gi-zzo, she wouldn't let me loose 
I don't know her she was somebody else 
But I was happy that's why I said to myself
But this shit was nothin new, she do it anyway
She didn't want to talk she ain't got nothin to say but

Uh oh, there they go, the Red Dogs swerve

Jumped out, ?Man, damn, they got nerve?
Got the hell on, dropped everythin' includin' my word
Now it's off through the woods we go, here we go
Tossin' the greens an' blow, oh no

Dippin' through the trails, runnin' from twelve

If it's beef, I'll choke ya an' leave you for the vultures

Dirt work, nigga, we don't play
I got a couple on the tool an' a few on the way

I'm about a four an' a half into workin' these slabs
An' about a hundred away from back in the lab
Now I done bust the next batch down an' my face lookin' drab
Uh oh, yep, this nigga done served me some bab

Me sad? Naw, mad
Quick to bust your ass
Playin' around wit a hustler's cash?
They'll find ya stankin' in the trash

An' escape wit your 'Billy Jean' an' 'Thriller' 'cause I'm 'Bad'
Who dat, them niggas wit the juice pack, you thought you had?
Naw, Dad, I'm glad my niggas keep a few thangs, wit a few mags
Down to toe tag, drop bags, switch tags an' haul ass

Smash till we out of gas, blast only if we gotta blast
Turn sunny days into an overcast
Abusive to the under class, when my tongue lash
An' I mash out wit OutKast

Dirt work, nigga, we don't play
I got a couple on the tool an' a few on the way
Dirt work, nigga, we don't play
I got a couple on the tool an' a few on the way

Dirt work, nigga, we don't play
I got a couple on the tool an' a few on the way
Dirt work, nigga, we don't play
I got a couple on the tool an' a few on the way

Big Boi,"[Chorus: x2]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags!

We arose, let's go
So fresh so clean"" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags

[Chorus]

It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes I remember havin' rocks in the hall
Onn the glimmer with the glock by the ball
Servin' up a jab and workin' security six to six
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
to the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a console full of ammunition and funds
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax
and Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

[Chorus]

Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin' 'bout me...
My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number twenty Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin Nu*Wear fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin'
Keepin' coke in the kitchen
Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
tucked underneath my Michelin S
I, travellin', handlin' with a forty-five cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin' hot through your motherfuckin' iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that
Talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat!

[Chorus]

Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you layin on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you want to blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin' a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means movie date, dinner date, lunch date, help me please

My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FEO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and smabbin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change

Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim

Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room

I give love and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be

I do, I do adore you
I'm the best man for the job
Another man couldn't do nothing for you
Cause you're spicy just like me
We come together like thunder and lightning
With all of that scratching and biting
So exciting it's frightening
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right not my just for tonight woman
Making me feel just like a baker quick to put something in your oven

Can you, believe I got it made
Impala in the garage, got forces and all the J's
I'm leaning bad, ride shotgun in the Chevy
With the homeboy burning sacs

We heading to the spot where we get down
Where the bitches at, they talking right, acting right
Walking right, now to take flight, they ain't gotta go home
They can stay the night

You can stay right here, put one in the air
While we are in the, corners of my chrome
Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere, wait a while

Nigga hold up, hold up
Make sure they see you when you roll
Hop out that truck all ready fucked up
Tore up from the motherfucking floor up

From the floor up, to the ceiling
Smoke kiss in the walls in the top of the building
Little momma's on [unverified], sitting next to me
She's catching a feeling and I'm feeling, like I'm 'pose to

I'm as fly as a Jordon poster, I'm leaning hair breathe
Smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic by the the time
My click find me in VIP I'm lost in a cloud of chronic had sex
With the best, got head from the rest, motherfucker believe I done it

Lay back, lay back, treat this eight six cut like a Maybac
Hey, show these suckas that after 50 million sold
Daddy fat sacs is still where the hood at, hood at

Hood rats and decoy be-boys understood that
Wheater its creme de la creme, where the good at
I got it in that 1.5, I had to put the swisher down

I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man

Some of them need to take some lessons

When I was young I was sprung off the way women used their tongue
I couldn't nut yet but fuck that, It was still fun to look
I took Vaseline even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
Now I'm grown and my bone is so well known hoes wanna get it cloned

Shit, ain't nothin' wrong with you chunkin' that monkey
All up on me 'til the whole room's funky
The negative thoughts, it's time to change
Shit, you a woman, I'm a man

It's all natural and we're compatible
I'll bend you over, knock you down
Slap that ass a little bit but not to hurt you

And fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann
Tight old pants, my mother's best friend

I watch all your movies and your DVD's
I heard you're comin' out with porno CD
I want Janet Jacme to smack me
Take your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me

I love porn but niggaz be hatin'

I like a lady but I sure love a slut
The type that like to sit on my dick and let me screw up them guts
The chick that want it doggy style while puttin' on my nuts
And when you aim up her face, shorty, don't be tryin' to duck

True Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck
Eat that coochie for an hour, after you shower cock 'em up
From the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin' up
Caught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up

But your spike leather collar plus stilettos lookin' tough
Now you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had enough
Like JLo in that movie where her husband beat her up
Puss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up

Now you need to go and get up 'fore I set up some more setup
I done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up
It's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast
I don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace

Me and Rick James got the same birthday. 
Simply means I'll grill you from Thursday to Thursday. 
7 days, 1 week, 168 hours. 
I got the power, to make you shout, 
But I'll knock yo' ass sour. 
Scream, scream, permanent on the team, like a Bantu, or a duke, 
Or a Just For Me! 
No lie, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt. 
You can sleep in the bed with me, 
At the foot of the bed, with your feet first. 
And, I will twirk you, you the only good smoking, 
Puffing better than purple, girl. 
I hope you fertile, girl.

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real

Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side
Chamillitary Mayne
And now for The Sound of Revenge
",Intro,2006
Big Boi,"Yeah
Ya gotta understand what I'm talkin' about
I'm talkin' about on this one
Sexy
Sexy as hell to me
Yeah

So let me tell ya 'bout a nigga I know
Six foot four
Two twenty-five
He's all the way live
See, where I come from
We like 'em like that
He don't talk smack
He just twist caps off
See, that's the only kinda dude I'm demandin'
And let the girl like me understand it
And the ones that ain't
They still gotta have it
They don't know why
But they stay chained to

[Chorus]
I need a hood boy
Wife beaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Go' on head, pretty nigga
We don't like them there
Need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys
Go on say

He knows how to treat a lady
But he won't let you get too rowdy
He stands up for himself
That's what I like most about him
He's all I see and all I need
And all that I want
And all that I'm used to
I swear that my man's the truth
I said I swear that my man's the truth

[Chorus x 2]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why say bye
Been fly
Ever since a nigga started sayin' bye
That's right, stand by
'Cause we about to take flight
Not a seven forty-seven
But the music and the microphone
Phone home
If you want someone waitin', baby
Go on home
Don't wanna jeopardize your safety
Maybe later
We shake the haters and gets busy
You say you wanna do same thing
Then get wit' me
If not, then hit me
I know you know the history
Last nigga ridin' 'round lookin' real crispy
Ridin' round town, top down
On the grizzy
Grind all the time to stay hot
Or even sizzlin'
I thought I told ya niggas
We run stop signs
'Cause we don't stop
Till the cops come knockin'
For two block signs
Not mine
Toine gone right
Like sunshine and cold north through summertime
Now, bow down

Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it

Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind

See into your soul, no limits to the levels me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game

I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it, going in and outta them lanes

I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up looking like there's something you wanna

Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited

Your dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I?ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you're trying to catch your breath

(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the force in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approached you, look how I expose you
Look how I done studied every move, now I know you

I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me

(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see, the passion's inside me
It's yours, now come try me, c'mon

Tell me
What you thinking about when your hands is all on me
?Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
?Cause you swept me off my feet, ooh

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited

I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe

Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you

Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be
Them niggas from the South
So one to the two, the three, the fo'
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, so I'ma get 'cha some mo'

But my pride wouldn't let me dial (oh couldn't you just tell me baby)
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression (don't say that no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely)

I need you, and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't answer baby yeah)
I tried to call (call me baby)

And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely)

Why don't you pick up the phone
And dial up my number
And call me up, baby?
I'm waiting on you",Last Night,2007
Big Boi,"Ahhhh.. I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Oooo  oooo yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the chatta nigga choo choo?

That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungle

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard;
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything in life don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams

Too Democratic, Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
You livin for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""Oh hell naw!""  But yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?  Whoo!
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision.. is,
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

Humble as a mumble in the jungle

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungle
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then 1 day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life

Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story,
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we,
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly.. but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end

Shake that load off, shake that load off [Repeat: x16]

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home...

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to bust how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen

Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A

Ever since the the tenth grade
We went from rockin' braids to temp fades
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers superfly
Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down
But it ain't so country my nigga this ain't no Gomer Pyle
I'm Sergeant Slaughter
I keep my shit cooked to order in order
To satisfy my people in Georgia and across the water
And across the boarder the essays are getting smarter.
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas.

Came up on the Gheto Boys and the Underground Kingz.
Toys, I had a brougham, called it pretty brown thing.
Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining.
Known to keep a bad bitch. No niggas beside me.
Index finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning.
Not to flex but to protect my neck like the Wu-Tang.
Self-preservation is the rule when you do aim.
Or get in something more sinister.
You gotta be the finisher
To make it sure the doctors, they can't replenish him.
Or bring him back to life.
Back to reality.
Gone get on some hoes leave it alone.

As if no one is standin' there

Just to let you know that everything is straight
I say stank you very much 'cause we appreciate the hate
Now go get yourself a handgun, you fuckin' with a great
Put it your mouth and squeeze it like your morning toothpaste
Kill yo'self like Sean Kingston, suicidal for a title
My recitals are vital and maybe needed for survival
Like the Bible or any other good book that you read
Why are seventy five percent of our youth readin' magazines?
Cause they used to fantasy, and that's what they do to dream
Call it fiction addiction 'cause the truth is a heavy thing!
'Member when the levee scream, made the folks evacua-ezz
Yeah, I'm still speakin' about it 'cause New Orleans ain't clean
When we shout Dirty South, I don't think that is what we mean
I mean, it mean the roguh, the tough, the dangerous, we reign supreme
Can slaughter entire teams with the ink that my pen bleeds
B-I-G, B-O-I nigga, please!

For those who think life is unfair
Cause I blow my smoke in the air
As if no one is standin' there
Then I'll roll one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows
In my chair, as I sit back smiling from ear to ear
With a fistful of your girlfriend's hair
Yes, she'll blow one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows

Don't want no girlfriends
Just need my dope (I just need my dope)
One foot on the world when, I'm behind in my smoke
(I'm behind in my smoke)
On the back burner, you can just simmer around
But on the front burner, you betta' burn, a fat one
(Roll it up fire that shit up)
A fat one, fire it up!
A fat, fat, fat one

This is that dope-on-dope, smoke but don't choke on
It's the shit, c-c-clearly blunt junkies have been known to croak-oak-oak
Unless them toke of it's, the bomb!
Bombardin' the brain, the bong infinitely plays the place to come
Came and went, hindbells spent, b-b-b-b-bent
Take another huff and puff and choke and toke
Icky sticky sticky and stuff a bowl and
Pack a pipe, twist a blunt roll, light a joint!
Cause this is the dope-on-dope, some good shit
Yeah, lean back and puff slow",Fo Yo Sorrows,2010
Big Boi,"With one stroke of the pen
I tune in to your satellite radio or FM station
I've been patiently waiting to weigh in
Been under construction for two years
But now it's 'bout that time I double-dutch my way in
Left foot, right foot, steppin' over biters
It's like the game is haunted 'cause there's so many ghostwriters
Me, see, I'm a lifer with supply that may seem endless
Straight rider like a biker on a chopper with a hit list
Witness the nigga that spit that vicious
Pit bull attack shit when it comes to this rap shit
Daddy Fat Sax, bitch, follow us

I know some of y'all done wrote a nigga off
Like the leases on these cars and these homes you niggas thought
You stayed in, with so many bosses, why are they still
Layin niggas off they job? Nigga, for real?
Gon' give a nigga a gig then
Help a brother get up out this pigpen
But nobody wants to keep it pimpin' or a hundred and ten
So with this pen I begin to illustrate from within, boy (boy)
Paint a pretty picture like I'm chilling with my friends
Everybody's got a pocket full of ends to spend
See Picasso couldn't blend, put it all together or fit in
I'm like a crocodile walkin' 'round with alligator skin
Yes I'm is the product of the ghetto where I lived
Call me Spongebob, boy, soaked up game as a little bitty kid
And never been a lame, before the fame I was the shit
And now I'm just Big, ya dig?

So come and follow us

See we not even gonna play with 'em either
We gon' la-la-lay it down every fucking time we see 'em
Make the club get crunk, yeah, we them type of people
But wait, it's not a sequel, no wait, it's BB's prequel
The beginnin' before the beginnin', spend it how you spend it
Then, if you sell dope nigga stack it when you get it
Can't trick it, or spend it until it's gone
That's slippery business homes, go get you a business loan
Come on

Now I lay you niggas down
You already sleep so bitch rest in eternal peace
You still scared of the Boogeyman?
I know you hatin' but you know you was a 'Kast and a Goodie fan

Big Boi,"Get the south dick up out your mouth
What you talkin' 'bout
See we know everything that you about
So try another route
Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built
Pick on somebody your own size and fuck around, get kilt
But not like the kilt above the knees
BB will plant you niggas like seeds
Or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Nigga take one for the team, now he's bleeding from the spleen
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
No blood splatter or evidence, long distance with a beam
We come in peace, while some of ya'll niggas come in greed gluttons
Fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed

Slow down nigga

""Speed it up"" like ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast
Not a hobby, this my life
You disrespect it, that's your ass
As one half of the Outkast return like ghost of Christmas past
It's the son of Chico Dusty
Must be West Savannah bad
Had to go to church on Sundays with Great Grandma and Granddad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track
Didn't say that Rico, Ray, and Pat was gettin' with me and three Stax
Then we spittin' cause we killing everything that we attack
Special forces of the rap game so you best take heed of that
All the shit you rappers lack, we got plenty, here's a snack
Don't ruin their appetite because your shit is really wack

Wack ass nigga
This shit's like breathing to me
Born and bred for it

Another battle won
Another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings
As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward
And rides off into the horizon of infinite regression, victorious
Undefeated on the battle field against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you could never be stripped of
And if you commit to that truth, then you could end the vicious cycle
That's affecting our youth today
If we just stop lying
If we just stop lying
Stop lying

Most time you hurt more than I, face it
Took blows to the heart, that's family
My mother been 20 years with a hustler
He always taught, never talk slick
A woman's place submit to a boss, couldn't take it
So many nights seein' momma on the couch stressin'
She lookin' at the clock, it's quarter past two
Next day, and still no sign of daddy
A hustler, always loyal to the customer
In love with the only example of family

Waitin' for the day to come
Like waitin' on the mailman first of the month
I'm a straight go-getter, trend setter
Make her more wetter when a nigga bust
Dude, I keep her soakin' wet to the touch (I do)
No joke, can't stop 'til she get enough
Like a paper towel, quick to pick her up
Blow smoke, chop chop, let her hit the blunt, nigga, what?
Up, up, up and away (and away)
I ain't fin' to front, from the jump or the giddy up, bruh
It's plenty pretty bitties in the city I'm from
And I'm gon' get me just one
To ride shotgun, do you hear me? Just one, one

Now come over, let me squeeze, you so tightly, let me see
Just what you can do for me, drop down low and shake it, please

Nothing in the world can keep us apart
Like Nettie and Seely from the start
My blood pumps red, but give me a purple heart instead

Kinda like a egg boilin' in a pot of hot water (Hot water)
Or like a Fed with a no-knock warrant
I want her, so I'mma go and get her, ya hear me?
We got her surrounded, she gonna give it to me
Give it up, gift wrap, hands up
Handcuff with the wrists back, back up (Back up)

We're gonna have you charged with possession of cocaine with intention to distribute
Man, I ain't sold that, man! That, man, why is you doin' that, man?

The rhymes I design are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
Giving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night, night, I recite when I step up to this mic
Reputation trunk tight, like the husband on a wife
Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on the smash
When your ass cross paths with this half of the 'Kast

I don't even think I need to hit y'all with another verse

Been ready for battle, General Patton's no beginner
I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Leave the rest to you, destitute, now put that money up
Oh, your conscience is nonsense
How you expect to get a little restitution with all this ghetto flyness?
Snow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons
Or bargains, three striked, then yanked up like a rod
Uh, with no apartments, and no home to run to
You're snitching on yourself, and now your front door, they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do was listen to the raps in your songs

Lights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)
The boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new
Something new, something new, something new

Straight out the plastic, like a pack of puddings, no show
My nigga, you can not see me, and that's fo' show, fo' do'
Any kind of Cadillac, I go slow
When I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid
Top of the line pine, 'cause I blow big
Been 'round here for a while
Your mama like my style, and so do your kids
I know you love it, because a hater loves to hate
Boy, you need me like a junkie need a razor blade and plate

Cutmaster Swift down your throat, shawty

Boy, stop, Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
Tryna block my shine just ain't gon' happen, so don't try
Every time I get on this microphone I like to spit
Inking hit up after hit, this penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic, now they riding dicks
Like styling on these suckas out here tryna buy their bitch
Now they rich, try convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost, she giving away them drawers
Word to the brown James, he some chicken chow mein
Really mane, you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy, you cuffed, claimed a dame
Hey, my main thang got my last name, know what I mean?

I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

They put Gucci in a cell then Madea went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I need Tyler Perry sales
Loud smell coming out the Lamb', fuck it, what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Guccied down, she got on Chanel
In the cut rolling stupid kush like I'm in a rush
In the club with a half a pound, 150 blunts
Zone 6, East Atlanta's own, fuck with Nia Long
So I shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on
On the block with my stupid watch, boy, you need to stop
When I stop, everybody watch, car don't have a top
In a stretch, cost a stupid check, roll another pack
And I'm gone, I can't even flick, Eastside, where you at? Gucci

I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

Can't be trippin' 'bout no paper 'cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol grip in my lap at all times in the 'lac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can't a nigga stop that
Not when God's got his hands on me, only the strong survive
And the weak-minded are falling by the wayside, they try
But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
With success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, it's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow

Now let's set it straight, B-I-G don't cut for cake
I put her on a plate until she's no longer awake
They just lay fast asleep when I hit 'em with the snake
Put that venom up in 'em until I leave 'em with the shakes
On display, she's a model but she only model shoes
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
How'd she choose? She just whispers in my ear, ""I'm with you""
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby momma out for food
And I also like her throat action with a passion
Love in her mouth for dental satisfaction
That means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashing
Ugh, bust one back in the 'Lac stabbing (Hootie hoo!)
She knows what's happening, there's no reason to doubt it
If you ask her how I got it she say, ""How he had went about it was""

All got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right
They come see me so they can come be freaks
In the backseat, everything fast like a track meet
All I can see are titties, pussy lips, and ass cheeks
Actually, no exaggeration, no imagining
Real talk, my reality is your fantasy
Keisha, Kim, Tameka, Shay, Alisha and Gloria
Chasing this broad tryna find euphoria

As everything outdoors, the kinda girl I describe her
Like Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a jumpman
Top flight security on these hoes, man

When she's liquored up, I'm leaving my fingerprints on her butt
Ten-hut at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy, stop, we think she's coming
Loving the way that I'm licking her down, boy, you bluffing
Nothing, while a nigga like me be straight up royal flushing
But this ain't about playing no cards, dummy
Her get me open my sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me if the coppers caught us riding
To get a tray of fruit and a pack of 1.5s and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze (FIRE!)

And God said look for the burning bush, now I turned to weed
So I jumped in my shell when I saw my momma burning trees
Hard white, I trickle nickel bags
Ice cold true shit, in the booth with blue lips
On your grave like a tulip, in the bar like a pool stick
808 Toomp shit, Magic Mike, poof, bitch
Ain't nowhere to rest, nowhere for you to sit
I stole your couch and I took your truck to move it with
Sofa any one of you wanna get to' up
I'mma tattoo, Kodak you, close up
Ain't no UFO, no, Yela's a supernova

Another day (adabadee, nigga)
I take your pain away

Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down they doubt ya
And when you tip it on the scene, yeah they talkin' bout it
Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it, t-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it
Cause baby whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby, whether you're high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it

See I'm not walkin' on it
Or tryin to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead, yeah
I'm talkin' bout ya
Keep on blaming the machine, yeah
I'm talkin' bout it
T-t-t-talkin' bout it
I can't complain about it
I gotta keep my balance

And I'm still tippin' on it 

You gotta keep your balance
Or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge but I manage
Cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage that
A doctor cannot patch
Why you don't want no friction
Like the back of a matchbook
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you
And your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down
Before we go-go backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low
We gonna get back-up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in an ass crack
Come on

I tip on alligators and little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner
And you know exactly what I mean
Yeah I'm talkin bout you
You can rock or you can leave
Watch me tip without you

N-n-now whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
I'm gonna tip on the tightrope

(High or low)
I got to tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
Now baby tip on the tightrope

You can't get too high
(You can't get too high)
I said you can't get too low
(We can't get too low)
Cause you get too high
(You can't get too high)
No, you'll surely be low
(No, you'll surely be low)

Straight west coasting, you can tell by my outfit
Red 'nati fitted, ""Blood in, Blood out"" shit
Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' the four though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin' logo

Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas they feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin'
Feeling like God's son, the way that it was written

Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I take two hits, and then I pass

I see the cops in the rear view, 
Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill
For real, I think my first album sold five mil'

And you say to yourself that he is broke 
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuittons 
And now that bitch is in the wind and after the next draft, 
She gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him, come again 'cause

[Chorus]

Daddy fat sex, my balls are on your chin, 
But can you tell me where my dick's at?
Gat or ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, 
I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me master
'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, 
We facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Stories and club songs
Black home, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian,
'Cause style's are being loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money while misleading the village

Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers

But I used to flee through that yellow white, yo right
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green
What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream
My nigga let me hit that there hemp, do your thing

Spending cash so fast, you'd think I'm foolish
And I love chicks with ass so it arch like St. Louis
Got chicks hugging my nuts like a speedo
Cause when I'm on the mic, I go for broke like T.O

She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming

Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in

And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better

A quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage
I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat
Said it's the beat of the year
I said El-P didn't do it
So get the fuck outta here

You wanna hang, bring your throat
I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope
Haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk 'cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying ""fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!""

The style is
Radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk
Listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder
You're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers
I'm bored. Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame
And couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war
I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys
Next time do better
Bitch

We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn 'cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors 'cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom 'cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptial agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas

Get mad when a nigga wanna take that knee
But they clap when he catch that ball
These cats nowadays straight pussy I see
They scrap but ain't got no paws
Law break an oath, take his jaw
The biggest liars of them all
I set fire in the mind and the hearts of the men
That wanna clap but it pop off
No excuses, all applause, revolution, all the soft
Restitution ain't solution for the lives that have been lost

There'll be plenty niggas gone
Talkin' 'bout six feet under grass

They hella yellow, they hella yellow
They talkin' tough but they Mellow Yellow
You catch 'em slippin', what's happenin', fella?
Watch they ass go Helen Keller
Can't hear, can't see, can't tell a fella
Lord have mercy, I done prayed
So many days for y'all to try
I've been waitin' to buy ya flowers

Words that I spill
Will lift niggas out of graves while I kill at will
Frozen like ice cubes, chipped like bricks

Hey hey hey
Peace rap world, I'd like to make a special announcement right about now
We have a special guest that just stepped in the house
You know this man, he the smokiest cat in rap music
He goes by the name of the Doctor Greenthumb, smoke 'em out

Now I be, rolling and smoking
And holding the golden sack
When my lungs be getting swollen, hitting the bong folding
For chronic ironic, growing the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic
Smoke Fest, expanding your chest
Buddah bless best, for you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smoking a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you Doctor Greenthumb digits, but don't repeat it
The Brew Crew and the Buddah Masters together
Getting you higher and fucking you up that much faster
Six sacks, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be getting smoked at the Buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin' the stash out, the hash out
I'm rollin' to the studio to smoke my nigga Tash out

Me hiciste creer que yo era para ti todo

Por qué tengo que renunciar a ti

Explícame háblame por qué cambiaste 
Por qué las cosas ya no son como antes 

De un tiempo para atrás he notado algo extraño en ti 
Sinceramente no eres la persona que conocí 
Algo debes ocultarme y no quieres hablarme 
Tal vez por el miedo a lastimarme 

Y no llores por favor mantén la calma 
Sólo quiero escucharte aunque me destroces el alma 
Ya sé por qué en las noches cuando yo te besaba 
Volteabas tu cara y me ignorabas te notaba tan fría 
Tan callada como si nada mientras mi miedo de perderte aumentaba 
Y no me tienes que pedir que te perdone 
Si la verdad se muere en nuestros corazones 

¿Dónde está el amor (amor) que guardabas tú por mi? 
¿Dónde está el amor (amor) pregúntale a tu corazón? 

Nunca me imaginé que esto me iba a pasar a mi (por qué a mi?) 
Si yo fui sincero siempre te comprendí y nunca 
Nunca te mentí yo dormía contigo 
Me levantaba contigo 

Además de ser tu hombre también era tu amigo 
Era tu refugio tu apoyo tu verdad 
Tú fuiste mi sueño hecho realidad 
Y de repente te escapas de mi corazón 

Por qué razón dime por qué razón 
Dónde quedó el tiempo que pasamos dime 
Por favor dime dónde está el amor

Just when you feel like you're out on your own
Just look over your shoulder, you're not alone

When you're in need 
Just call on me 
I'll be your strength
Anytime you're weak
You'll be alright
Just wait and see
I'll be your shelter
Just call on me

There's gonna be rain when you least expect
There's gonna be times 
When you wonder what's gonna happen next
There's gonna be problem after problem that you can't solve
Can't solve at all

Just when you feel like you can never win
Well don't give up and I won't give in

When you're in need 
Just call on me
I'll be your strength
Anytime you're weak
You'll be alright
Just wait and see
I'll be your shelter
Just call on me

Just when you feel like you're out on your own
Just look over your shoulder honey 
You're not alone

Havin' to sleep on the floor,
And workin' from nine to five,

Just here to get some practice,
And now it's only more money and it's more madness,
Stock up on a daily basis,
We travel so many places,
Switchin' so many tricks,
And mixin' up those lyrical faces,
'Cause they see the ice and they trip,
They like to ride in your whip,
But all I want to know is if these girls are riding it, oh!

Who's, who's, who's this?

This is the N A D I A,
You didn't think I was coming at ya,
Givin' you people a different time,

To breakfast first thing
And all them ice and
Jewels that go bling
So you gotta just put
The work in
Cause that's what gets 
Results trust me

Rhythm as we take control
Moving to the beat
Like never before
Click your fingers
And nod your head
Let me know that 
You're feeling this
Stop this, is what I
Hear you saying
Stop this, I'm driving you
Insane I say stop this
Music keeps the vibe when
We live it our timing
It's our way that
We're doing this

Chorus

Bridge

I'm just keeping it real
The same me like
Before the deal
Still rip up beats the
Same street appeal
Still making it hot the
Heat you can feel
People like damn Rocky
Man you need to chill

Now switch the game
Nu Flow was rowdy but
Can y'all do it again
No doubt and even better
Put the raps together
With the R&B everybody 
Telling me

Don't know their names

I don't give a fuck
I ain't got no shame
I got my cash up
So I'm not the same

I'm more thugged out
But I'm not to blame
I need this one
To protect my frame

Niggers that get bread
Gotta have toasters
Or have a thug friend
Whatchin' over their shoulders

Everywhere I go, man
I roll with my soldiers

We takin' over

Don't watch were we hang
don't watch were we bang
Don't watch were we
slang them things
Got that whip with amazing rims just for ladies not gentle men
Hear my song don't get me wrong you can admire but don't
look too long
My thing must look extra
cris 'cause all eyes on me when
I'm on the strip
Looking at me like I ain't shit
Looking at my car like
it ain't my whip
But I'm fucking your
chicks like it ain't my dick
So when they're asking for their
baby daddy I ain't it - shit

So what if I twist a chick
one time then make a switch
Don't watch that
So what if I get my doe on

True your brocking out and that
And the base don't

When you bounce you'll
be leaving out with that
Up in the draws you'll
be skinnin out the cat
If that ass ain't fat don't watch that
Titties ain't all that
don't watch that
Matter of fact, you should
be happy with that

Don't watch that

Some people got rims I got spokes
I'm working with change
They got notes
And I don't know how much
Longer I can cope
I'm about to fall over the edge
I'm in deep way over my head
When I get ten pounds
I make it spread
'Cause that gyro check ain't
Hardly no bread
When your broke like us
You don't joke much
Only window shop,
Look don't touch
Ask the price of stuff
Then say how much
Nah wait there how much?

How long would you last
Without no cash
In this fast moving world
Could you really survive,
All the problems within

Better get moving if you want
That, bread is there for the taking
Better get your share
Monies for making, what I'm
Saying, if you're sleeping
You ain't eating
How you goin to cope if you don't stack those notes you need to learn
To be a pioneer you can find a
Way to make it through the day

Another day, another red letter
From some debt collector
Over something I've done,
Got in debt for
Coming over my house to
Apply the pressure
Yelling through the letter box
“One day we gon' getcha!”
Acting like I ain't home
Till they're gone
Everybody I know's broke
I can't get a loan
I'm trying not to loose focus
Buts it's hopeless
I get served an eviction notice
And the landlord wants
Me out on my ear
Gave me ten days to pay
Or I'm outta here
I really need to clear up my arrears
Before I end up, sleeping
In a park somewhere

To be a pioneer you can find a way to make it through the day

I know suffering I fell your pain
It's hard to keep the
Cheddar coming in
Want to survive, then you've
Gotta stay hustling?
Struggling chasing the doe
Just keep stacking that paper
And making it grow

But I find it hard for me to cope
Even when I'm paid
I'm always broke
I got more going out than
I've got coming in
Can't buy certain things
No bling bling
No 20” rims spinning, just
A sinking feeling
No this can't be living I
Need at least a million

And I feel as though I'm goin
Out of my mind, can't you see
Every time I'm with you I feel weak
Even though we're in a dream, oh I
Can't last a day without
Your touch, your kiss
Gently caressing my body
My body is only for you
Distant love, wish I
Knew how I met you
I know I shouldn't waste
Time wonderin
Is it you who yearns when
I touch your skin
So gentle, so gentle, I can feel you
Tell me
Tell me this is no lie
I see you in the reflection
Of my eyes
If your not here, please
Tell me where

By your here somewhere)

Really what they seem)
When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I want to hold you if only I could show you)
Dreamings not like reality
(Cause you're my destiny
Girl you know)
Need you too
Is this a curse or am I blessed
I think I'm going mad
Up in this cold world
Without my girl
I visualize her daily because I am feeling incomplete without my lady
I see things like her image
Lurking in the mirror
I'm fantasizing, wishing she were right beside me
But realising I am
Dreaming its an illusion
So much confusion
I'm crazy about this lady
You haunt me, I have never met
You but I can swear to god in my dreams I smell and touch you
I long for you want to hold
You when I am lonely
Cause in my heart you're
The only one who knows me
If only I could manifest
Your very being I could show
You a part of me
No girl has ever seen
Believe me you're the only
One in this whole world for me
I know your out there so
Baby girl just wait for me

I know that you're out there

How will I know its you,
So many faces in the world
(Which on belong to you)
Would you pass me by
(If I don't say hi)
Please leave a clue
(I'll come find you and make
Our dreams come true)
I won't hesitate nor wonder,
But please don't make
We wait no longer
(If I had my way you'd be
Here with me, I know its destiny, coz we we're meant to be)

Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin' make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
Our music keeps you movin' what are you provin'?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'm a make you love me baby

And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes

Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows

Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone

Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish

Why don't we just leave them all behind?

I got our friends pissed off and I don't know what to say
When they ask me how I feel I just turn away
I only wanna talk to her about it
It's not their concern

They got their own ideas about the way it should be
How can I tell them what she means to me now?
They'd never understand
And I can't stand any more

Only if you want it 
Yes I really want it 

Can I get an eye open up 
Eazy locin' up 
Smokin' up 
Much dust like a nut what 
Give it up for the real stuff 
Shut the what up 
Back the shut up what 
Hustler from the hood hoe 
Hopin' and mud rub 
The finishin' touches 
Would sure went rubbers 
Comin' in bunches 
Could serve like lunches 
Hold ya horses here's where the source is 
Not very tall but never took a short kid 
With a clip to claw 
Wouldn't draw McGraw 
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw 
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty 
A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy 
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter 
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her 
Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

Here's something from the ding dong cause 
I really care how long ya been strong grown 
Here comes the switch dome chrome 
Couldn't hang with the king 
Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots 
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush 
I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder 
And if I left that means I should of booger 
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks 
I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back 
So I live when I step it's the pimp 
And I rep so make a right and get left quick 
So try to play strong and long gone 
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong 
Get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it. 

[Chorus] 

Ooooooh a new jack! a new jack! 

Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat 
Back back smack, here comes a witty black 
Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why 
Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride 
Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat 
My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one 
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride 
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey 
So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey 
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather 
I see the smilin' faces of while they sick 
Ya know me better, hard Rodney kid 
Gettin' Cali kid, now ya know it boy 
Left up in the alley dead 
Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

But everyone knew of the cause
Hard out of the sun with a vengeance

And yet all of the old ways were gone

But no one can help how they're drawn

In the search for salvation
Looking for remnants of sense
In the end of a nation

Knowing the terror
Would find them much worse than before

In your heart that will not be denied?

That hung so slack, with lips so red
The blooms had withered leaves were shed
Tongues stuck in jaws sad clowns parade
The crushing whine began its call
And pointed fingers at us all

The statues grin

In Angle Park
The fountains crack
In Angle Park

The beaten cry behind white dress
The clowns stuck fast upon the mesh
While mothers wring their hands of tears
The spelling books are in arrears
The evil genuis hugs his wife
As tiles ring with fear of life
The window fills with beating hearts
Beat on blindly beat it all

On a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand
That always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low",Chance [US Version],1983

Pull straws with holy men
Stain all the atlas pink
And let us find a beach
Where we can cross our hearts

Stand in the silence of mountains and
Wear out your welcome again

Piercing the senses that click deep in the night

So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me

Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden

Big Country,"A stranger came by traveling
He went to every door
He said he'd lost his people
He'd come to look for more
And many did believe him
As he talked upon the square
The spell he wove upon us
Fills my body with despair
And in his eyes 
Was the flame of the west
Until it burns
He never rests
He had the voice of an angel
And the face of a saint
And though they fell behind him
I knew what it was he ment
His eyes where full of demons
As he made his message clear
He strode the world like Ceaser
With a trident held as fear
And in his eyes 
Was the flame of the west
Until it burns
He never rests
It's just how it's always been
One man with a ruling dream
And everyone falls for him
Heroines in an ancient film

With a place right where you wanted and the ones to fill it to
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you every day until you need to hit as well
It's just a shadow of the man you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
It all seemed fine for you
Till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche you need a place to run
It's just a shadow of the woman you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
And you have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there's never been a hand
Did we ever have it good
While we lived in Eldorado did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth
It's just a shadow of the people we should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there never is a hand outside that cares
Still the promise comes of living fit for all

Scarred by many knives and too much fear

Leaving alone in a flood of tears
Out on a prospect that never ends
All the landscape was the mill
Grim as the reaper with a heart like hell
With a river of bodies
Flowing with the bell
We built it all with our own hands
But who could know we built on sand
But now it's barren all to soon
There's no miracle in ruin
We set the flame and it burned so blue
With open eyes I watched it grow
A sea of palms in an ocean of snow
Hands with the courage to start anew
Here was a home for the lost and scared
Out of the yards and dry docks
The call of the steel that would never stop
There was a refuge for those who dared
In a steeltown
When the heat's on
I went down
And the heat turned on me
Here I stand with my own kin
At the end of everything

I will run you through my head
In my daily toil
All the promises are said 

I know the weary can rise again
I know it all from the words you send

I will go, I will go
I will leave the firelight
I will go, I will go
For it's now the time is right

I will sing a young man's song
That you would sing 
On Remembrance day
I will be the sacrifice
Bells will ring 
On Remembrance Day

I must leave this land
And the hunger that is here
But the place I stand
Is the one I love so dear

Like a flower in some forest
That the world will never see
I will stand so proud
For I know what we can be

I know the weary can rise again
I know it all from the words you send

I will go, I will go
I will leave the firelight
I will go, I will go
For it's now the time is right

I will sing a young man's song
That you would sing 
On Remembrance day
I will be the sacrifice
And bells will ring 
On Remembrance Day

This day I will remember you
This way, I will always return
(x2)

And I will sing a young man's song....

Big Country,"What would you be if the waves set you free
And the wind in your hair brought you sailing to me
Tied up on the shore would you weary no more?
When will it be, when will it be
What would I be if a hurricane came
Would I be clever, would I be shamed
Would I lie helpless, cast up on the flames
What will I be, what will I be
I will be here forever
Till the river runs into the sea
I will always be silent
And hold my head up
Till we will be sailors no more
Where would we go
To the sand or the snow
Wander in memories or let them all go
Would we be dreamers, helplessly so
Where would we go, where would we go
I will be here forever
Till the river runs into the sea
I will always be silent
And hold my head up
Till we will be sailors no more
I will be here forever
Till the river runs into the sea
I will always be silent
And hold my head up
Till we will be sailors no more
Let's run right out of the city tonight
With our hair tied up and lips sealed tight
I will cry no more, I said I will cry no more
Like an empty tourist at the world fair
I could only stand and stare
And let it pass by me, let it pass me by
I never should have said out loud
That I wanted to save the world
But I let it slip away, I just let it slip away
The only thing I wanted to be
Was the perfect one who killed for free
And I will try no more, I say I will try no more
But now we are together we won't turn back
Where the boats are burned and the ties are black
And I will cry no more, I will cry no more

Big Country,"Long ago I heard a tale I never will forget
The time was in the telling on the bank the scene was set
The sky was rolling blindly on, the daylight had not gone
She washed her hair among the stones and saw what was to come
All this will pass
There will be blood among the corn and heroes in the hills
But there is more to come my boy before you've had your fill
Men will come and rape the soil as though it were their own
And they will bathe their feet in oil as I have bathed my own

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Stones will stand together as if searching for the stars
And all come crashing down again before they reach too far
She turned to face the setting sun, I turned to walk away
But then she called my name again and beckoned me to stay

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

She told me of the famous sons who write their names in peace
Yet be cut down before the time has come for our release
Just as I tell you here
Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen

I listened for so long that day that I can hardly tell
If what she said was heaven sent or brought to bear in hell
That men of hope would stand alone and still be cast a lie
Just as Romans cast them on the day they were to die

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen",Seer,1986

You led me where I had no sight
Till birdsong broke the morning light
And I was weak with strange delight

The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history
You showed me walls around the world
Where seekers passed and flags unfurled
You wove a tale in silken curls
And blew the mist in silver swirls

Seems like twenty five years ago

Got to live it all

And the one I want is in there too

I can be your miracle man
Maybe it's my day
I was always a lucky man
Teach me how to pray

I believe in you
You know it too
You can leave me out
But what I do is what I do

And the one I want is in there too

Wearing the passing of his dignity with all the courage that he can
He stood in the storm, carved out in stone
He said I've worn my honesty with pride in everything I've done

Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around
Where were you when they burned me down

You see her now, all tired and worn
She never thought her life would come to be so cold or so alone
She walked in the light, fought bondage for love
She said I cast off the chains that I was born with but it never was enough

So where were you when my ship went down
Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around

Remove, all the robes worn by sacred ideas
Forget, false accounts of the deeds of brave men

Preaching, with a vengeance so bitter and worn
Meeting, in great halls stained with fierce industry
Ashamed, of the secrets the back rooms have held

Jest now, over acts that you thought to be bold
Call out, with a courage so false that it shakes
Blindness, brought to bear by the years of neglect

Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled

Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche you need a place to run

And there's never been a hand

While we lived in Eldorado did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth

Scarred by many knives and too much fear

Under bridges in a city where the bodies float
And the summer smell keeps the flies remote

Through the swamp of a ghetto where the mission was lost
Where the dope is king and the silver boss
Past the trash and wreckage from the garbage trucks
Past the oil slick where the jail boat docks
To a home in some sea at the nations end
Where the submarine is freedom's friend

And now I'm sure of where I stand

All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
We can be like they are

Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity...
Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women everyday... Like Romeo and
Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Redefine
Happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday...We can be like
They are

Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear we couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared
Saying don't be afraid

Come on baby... And we had no fear
And we ran to him... Then we started to fly
We looked backward and said goodbye
We had become like they are
We had taken his hand
We had become like they are

Come on baby...don't fear the reaper

If you're lost and dying of civilization, that's enough for me
If you believe your own blind eye, you're beautiful people to me
And you may miss what you never had and have what you don't need
And the sun may set without your help, but you're beautiful people to me
You may fall before you're pushed, but it's beautiful people I see
If you only see the stars when it's dark, that's enough for me
An empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me
And the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me
And the finest government you could buy, it's beautiful people I see
If you live five to one against, it's good enough for me
Can't use two steps to cross a canyon, you're beautiful people to me
If you don't see the same trees I see, you're beautiful people to me

Big Country,"The mid-day sky was grey and purple
At least it wasn't blue
I want the sky to be the way I am
And what I do
For I have been a lost and lonely
Sailor on your sea
Run aground by trusting signals
You were sending me

The streets are filled with empty faces
Nothing here is new
It's just the same in other places
I have journeyed to
I was the first across the water
The last across the land
I walked out of the silver mine
My pockets full of sand

Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world

It's not my life in those old pictures
The ones you threw away
For I was always someone else
And always far away
Walking in the darkest places
Where the mission meets
Waiting for the ground to open up
Beneath my feet

Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world

Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world

Big Country,"All the rain came down
On a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand
That always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay

He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Big Country,"I never saw you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through, another season passes by you
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming
Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted

With a place right where you wanted
And the ones to fill it too
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you everyday
Until you need to hit as well

It's just a shadow of the man you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell

It all seems fine for you
Till the struggle of ambition
Turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche
You need a place to run

It's just a shadow of the woman you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell

I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
But frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there never is a hand

Did we ever have it good?
While we lived in El Dorado
Did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger
That should only shine with youth

It's just a shadow of the people we should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell

I know there is enough for everyone
But frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there never is a hand outside that cares

Big Country,"We lay the night in anguish, snakes drawn out by the tide
The compass of decision falls always on one side
But many went before us, and still the cries are clear
There is no beauty here, just the stench of wine and beer
We save no souls
We break no promises
We can do nothing more than move on headlong through the gloom
The thorn between our lips is the missionaries tune
Men with open arms turn their faces half away
Observe as we approach that we have not come to save
We stand as thick as vines though the fruit is torn away
There is no beauty here, friends, just death and dark decay

My love, have you ever seen a
Candy coated Exursion, swang and bang
Still gripping grain
(Northside man huh, Southside what)

[E.S.G.]
See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

[Hook]
[Slim Thug]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

[Hook]
[E.S.G.]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse

We got the braids and fades, and ride 4's and blades
Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

[E.S.G.]
Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast

[Slim Thug]
That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene

[E.S.G.]
In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU

[Slim Thug]
And I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a why-2G bird, valeted on the curb

See them boppers still bopping, them choppers still chopping
Them tops still dropping, the trunk still popping

Tommy Shea

Now Tommy Shea was just 22 years old
Sketchy lanky blonde brave and bold
He walked the strip of Newbury Street in Boston
He never noticed me cause I was a kid and only 10 now
He used to skank it up like I never ever saw
This Tommy kid yeah he fucking had it all
Black boots flight jacket bicked head and all
This kid was a wrecking shop
Yeah he was a fucking wall

Remember when Tommy used to say
Oi Oi
Remember when Tommy used to scream
Oi Oi

I throw my Pac-Man shirt on (I throw my Pac-Man shirt on)
My cordoroys and my velcro on my feet
Because I never knew what was going on (what's going on)
Until I found Boston's own Middle East
Because upstairs downstairs I didn't give a care
I was happy just hearing all the ska blare
A funny thing a thing that made me just so fat so
In 82 I guess it's worth it to take a look back

Remember when Tommy used to say
Oi Oi
Remember when Tommy used to scream
Oi Oi

(Chorus:)
Tommy kicked ass in 82
He kicked ass in 82
Tommy kicked ass in 82
That's right he kicked ass in 82

Hey Tommy where did you go
I wanna find you to let you know
This sketchy song is just for you
I'm not kidding I really wanna find you
Hey Tommy where did you go
I wanna find you to let you know

I'm not kidding I used to wanna be like you

You know who you are
You’re driving fancy cars
Your allowance exceeds my rent

Remind yourselves every day
Let’s get the message on its way 

Well first of all
Fuck your fucking attitudes
How can you be so fucking rude?
You fucking look at me like when girls are jealous
And fuck your fucking L.A. bars
You're all a bunch of wannabe superstars
Yeah, fuck your fucking act
You're a bunch of dressed up fucking rats

You get anything you want

You're fucking lounging in

And all your fucking stupid names

Z-A-see does not spell Zack,
What the fuck is with all that?

You think you're so fucking impressive
If you get your name on a fucking guest list
Raise your nose to the people in line
Give the doorman a fucking high five

And then go:
Do my shoes match my shirt?
Does my shirt clash with my pants?
Do my pants match my eyes?
Do my eyes look good tonight?
Will this place be cool enough?
Your hair looks oh, so tough
This looks so good for us
Tonight my money’s gonna buy me love

And fuck all of your deceiving
What is your fake heart fake fucking bleeding?
And all the girls you lay on your mat
Are the same fucking girls you fucking laugh at
And fuck your fucking fake ass world
And all your handed out fucking thrills

Just to get our little part
And maybe your clan lives right in Boston
But my friends are fucking awesome
And we'll keep on doing our best
Even though our lives are a mess

And we go:
Will this check support this tour?
Will this tour lose my job?
Without my job, where's the rent?
Should we all just call it quits?
And dinner dates sure cost a lot
When 28 bucks is all you got
And your life is at a stop
And all your dreams are all self-taught

And this is the difference between our lives

Your body starts to sweat
It shakes and shivers with fright
You go to sleep with your mother, she hates your guts
She knows that you love her, so she holds you tight 
All through the night into the broad daylight
And when she doesn't come home, you gotta sleep alone

And your plum colored pvc wet-look maxi mac

Which is tickin' me right off 'cause I
Had that cap since I was real-real small.
Then find out just right now
That my main squeeze went through my phone.
0ooooooo...
So I guess I'm single now.
Imagine that!

So I sneak right on The T
The conductor sees me
He's kicking me right off with a frown
I grab my bag and I walk on.
Comm. Ave., I hit up Blanchard's
They sell cheap wine, I got six bucks.
Bag rips, wine smash.
Drink it up avoid the glass!

But I can't help from just smiling
When that damn sun is shinning on
Hell, It's just
Shinning down all over me
No, I can't help but just smile
While that damn sun is shining on
Dang, it's just shining down
Down over me

So now I call up my friend
'Cause his girl must be bored 'cause, see
She's been spreading rumors about me
That I robbed her party, but I never had.
I pull out my little disc man
I bought from a crackhead down in Reno
But my Melt-Banana Cd
Is all scratched up.

I think it's stupid all the people who are moaning
Yeah, moaning on
While the sun is shining down
On our city streets
Even all the things people say
Nah, ain't affecting me
Not when that damn sun 
Is shining down over me.

Shining down on me.

Born to just never care,
Born to just never care,
Born to just never care
About the stupid things
People moan everyday

So later on I meet Johnny Trouble
At a bar called Shay's, a spit from Charlie's
We sit outside talking about girls
How they're loons but we like them anyway.
No money for pints at the bar
We bring a backpack full of Pabst
0ooooooo...
Under the table we fill our glass.

So me and Johnny just sit outside
Warmed by that summer night
While those city stars are shining
Down on our streets
And I just can't help from smiling
While those damn stars are shining down
Yeah those stars are shining
Over our city streets

No, I won't be caught moaning
Not when light is still shining down
And me and Johnny
Warmed by that damn summer heat.
And I can't stop from just smiling
When those damn stars are shining on
Yeah, those stars are shining

I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go

Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it

You better hit bull's eye

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram

Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

The stale cold smell of morning 
The streetlamp dies

Another day is dawning

Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony,1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause

Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know there

Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that

Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign

Big Daddy Kane,"Talk about ever meeting Ms. right
But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac

You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed

You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
[you've got me waiting for you day by day]
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and kane as your man
Bust it, ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you


You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine",The Day You're Mine,1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Hear ye, hear ye, from far and near
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because

Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo

What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But! on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire

Are you sick?
And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and

Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
And we don't even need Scotty to beam us up

Can't forget my man, Lik, y'all in the house
Got Fric and Frac in the house
Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
That's right
And my name is the Biz Markie
And we gon' rock a little something like this

One, two, whatcha gonna do?
I say yes, yes y'all, to the beat, all
Party-having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
H-h-h-hey, we gonna do a little something like this I say

I'm the rap promoter, I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm odor
Put me on water, I'm a good floater
When I run for prez, you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watched Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2-D2 driving down the BQ
When I buy franks, I make sure they're Hebrew
When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nightie that's see-through
Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwartzenegger
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
Peace party people, ha ha see you later
Big Daddy, huh huh, my man my mellow
Get on the mic 'cause you know you eat Jell-O

Check it out, y'all
You don't stop, keep on
Well it's the Kane in the flesh, of course I'm fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten? Huh, I beg your pardon
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance never
Could I be weak, why I'm rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be using and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by picking up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Giving party people something funky to listen to
That's why the other MC's can't swing long
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
Stepping on roaches, I get ferocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Eror, bringing much terror in your era
I'm ready, willing and I'm able, so bust a move
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like thata-the-that, it's like that y'all
'Cause I'm the prosecutor, taking a stand
And, I'm cross-examining you my man
The judge and jury, releasing my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic, nobody's equal

I hate to brag, but damn I'm good
And if mics were a gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done
Lights, camera, action
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step
Now do I come off? Yep",Just Rhymin' With Biz,1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, I'm great!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean me being wack, oh come come now
That's quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, it's on your face, and it's conspicuous
Not that you're on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, that's the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ain't no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, that's ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, nah, don't even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you can't fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man that's here to live long

You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that I'm the Kane, you said ""oh yeah!""
That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh he's def,"" you know what time it is
But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MC's don't understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ain't no joke
I take time and care in whatever I'm doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what you're hearing as I entertain
So hip hip hoolay, long live the Kane

I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now here's my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living?
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say I'm not, don't even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time I'm through
And that's coming from a Black man's point of view

Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MC's, it's a must that I diss you
The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
Now I'mma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
So if we ever battle you're bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No I'm not Chinese, it's just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
You're rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I can't taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I won't stop there, I still rock a little harder

Pardon me a moment as I interrupt. 
For what? 

For this: 
You like the stylish clothes we wear, 
And you like our flat-top style of hair. 
It's just those bugged out things we do 
That make the girles want to stare. 

Like when we're chillin' with the crew.

I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease
'Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making emcees run
Also don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like Sushi
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the a.m.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme
With authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw
'Cause I get raw
I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin'
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten
Or eaten, or just tookin' out
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out
And real nervous, when I'm at your service
Also give me that title boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to
Be perfectly fitted 'cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable
Without a doubt superb
Also full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float, on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get 'em in a battle and make them all history
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin'
Watch 'em all take a fall as I sit back coolin'
On a throne with a bronze microphone
Uh, God bless the child that can hold his own
'Cause I get raw
Chillin', killin' like a villain
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust, comin off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin a sniff
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but Ying Yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world
Could ever come with more, I get raw",Raw [Remix],1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold
Back, or fold cos I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck
Rock the discotheque and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like skippy and jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them
So let's all sing the big daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no
Problem, I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter I'mma still come off
Cos rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what is said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
Cos I get ill and kill at will
Teachin a skill that's real, you're no frill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up

Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad money murf with the triple m
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob lover my brother, scrap lover my other
Dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
From me, so don't play me, obey me
When asked ""who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker mc's headin' north
And if you still want some set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
Cos I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says ""peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it
Big daddy Kane's about to come with it, cause",Set It Off,1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge?
Well I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I?

Proud to be a black man
Coming exact and
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
I say the mother, as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome

The cream will keep rising
We be sizing
Up, the asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm x to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest

People, people
We gotta get over, before we go under
Let's get together
Marley marl
Yo big daddy, what you gonna say now?

Take a stand the fight for power
Cause we've been here before the mayflower
Living superior abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
The teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard
That's word, to the mother my brother
So discover the truth of one another
Cause here's the real deal upon our skin color
Lay down white, yellow, red or pink
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
Peace!",Word to the Mother (Land),1988
Big Daddy Kane,"Here we go, here we go on the smooth side 
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide 
With the source, and of course - I don't want to be the king or boss 
I just want to get my point across 

'Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes 
Realize, we on the rise 
To the climax, time to take charge 
Whoever said we can't live large? 

To seek out fortune without distortion 
And stop livin' for just a small portion 
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break 
All chains become awake 

'Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave 
And I ain't goin out like a slave 
In eighty-nine, I'm livin like a champ 
Step out my face, talkin bout a food stamp 

Child please, put it at ease 
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these 
We can't take shorts or take a loss 
So take it from the Kane and go for yours, because 

[Chorus]

Uh-huh 
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear 
We gotta step up front, to get our share 
Make the change, cause we're not inferior 

For example, there was a black Ms. America 
Let's start to do for ourself 
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health 
So hold your own or else you're gonna find 

That if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemimah 
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive 
To stay alive, that's the reason I've 
Came to, motivate us to the length 

Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch 
Takin' no mediums or small at all 
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall 
What used to be just hopes and thoughts 
Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because 

[Chorus]

Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go 
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go 
One more thing 
Let's unite together, we can't sever never 

No matter what or what-ever 
Because we need unity to find justice 
Just I See Equality so bust this 
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand 

I know we can if we just understand 
The true way of livin that was really meant for us 
So one more time, kick the chorus! 

[Chorus: x2] 

Ah keep it goin y'all 
A Prince Paul, rulin em all y'all 
A Prince Paul, schoolin em all y'all 
And Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony 

And Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone 
Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone 
And you don't stop, and you don't stop 
And you don't stop, and you don't stop..",Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,1989
Big Daddy Kane,"Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm)
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what)
So how we livin'
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Gibbons?
Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)
Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
Cause all the glamor you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of

Another victory

When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it)
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
The first thing they say is ""Where'd you steal her?""
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me
My name ain't Kieth, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready)
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?

Another victory

MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
""Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money up-front
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and (BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever never
Whether, whatever, we better stand together
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin' for

Another victory",Another Victory,1989
Big Daddy Kane,"Well hey, you know that lady on the top floor of my buildin'?
The heavyset one with about ten children?
You may remember her as a slim honey
when her man name was Pimp Daddy Hustler Stack Money
A big time drug dealer from around the way
Slingin' rocks, makin' G's everyday
He drove a big fat Mercedes Benz
and even bought her a car to perpetrate for her friends
It was a brand new Jag, with the spoiler and rag
And the girl was a nag, cause all she did was just brag
I mean bad we know your coat cost a lot
You didn't have to leave on the price tag
And count the times her stomach got plump
Havin' baby after baby by the same old chump
And then the day came, he left the dame shamed
But who's to blame? Y'all know the name of the game
Pimp Daddy's wanted as he maxes and relaxes
She can't even sue for money, pushers don't pay taxes
So what's to do? Oh yeah
To feed ten mouths, she had to call on Mr. Welfare

What? Mr. Welfare?
Man they playin high-post with low income
Check this out when y'all go around to the corner
y'all gonna check out another episode
Go like somethin' like this

Hey, if you think that suck, bust this
Another little story as I reminisce
about an old friend of mine that was livin' out of order
Makin' money like water (ill-egal?) Yeah, sorta
He sold drugs and robbed a lot of people
But in these days and times, who lives illegal?
It's all about who knows the trade
and who am I to knock him? Homeboy was gettin' paid
He chose his own lifestyle to live it was negative
but his own prerogative
Makin' cash to flash and stash in half the trash
The cops made the dash (sufferin' succotash!)
Because he had to do ten in the pen 
and then begin again to apprehend, huh
But what's lost is lost, the reign is over
(Huh, see ya!) Nice to know ya
Money, no longer can he collect it
Can't even get a job cause he got a jail record
So what's left? No hopes of a career
So yeah, he's callin' Mr. Welfare!

Mr. Big Daddy Kane
They don't know what time it is about Mr. Welfare
Do me a favor open up your book to page fifteen
at the top and read it off like this

Here's a story of a guy who had to cop out his life
for bein' a high school dropout
In the ninth grade he wanted to get paid
but now the young brother needs government aid
Because in his past he decided to cut class
and run in the streets to make ends meet
No shame in the game of his
but silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!
So when you sat on the corner with a 40 ounce
talkin' bout what tup? Can't even pronounce
your words correct, now in retrospect
that's a shame but in '89, who gives a heck?
There's no type of path to follow
It's all about a dollar, fuck bein' a scholar
That's why your report card's through
Like a BizMark beat, it reads eww-eww-eww-eww-eww!
So now you wanna wake up and smell the coffee?
Lookin' for a helpin' hand, but get off me!
I tried to tell you the deal last summer
Stay in school, and get yourself a diploma
Now you're on your own, tryin' to make it alone
No food or home, chewin' on a meaty bone
So what's to do since the cupboard is bare?
Brring brring! Call on Mr. Welfare

We-eh-el-el-el, el-el-elllllllfare, c'mon!
Yeah Mr. Welfare
He on some new stuff, what what is it?
He all new and improved?
Right? Yeah, like that old Bug-Out stuff
This guy, is he alright or what?
I think he on a mission with no kind of learnin'
You know what Big Daddy Kane?
We gonna have to take care of this matter
Mister Cee, go ahead, cut it up
My man Big Daddy Kane gonna see about my man Mr. Welfare alright?
Places to go, people to see, things to do
and you know what else to get see ya!
Yeahs!",Calling Mr. Welfare,1989
Big Daddy Kane,"On and on and on and on
Me say the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Nor does the growth of our young world
Yes the children, be buildin, each boy and girl
Cause you are the cream of the planet earth
The new birth, now take that for what it's worth
And give the child room, to blossom and bloom
Livin large, it's your destiny to consume
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
Cause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!)
To start reachin, come on each and every
Single one of y'all comprehend what I'm teachin
I said listen up, listen up, listen up youngster
Learn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya
It's nothin but knowledge, I shall bring to you
And I'm not Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo, but I know

""Children, children"" Where we goin now?
Take my hand my child, and let me show you how
Cause I'm here to help
Those who need Knowledge of Self
Young brothers and sisters, considered the cream
That must rise to the top and fulfill the dream
And there are desires that we all want to achieve
But remember, respect is most greatest to receive
And we don't have to gain it by bein TOUGH
Or sellin our own kind that cooked white stuff
So bring your negative mind from out of the shade
Find your true self and let's all get paid, because

People, people, why we live illegal?
Your life just ends short and you know that there's no sequel
(sequel) They'll say that it was fun while it lasted
You run wild, stickin up and gettin blasted
Pregnant girls livin solo, on the welfare
Cause your so-called man said go to hell dere
And young brothers that could be tryin to rap
Instead, are out boostin clothes at the Gap
Now what kind of life is that for a child?
Runnin wild livin foul, hey, change your lifestyle
Get some knowledge, and open your eyes
Just take a little bit of time
How fully you'll come to realize, that

I believe the children are the future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all of the beauty they posess inside
Give them, a sense of pride
To make it easier, let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be",Children R the Future,1989

With nothin' to gain under the Wrath of Kane
Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or path or road, until the next episode
That the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
Or be funky like a underarm
And allow me to show how the microphone should flow
Now, competition bow, to me like a Buddha
The teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin' or crabbin'
So save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin'
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
Get loose, now put a boost and used to chill
The comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice

I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
Cause you're useless, makin up excuses, excuses
So never touch, tap, tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'mma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin wild just ain't my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
Quiet as kept, not like a star to you
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin' to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child you shouldn't even bother
To press up, and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow
And smooth to the groove with lyrics that soothe
And improve with every move, that's why you've
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football, and let's go the nine
Shorts I take none, cause I ain't the one
In '89 there's damage being done
And for you to diss me, will be very risky
Cause I make this be, as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose and fall
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
Superior, cause I ain't even hearin' ya
Save the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang

In other words, protect and hold your own

Fists of fury, suckers get buried
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothing could save ya, from catchin' the vapors
Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
And I'm rubbin' em in just like vicks say I'm
Captivatin, dominatin, innovatin, illustratin, fascinatin'
Motivatin, elevatin, terminatin, mutilatin'
Rhymes they're worth their weight in
Gold, bold, never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage, don't tell me what another do
Cause I quote that I'm r-a-w
So make room, cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume, and make your own tune
A grave from a casket, a tisket a tasket
You're rhymes out of basket, boy you get your ass kicked
For frontin' like you hittin' hard
When your arms are too short, to box with god
So don't even touch cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle
He must be senile, and that's why meanwhile
Back at the ranch
There goes the asiatic chosen one that's expandin' with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat

You say daddy I don't want none

I seize and freeze MC's with these degrees
Put me to my knees, or at ease, chill'd please
I break it down, to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit, they need ex-lax
So stop griffin, your mind is driftin'
Prepare yourself cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you can't understand
At times I gotta say to myself, ""god damn!""
As I get hot, and still be gettin' warmer
And I don't have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker!
Frontin' mc's that be tryin' to rip
Need to save it, and don't even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin'
I step to you and say, ""now what's up?"" then
Every word'll be just like surgery
Cuttin' you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and below
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
J-o-k-e-s ain't my style
I ain't a child that's why I don't smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine the other rappers resign
As I go on, from night to morn
Beginning to end, from knowledge, to born
Whenever rappers are lookin' for static
Looks like a job for king Asiatic
An-y, send-me, competitors
Then again, it might just be better to
Just slow down you don't wanna throwdown
I get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round
Feel the wrath of a big daddy duel rhyme
And competition, prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat

You say daddy I don't want none

I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin black gold
So let it be said, let it be read
Cause I lead ahead, of others who rhymes are old as pro-keds
Tryin to diss the big daddy repetoire
Moi?
You steady screamin' out a antique segment wrote
As I just play em like a pregant roach and stomp em
For tryin the forbidden
Your rhymes ain't hittin', boy you won't be gettin'
None of, or in front of, cause every one of
My adversaries, lack, you little son of
O-bit-uary column, and read your name
If you ever try to step to the big daddy Kane
So any claimin' or aimin' to be champion
Against me? psh, can't be one
I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause there's only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise man'll reach ya
I teach freedom, justice, and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves, from mental death in power
That's the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the nation of Islam

Big Daddy Kane,"Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because were on the move

Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up
The slow ones need to pep up to keep big daddys rep up
Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff
The big daddy got more than enough good stuff
Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'
Strong enough for a man but made for women
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky

It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
>from the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neah don't hurt
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, g
You're not a jungle brother, but that's some jimbrowski
Im like a pimp, see, and if you tempt me
I can fill up any girls that's empty
Give you somethin' that's mighty and strong
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love em and leave em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia
But the party people cant be denied
So I remember those who's on my side

Now, I'm-a take a sip, now its time to bounce
I wont get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk
Cause im one hype, one brown-skinned brother
For those who dont know me, I'm (who? ) scoob lover
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow
For all the choice cuties, id love to say hello
So take away the 3, lets stick to 1, 2
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do
It begins with an s and ends with an x
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess whats next
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
Cause its about time for scoob to get ill
Remember you dissed, now you wanna kiss
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss
There's only one rap dance, the cool romancer
If I had a million dollars, id try to cure cancer
But im only here to get illey, ha
Now, im drug free and I dont smoke phillies
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40
And make sure its cold so the crew can get naughty

You get jacked if you ever try to nap
Ona a rap from scrap because you know there's no haps
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off
Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say
You cant mislead me why cause I know the way
Always gave headahces, never known for heartaches
Time and effort, huh, thats what a star takes
Let me give you a true piece of mind
Cause this rare species is so hard to find
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles
No remarks or regrets, but ill burn while
Those thats destined to question for a new thing
Join us in harmony together as we sing
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now cause

Twelve, thirteen, start your age; 

fourteen-fifteen-sixteen, the pubic stage 

Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum 

better get off the virgin before I cuuuuum! 

Pick up my pants and thump and thump 

I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some 

Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum 

I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a 

'Specially if the hoochie's on birht control-a 

Lift her up just like a pick up truck 

then I sat her down and we started to fuck 

Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, YO-O-O-O-O! 

I hope this time I don't make a cookie 

Brothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie 

Two from the Greg Nice from the o-o-old schoooooool

Here is a bachelor comin' straight at ya 

I see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it 

the Big Daddy law is anti-faggot 

That means no homosexuality; 

what's in my pants'll make you see reality 

And if you want to see a smooth black Casanova -- BEND OVAH! 

'cause I don't half-step when it comes to broads 

The K-A-N-E 'll go the whole nine yards 

There's no time for coversation my dear 

[MOAN!] is all I want to hear 

So let's make a move, as I get smooth 

'cause the purpose I serve is to soothe 

I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk 

Even white girls be sayin' ""Ooh, Kane's a hunk!"" 

Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi 

Some try to copy, but they look sloppy 

So imitators who want to step to a 

brother like me, lick my manure! 

Chorus 

[Smooth B] 

I'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo 

and when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Hoe 

But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-see-E 

and if the girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee 

I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree 

that when it comes to pimpin' hoes...it ain't easy 

First name: Smooth. Last name: be	 

WHen I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly 

I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg 

and when I take off my clothes, the I form a third leg 

They rub it with oils and suck it with ice 

Now I'm sweating....my mind is in paradise... 

Chorus 

[Scoob Lover] 

Tip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein' 

Braggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin' 

buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin' 

right in front of me...mmm...not even knowin' 

A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty 

Nametag earrings readin' off ""Tootie"" 

Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams; 

from my eyesight that was what it seemed 

I said, uh, ""Come a little bit closer"" 

To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said ""Hi 

Hi...hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you 

I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you 

How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?"" 

I said, ""Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate"" 

So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder 

went for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older 

East to the Benz, I slowly walked; 

clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk 

Sex in my mind, I was sure of it... 

I wanted to tax that ass like the government!

This must be what you call, love at first sight 
When you commit yourself to someone 
And don't even know wrong from right (wrong from right) 

Looks like my feelings been united with you baby 
But maybe just a little bit too soon 
I realized that hearts get broken, sweetheart 
I couldn't stand the wound (can't stand the wound) 

So I put mines in your hands girl 
And it's all yours my dear 
But you got to be gentle, cause it's fragile see 
That means handle with care (handle with care) 

Hey, reminisce on how I first met you 
You remember -- backstage at my show 
I thought that I was the star until I saw you 
(but I did not love her) (I did not love her) 

Escapin from the crowd to be alone witchu 
'Cause I had oh so much to say 
As we sat down in my dressin room girl, huh 
And just talked the entire night away 

From that moment on I felt that I knew you 
Just like the back of my hand (I love you, I love you) 
Loved you like I never loved another (I loved you) 
And dreamt of bein your man 

[Repeat: x2]
How would it feel? To be your man?

Just think of the first time that we went out to the movies 
When we went to see that picture 
Iahhhhhh, I was the on the first thing smokin 
Just to fly that head to getcha (I gotta getcha) 

And what about the time that I called you long distance 
On my car telephone (and I was alone) 
Now that's what I call reachin out to touch somebody 
At a million dollar zone 

But you see, it didn't matter sweatheart, nah baby 
'Cause I'd call Mars for you 
Climb the highest mountain to be by your side 
Word to MOTHER, cause my love is true (my love is true) 

Girl, if you could just understand (try to understand) 
All the things that I'd do 
Just for the sake of me, Kane, bein' your man

How would it feel? To be your man? 

Do it to em Blue Magic!

How would it feel? To be your man? 

So what you sayin' baby? 
So what you sayin' baby?

Can I be your man? (I'll be good to you) 
So good to me..

Big Daddy Kane,"Come, get some, you little bum 
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb 
From the poetic, authentic, superior 
Ultimate, and all that good shit 
I'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic 
There you have it, now get dramatic 
Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene 
And I pack em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen 
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile 
Put on trial a rap pile to exile 
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just CRUMBLE 
And I'm still calm and humble 
You need another helpin hand to swing on 
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on 
Your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey 
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me 
And if may make this one thing here clear 
That's for you not to come near, PERIOD 
So I ain't buggin or delirious 
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is 
And I can slice and dice a Fisher Price MC 
That thought he was nice into Minute Rice 
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff 
'Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff 
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage 
But in my own way of doin damage

Take two other men with soul that you probably know 
Deadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby show 
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush 
They step to me, but can't stop the bumrush

The unique technique I speak is all original 
You like to sag and drag and gag 
Same old same old, but Poppa's Got a Brand New Bag 
So put the mic down boy, you can't work it 
Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit 
So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse 
You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust 
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture 
You moved wrong my son, so I taught ya 

Just like a guardian, that put your body in 
The mood to groove with the smoove way that I'm partyin'
Competition may find it spectacular 
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
and waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here 
So come near if you dare, you BOOGA BEAR 
You start hallucinatin' like Magic 
The wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it
Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'
So pick a VC date, cause you're history 
Here comes Kane Scoob Scrap Jay and Mister Cee 
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to 
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo

Big Daddy Kane,"Can I see the peace sign up in the air?
You know what this is?
The wrath of Kane, takin' over your circumference
Destroyin' negativity, and suckers that come with
the weak, the wack, the words, they're poor
I thrash bash clash mash and ten more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremer, see
You need a savior to save ya, so lean on me
I'm playin' rappers like a haunted ghost
and stomp em out like a watered roach
I slay my pray and they decay, I blow away and throw away
so go away, cause I don't play
Attackin' like a psychopath breakin' rappers in half
so feel the wrath of Kane!

The man at hand, to rule and school and teach
and reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most, and boast the loudest rap
Kane'll reign your domain!
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let us beat around the ball like an Astro
Then send em to jail for tryin' to pass Go
Shakin' em up, breakin' em up, takin' no stuff
but it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow
so I can flow, now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
and Doug E. Fresh, Stet', KRS and Public Enemy
Blase blah, you know who you are
The red black and green, the sun moon and star
Knowledge of Self, degree of twenty-one after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
with the speech every leecher I'm impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blind'll feel the wrath, of Kane!

Marley Marl break it down!

Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I got a rap ta
those who chose to oppose, friend or foes I still dispose
Blow em out like afros
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yellin' and screamin' and jeerin' but still came out
Off the wall as butter soft-er y'all
So you waited for Kane, to come after all
competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
to play me out position, you on a mission
But stop lyin' and tryin' to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
Bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
rhyme or find the time to design a line
or phrase that pays, so you down in rhyme
I get busy from sun to sun
Only twenty-one, untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes I keep em runnin' like pantyhose
They got soft and tender, front and they'll surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on the trial, war be my style
but when I'm in effect, they feel the wrath, of Kane!

Alright, pump your fists in the air like this y'all
C'mon let me see the fists in the air
C'mon y'all
And let me hear you say yeah, c'mon
(yeah)
C'mon now, yeah, c'mon!
(yeah)
Everybody, yeah, what?
(yeah)
yeah, c'mon
(yeah)

And say hoe-oh (hoe-oh) hoe-oh (hoe-oh)
Say yo baby, yo baby, yo
(Yo baby, yo baby, yo!)
And just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
If you're gettin' cash money and not welfare
Somebody say, ooh yeah! (ooh yeah!)
Ooh yeah! (ooh yeah)

Big Daddy Kane,"So out of the mercy of Allah
And the LAW, written in our nature
We call an individual, into existence
And when that individual, I make, NO apologies
For what I'm about to say

Rough, rugged and real, you're on standstill
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Rappers I replace, rub out, and erase
Competition you must be on freebase
Smokin' or chokin', bound to be broken
Man, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm chokin!
Cause I got a strangehold
You're still cold off the road for the role you stole
Rhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out
Crossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out
I'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller
I'm a rebel, blessed, able to hold a
Mic like a hammer, and drop grammar
Treat a rapper like a wrestler, and body slam him
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
So just PLAY mute, don't even whisper
Open your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya
Ragtag and dog, put you in the morgue
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady
In other words, you're half-steppin'
Tiptoein', get goin', because my weapon
Is not a nine, an Uzi or a shotgun
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
Long Live the Kane ain't a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
We sample beats, you sue and try to fight us
Man, you still be home with arthritis!
If we didn't revive em, bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand, the way that I live
That's positive - and the message I got to give
It's a benefit for you and me
I'm talkin' bout P.E.A.C.E
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef
No pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish
The Kane fallin' victim? Sucker, you wish
I flow like water, slaughter
Put you out of order floored ya!
Rappers are raggin' and taggin' and snaggin' and braggin'
To be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just get back, I'm young, gifted and black

And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sendin' this out to Divine Force
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast
Can't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two

Big Daddy Kane,"Here I am, R-A-W 
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
Phoney emcees, I move on and seize 
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease 
'Cause I'm at my apex and others are below 
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
Second to none, making emcees run 
So don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one 
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol 
And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt 
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi 
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me 
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem 
Cold rock a party, until the A.M. 
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle 
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme 
With authority, superiority 
And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues 
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw 
'Cause I get raw

I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin' 
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten 
Or eaten, or just tooken out 
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out 
And real nervous, when I'm at your service 
So give me that title boy, you don't deserve this 
I work like a slave to become a master 
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to 
Be perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed 
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it 
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya 
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb 
So full of action, my name should be a verb 
My voice will float, on every note 
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote 
The minute that the Kane starts to go on 
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing, so on 
As I put other rappers out of their misery 
Get em in a battle and make them all history 
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin' 
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin' 
On a throne, with a bronze microphone 
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own 
'Cause I get raw!  

Twenty-four-sev' chillin', killin' like a villain 
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing 
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never 
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must 
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd 
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred 
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin' a sniff 
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff 
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic 
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic 
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive 
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected? 
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior 
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I 
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang 
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang 
So if we battle on the microphone 
Bring your own casket and tombstone 
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world 
Could ever come with more, I get raw!",Raw [#],1989
Big Daddy Kane,"Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on first htey're guilty now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this TV
All this news and views are beneath me
Cause all I hear about is shots ringin' out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hand out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

Ice cube is down with the P
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big daddy is smooth word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roamin' through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb gettin' played like a sucker
Don't fight the power  the mother fucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood boulevard
Thinin' how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portrayin' the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
When on the screen
Like a guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And black women in this profession
As for playin' a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like spike lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
There's nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn",Burn Hollywood Burn,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"""I was born..""

[Big Daddy Kane]
A black man from the motherland
Speakin a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the U.S.A.
A young brother, made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?
""I was born..""

A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me, a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top twenty or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin' cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so
Conjunction junction, what's your function?
Bein' a scout, or sellin' out?
Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye
And say: who am I?

[Gamilah Shabazz]
A solid change, have to rearrange this strange
Feelin' I'm feelin', so appealin'
I am having to deal with
Time to forget the myth, of bein' black and a woman
Can't get ahead, walkin' on a thread, a tightrope
Can't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope
Runnin' your scope on affairs
You have to be aware, don't flare up
Let your cup runneth over
I'm not Irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish
Nor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far
Anyway I'm thinkin' about today, not tomorrow
I'm not a follower of anyone
My time has come, it's already here
My message is clear
Like the women of long ago, I am also here
Also to show, I have the courage
Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity
No matter the life, length of time
Show me a sign, should I rely on a
Subliminal message, should I question
What would seem to be, life's told me?
Yes indeed, so let me speak

[Big Daddy Kane]
And that's comin' from the daughter of Malcolm X
So black women put it in your texts
So you can never let, opportunity pass you by
Or even ask yourself, who am I?",Who Am I,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"Mmm oh yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, ohh yeah

Allow me to introduce myself
As the big daddy kane
A smooth lover from around the way
That's bound to drive any bitch insane

Well dolemite is my name
And rappin' and tappin' is my game

Oh yeah? well me tell you somethin' mr. dolemite
The shit you talkin' years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me

Listen when it comes down to rappin'
I was through with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the king so I'm stakin' my claim
In the rappin' game
Y'know? for all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin' up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin' down broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said, ""I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin' like you ain't never seen!""
I said, ""lady! why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been wantin to tear up yo' old gray ass""
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The ho took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That, ""oh mr. dolemite, take that motherfucker out!""

Well you ain't sayin' nothin' slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from new york to dallas
Won for pimp of the year at the caesar's palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the atlantic ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin' money before washington was put on a bill
And I kicked jack's ass and took his ho jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say fuck mcdonald's and call me the big mac

Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin' but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw thunder's ass in jail

Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin'
I'm the one that put the m in mackin'
Because when you did it you was only actin
I made pimpin' a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of new york hot as a sauna
And hung a home sweet ho sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to excedrin and knock the shit out of ex-lax

Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
Rat soup eatin' motherfucker!!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin' game
I was callin' whores jives ass bitches
And pimps sucker ass lame
Kane, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from new york to los angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be born blind and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the pocks in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the air
And get out and do the runnin' man while you up there
Have the mumps and the asiastic flu
And the crabs around yo' ass start singin' the yankee doodle doo!

Aww fuck it I give up",Big Daddy Vs. Dolemite,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"Move over bacon there's somethin meatier 
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya 
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over 
'Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova 
I'm not tryin to say that I'm number one 
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done 
So, let me lick you from head to toe 
Real slow
'Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung 
Just by the movement of my tongue 
I remember it all started way back 
In umm...Kindergarten!! 
Some played with Lego's, some played with Play-Doh 
But I was feelin girls like a ripe tomato 
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk 
Lockin up girls like I want 
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em 
I collect em like Playdium and mmm, you gotta see em 
Because the ladies is all I dream of 
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right [x4]
Yes I can! 

Step up girls and get somethin to treasure 
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure 
And if you're wonderin if I want it
I got a Kraftmatic with your name written on it 
I reminisce sayin I take em eight to eighty 
But I was just kiddin, no you have to be a lady 
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body 
I just don't go to a Similak party 
So all those of age, we can get intimate 
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent 
I treat girls just like pastry 
Mmmm tasty! 
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky 
A well known player, but not for the Yankees 
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role 
But I'm up to top two and my father's gettin old 
I'm takin love to a brand new height 
And if lovin girls is wrong I don't want to be right 
'Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime 
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right [x4]
Yes I can! 

If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit 
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it 
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack 
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her 
And bring about that feelin of passion 
To have her on my body like modern day fashion 
Layin next to me, in pure ecstasy 
You're like a door and you know that sex the key 
So send your man to the lost and found 
I'm bringin somethin that's world renowned 
In other words - good lovin that's major 
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager 
Runnin around sayin, ""Please me, please me, please me"" 
That's why I say it ain't easy 
But I've been able to maintain my status 
With ladies mackin without ifs ands or maybes 
And other players just can't understand it 
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded 
I always end up with them on my shelf 
I gotta jump back and kiss myself 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right [x4]
Yes I can!",Cause I Can Do It Right,1990

Swing your partner, I'm about to start the 
Dance across the land, the Kane will scar the 
People of our community, cause we're soon to see 
The future of the world to be without unity 
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history 
To reveal what's been hidden a mystery 
Because we're headed for self-destruction 
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when 
One black brother sells another one dope 
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope 
Many of us live on this level 
Mislead victims who dance with the devil

Guns are bein bought over the counter like candy 
Comin in handy for chumps to act manly 
Once before they were only for the law 
But no more for sure, lookin at a L.A. gun war 
Even in Brooklyn, lives are bein tooken 
The Bronx is dyin while the box is steady cookin 
Capsule after capsule, settin a trap to 
Destroy all our kind without a hassle 
I couldn't kill my brother, about a color 
Or cocaine, not even over a rope chain 
In this world I'm considered a rap rebel 
To correct those who dance with the devil

There's no survival 
Bodies come in D.O.A, Dead On Arrival 
Everytime someone ships in artillery 
Begins the game wonderin who will the killer be 
There's no war, so the Navy must want to see 
Drugs and guns shift into our country 
So we can shoot each other and sell each other death 
And imprison all the other ones left 
So it's time to start to rise 
We can't be uncivilized, we gotta realize 
That bein the baddest doesn't matter when your life is had 
So let Michael Jackson be Bad
No time to devestate, we gotta elevate 
To a higher level.. than dancin with the devil

Lookin at the fall of our new generation 
Makes me wonder about the Emancipation Proclamation 
We're considered to be free, but did slavery devour 
When we're still slaves to mental death and power 
Misled and unknowin, people are goin 
More and more beneath, instead of growin 
Express Yourself, was said by N.W.A. 
So stop givin trouble a play 
Because those who chose to oppose never rose they all froze 
At thirty-two degrees to enemies 
That already tricked em and made em fall victim 
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, just look at them 
What we need is peace and love and more love 
But I don't see none of the above 
So one for the bass and two for the treble

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Attention to the whole crew
Scoob Lover, Scrap Lover, I don't need your dancin
Mister Cee I don't need you on the turntables
Ant Live I don't need you collectin the dough
And Little Daddy since you my brother
get yo' ass on in here
Cause we gettin ready to take things down the line
Here we go one time
Prepare yourself for MC terror
And don't make the error of tryin to come near a
rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
to grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like
Vincent Price, but you never been so nice
So back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice
Kickin ass in every committee, city to city
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Plus an imitator assassinator
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Hard as concrete, and always on beat
Steppin to this, you're not allowed
You keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd
Snatchin the microphone real proud
But your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud
So next up down the line, Scrap Lover
[Scrap Lover]
Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
a toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
there's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
is smashed, for that reason you have to
make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the see, the are-A-P
stands for me, cause I'm the
only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover
[Scoob Lover]
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S why'all, to the see why'all, double-O be	 why'all
Well god damn it's me why'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi..
.. at a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin?
You be hopin wishin and prayin
to be like Scoob but what are you sayin?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee
[Mister Cee]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin a massacre, you couldn't last through a
round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'ma tear shit up
So next up goin down the line
The Little Daddy Shane
[Little Daddy Shane]
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D why
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live
[Ant Live]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
A 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive..
And my name is Ant Live
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now that's what I'm talkin bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And we outta here, love peace and hairgrease",Down the Line,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"Uh! Put your weight on it 
Uh, and uh, Prince Paul, bring me on and uh 
Aiyyo Botch, bring me on and uh 
Mad Money Murph just bring me on and uh 
Just bring me on, yo 

This is a world premier and I'm here 
A presentation beyond compare 
So MC's step to the rear as I break through 
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo 
That means dance as I get smooth with 
Poetic perfection that you can groove with 
Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seat belt 
'Cause I'm about to start broadcastin' 
The words of wisdom, so turn up the system 
Loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one 
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred 
The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occurred 
As I break MC's like a lumberjack 
Ain't no comin' back, you can't get none of that 
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful 
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal 
'Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any 
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me 
With the mic in my hand I start flowin' then 
All competition flee and start goin' in 
The other direction, run for protection 
'Cause I can burn an MC like an erection 
You're too small kid, don't get involved with 
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam 
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod 
Showin' I got the power, and that's from bein' born the God 
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self 
But they're just illiterate, so I don't consider it 
Feedin' off poison that's pollutin' their mind 
And that's the reason I don't swine 
I gotta maintain, accelerate my brain 
And god damn, it's hard being the Kane 

Give it to me! c'mon! 
C'mon! Uh! 
Give it to me! Give it here! 
Give it to me! Yeah

This is the proper way man should use ink 
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct 
Just like a dinosaur, but you never find a more 
'Cause mine'll keep sellin' on wax like some kind of whore 
Let me inject this, flow of electric currency 
For all the party people preferrin' me 
And spectatin' like a tourist, cause you never 
Saw this style of rap kickin' like Chuck Norris 
But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you 
A style, that phony MC's were too young to 
Digest, when I manifest, you adolescent 
So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson 
And this one's for your listenin' pleasure 
Somethin' for all the bitin' MC's to treasure 
Just like a diary, for you to admire me 
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society 
Cool as a draft, droppin' math in a paragraph 
I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff 
But many MC's were able to retreat 
Runnin' like an athlete, but I got bad feet 
So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya 
Nah it ain't in my nature 
I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped 
As I manifest in hip-hop 
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck 
And just like lightnin' they struck 
Down on all the toy MC's that annoy 
That's how I build and destroy 
The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor 
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into 
So I'm advisin' competition to flee 
'Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee 
Holdin' my own on the microphone 
'Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones 
So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain 
God damn, it's hard bein' the Kane! 

Give it to me! Get up! 
Come on! Uh! 
Give it to me! Come on! 
Give it to me! Yeah! 

Put in a pause, because here's the holocaust 
Above all laws, in effect and all yours 
'Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace 
A replace, erase the waste without a trace 
My vocabulary will just have you very 
Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary
That means competition 
They can't even touch this, even with ammunition 
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage 
And I'ma still blow up the stage 
'Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get 
In the way of your vision don't be missin' when I get set 
To go on a rampage, start a one man rage 
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage 
And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin '
To prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in 
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow 
And so 
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried 
To get fly and face the ace I put em in place 
Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em 
And all the rest of that good stuff, 'cause I don't need em 
Only one survivor can remain 
And god damn, it's got to be the Kane! 

Get up! Give it to me! 
Give it here! c'mon! 
C'mon! Give it to me! 
Uh! Put your weight on it",It's Hard Being the Kane,1990

Give it to me

Get on the dance floor
Start to clap your hands for
The smooth operator, what more can your ask for
The musical maestro
That's usin the mic so
I can spark up the entire place like nitro
Glycerine because the crowd is sizzlin'
Bobbin they heads to what's said and still listenin'
I specialize in fun
And I must know what's happenin' cos you're dancin' like re-run
So behold the natural born soul, a rhythm
To get em and hit em as I party with em
My job is to make you all feel this
But I'm not don cornelius
I'm just a new black cesar here to please ya, ease ya
Movin' and groovin', provin', soothin' at your leisure
I don't sing or yell
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than ma bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
You think dancin' is irrelevant
And start stompin' like a elephant
But that's not necessary, just let the beat carry
You into somethin' funkadelic
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
I gotta keep em on the floor

Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin' sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(give it here)
Get on up and dance
(funky)

Look
You came in the disco
Thinkin' it would be just low
But I'ma make sure you enjoy this show
You won't have a chance to sit down
(get down)
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
A voice that's choice, as strong as sarah vaugh
Swift delivery flowin' like a river be
Flowin', but only ladies know my tongue is that slippery
I grab the mic and then we'll see
Who can d-a-n-c-e
Makin' the crowd roar for more of what they saw
And I'm sure that I can keep em on the floor

Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin' sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(give it here)
Get on up and dance
(funky)

Oh
Feel like I'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
You're ready

So I'ma let the music just stop
And we gon' get into our own thing for a minute here
You're ready

Break it down

Keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')

(Dance)

Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
Cos I can feel the disco heat gettin' to me
While the sweat got my silk drawers stickin' to me
But I can't stop, I gotta party
Like a gun on the dance floor and catch a body
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As I make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
So let's try this, stop the violence
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
A little love and harmony mh (it's the joint)
So build a nation, pump the bass and
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the big daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is keep em on the floor

(Everybody get up)",Keep 'Em on the Floor,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"Mmm mmm, yeah
Oh I like this
I wanna tell this story
A little story about umm
A brother who you would think has everything goin' for himself
But apparently for some reason he just ain't happenin'
I call this brother mr. pitiful
I wanna tell you somethin' about him, check it out

The story begins in 1984
When I met the biz markie out in front of the store
He used to tell me all the time, ""yo your lyrics is hype
We got to get together and make a record of some type""
I said, ""man, the hype behind run-d.m.c. and cool j
What the fuck makes you think they're gonna give us a play?""
We did a few shows together, freestylin' on stage
Manhattan and long island, for mike and dave
After that, I was convinced we can do it
Until my man biz jetted and came out with ""make the music""
From right there, I said, ""man, this shit is real
Look at biz in the new leather and a pair of spot bills""
I got to give it to you dukes, I was wrong
Well you out there now, so put my black ass on
And sure enough, huh, in about a year's time
I was r-a-w, goin' for mine
Droppin' jams that slammed on every radio program
And bam, got damn, look where I am
The first album, long live the kane, it sold
About umm aww fukkit it went gold
The money was comin' in, yes I had done em in
It wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then
Cause I was in demand for lots of fans
A sexy chocolate guy in the public eye
I bought myself a condo out in queens
A plush white volvo and drove off the scene
But I remained the same since I moved out
For instance drinkin' olde e and guinness stout
And also, hangin' out with the troops
Most of all, takin care of ma dukes
Then all of a sudden things started to change
And many old friends started actin strange
Behind my back, sayin' I'm soft and a sucker
Some even said, ""yo let's rob the motherfucker""
And family members askin for my papers
But biz set them straight, by makin' ""the vapors""
Girls cryin' pregnant, to get some of my green
I'm like, ""what the fuck is this? billie jean?""
People harassin me, steadily askin' me
Dis or dat, some even had the audacity
To say that I only liked light-skinned women
Tchk, huh, are you kiddin'?
Cause I love everyone
And I never act prejudiced to none
But for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical
That's why they call me mr. pitiful

A few people know what I'm sayin'
Hmm, to the little daddy shane, you know what I mean
And to my man cool v, you know what I mean
To t.j. swan, you know what I mean
And to scoob and scrap, you know what I mean
To rob base and e.z. rock, you know what I mean
The magnum force, you know what I mean
And to the playboys, you know what I mean
To shemp shawn, you know what I mean
And the f.m.c., you know what I mean
Can't forget miv, you know what I mean
Godfather d, you know what I mean
My man doug e. fresh, you know what I mean
And the fifty dollar crew from canada know what I mean
But most of all I can't forget my man biz-mar-kie
And may I send this to a.j. quest, rest in peace",Mr. Pitiful,1990

Hey, you know, [Name]
I'm findin it very hard to understand
The lifestyle of young ladies today

[Male voice]
Yo, they're hard to figure out, gee
They need a sincere leader
{Big Daddy Kane:}
You know, I've heard it said

You gotta use what you got to get what you want
But I think they're usin a little bit too much when they flaunt
You know

[Name], you know, ehm
I don't understand the way these girls is rolling today, man
How about you, man?

[Male voice]
Yo, let me tell you somethin, gee
If they ain't lying they tryin to do some other - wildness

[Big Daddy Kane]
I know, I know
It's like girls promisin you Thomas's
And can't even cook toast, right?
What I'm tryin to tell you, man, is...

They just ain't no damn good
No damn good
Check it out

Now there's this girl named Monique
The type of female that you consider a freak
A big-time player playin like a drum beat
You think her address is 21 Hump Street

She step out every night to swing
With her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring
Bamboo earrings all big and lookin silly
With extensions hangin down like Milli Vanilli

And every Wednesday night at the Apollo
First kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow
And Monique would be ready to sleep
With the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep

Strung out and givin up the nappy dug out
You're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out
So here, nympho, here's some good info
Stop takin em putts and close your legs, toots

'Cause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm
I once was infatuated by the things that you do
But now you're doodoo
It's all about respectin yourself

In order to gain respect from anyone else
Treat yourself like a real woman should
'Cause bitch, you ain't no damn good

That's right, there's a lotta young ladies out here
That just ain't no damn good

[Female voice]
But hold up minute
There's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either

[Big Daddy Kane]
Oh yeah?

[Female voice]
Yeah, cause I had to tell one the other night
That his thing had too many 'nots' in it

[Big Daddy Kane]
What you mean by too many 'nots'?

[Female voice]
Not big enough, not hard enough, and not long enough

[Big Daddy Kane]
Yeah, aight
But check this here out

Well now, here's another story
About this kid by the name of Corey
A hustler with game tryin to make a name
That was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame

'Cause he would front like it wasn't even funny
About his girl, his car, and his money
Pullin' out a knot every place
But every single bill had Washington's face

And he went beyond exaggeration
To lie about his means of transportation
Because he said he had a Benz car
Come to find out, it was his friend's car

Talk about simple chronic halitosis
Damn, his breath was ferocious
He had an odor that just won't quit
Smelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit

Tellin girls he's daddy long-strokin
(Shit, you must be jokin)
'Cause he ain't got no bitches
And couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches

See, Corey, there's a lot you're missin
Seems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in
So let's get one thing understood
Muthafucka, you ain't no damn good

The majority of the population of males and females today
Are just no damn good",No Damn Good,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"One for the ace and two for the deuce
If you're ready mister cee cut the record real loose
And uhh, test test test test, oh yes
I wanna bless the mic, I caress with finesse
Back off the microphone, you can't wreck it none
I'm like a nine, and you're just a naked gun
Some type of new jack, steppin' in the area
Kind of reminds me of eddie murphy, coming to america
But you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious
Do the knowledge as I quote this
Freddie krueger, walkin' on kane's street
Five chapters and I still ain't been beat
Bout time I turned the microphone loose
Anyone after me is just an excuse
Even the level of the devil or exorcist
Can't get next to this
This is mayhem, so competition, say when
You're thinkin' that you're ready, so I can just play him
Or them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be
In this battle, so just flee
Cause I leave em panickin' when I start damagin'
Kickin' this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin
And frozen, this is a mind explosion
As the chosen flows in, the competition throws in
The towel, my sharp tongue is like a license
I strike like mike, tyson I be icin'
Breakin' the mic in half, just like a psychopath
But still smooth and cool, just like a draft
Leave the metro scared and petrol
Ain't no half-steppin', so I don't sweat no mc
Cause michael jackson couldn't say it clearer
My only comp is the man in the mirror
So any pretender, you never been to
The death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter
These ain't the grounds for mc's to be wanderin'
These is the grounds that the kane is conquerin'
Lyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite
Delight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night
For types who bite, to be quite like
The man with mic swingin' all tight, but can't get it right
You're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy
Sent to ride off in the sun, said kemosabi
As the kane remains everlasting
With lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin
So allow me to relieve, or breathe contact
Your brain and remain like hairweave
Cause I can reach each participant with a speech
That will teach, and have em hangin' like a leach
And yes still puttin' rappers in fear
So hold it right there, cause this is a nightmare
As I cause a killer scene, and cut like a guillotine
Any thoughts you had about winnin' is still a dream
Or more like a fantasy, tell me why can't you see
There ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me
You talk about how many rappers you slayed
But I'm like a renegade, so I never been afraid
So don't say hi to this asiatic descendant
Just say peace and everything'll be splendid
Peace!

Big Daddy Kane,"I was born

A black man from the motherland
Speakin' a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the u.s.a.
A young brother, made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that alex haley talks about
They said I'm not from asia I'm from africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in america blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?

""I was born""

A native new yorker on the streets
Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me, a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold ok
Never top 20 or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin' cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over new kids on the block and paula abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on mtv
And say, ""damn, they cold played me for young mc""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so
Conjunction junction, what's your function?
Bein' a scout, or sellin' out?
Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye
And say: who am I?

A solid change, have to rearrange this strange
Feelin' I'm feelin', so appealin'
I am having to deal with
Time to forget the myth, of bein' black and a woman
Can't get ahead, walkin' on a thread, a tightrope
Can't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope
Runnin' your scope on affairs
You have to be aware, don't flare up
Let your cup runneth over
I'm not irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish
Nor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far
Anyway I'm thinkin' about today, not tomorrow
I'm not a follower of anyone
My time has come, it's already here
My message is clear
Like the women of long ago, I am also here
Also to show, I have the courage
Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity
No matter the life, length of time
Show me a sign, should I rely on a
Subliminal message, should I question
What would seem to be, life's told me?
Yes indeed, so let me speak

And that's comin' from the daughter of malcolm x
So black women put it in your texts
So you can never let, opportunity pass you by
Or even ask yourself, who am I?",Who Am I?,1990
Big Daddy Kane,"Play it again Polo, cause I just can't stand still
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
A swift reactor rap, to impact up the track ?
I flow like a sailor

Rhymes remain hittin hard like Nighttrain
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
Rappers are gettin smoked like Camels

To weather the brainstorm, fellas better grab your umbrellas
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Takin the S off my speech to fight peach

Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
You need a fixin, for your fake rhymes lyrics and weak mixin
You robbin em blind like Nixon

Some got shook when they took a look
I'm burnin you up, like the lyrics that are pages of a cookbook
I attract more kids than Wonderama
Rhymes got more drama, than black momma white momma

You get defeated decapitated captivated
'Cause you hated the fact G. Rap made it
So if you slow you blow like a hoe, so here's a solo
Ah-yo, play it again Polo

Here's a fellow, sayin hello, Polo, mellow
P-O-L-O, shake em like Jell-o
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
So I'm a enjoy, watchin your butt burn up just like an arson

These rhymes here can kill son
You try to rips it just call me the ? Flip Wilson
And rhymes I got em down pat
Release this hit like the Superfly soundtrack

Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
The mic so hot, it can weld when it's hell
And assassinate, like Lee Harvey Os-wald

Rough on the radio, Sony or Sanyo
Rappers get slayed and played like a banjo
When I illustrate, stiller rhymers is iller
Battle me, you better swallow a bottle of painkillers

I go faster and faster, skills of a Grandmaster
Makin you fall like plaster
Amazed, grammar plays like gamma rays
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays

You pussy willow, I can see your sihlouette
You're scared, and tears of fear made your pillow wet
You want to tic-tac-toe with a big rap pro?
Yo, play it again Polo

Guys are weary, eyes be teary, survived and leary
Your rhymes are eerie, that's my theory
I'm here to jam and slam like Bam-Bam
Damn, Polo play it again like Sam

Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted

Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane

You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Rag a fag, makin him stagger like he drunken
You can't stop treatin my hip-hop
Like a Blo Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop

Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow
I'm a let, Polo wet up the whole set
Yes the final, death wish to sucker MC's
Gets granted, with rhymes makin em stand planted

I start blowin blows, and my rhymes are like a bolo

Or try to press up, it's better to fess up 

'Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man 
I start to screamin on MC's like Tarzan 
So witness the glare when I appear 
None'll compare, so take a seat in the rear

Mumble jumble kick yak, you better get back 
Clear the way when you see me comin' through 
Back up and bow, nuff respect due
Uhh, I come down and put my weight on it 
Drop somethin' straight on it, and sound great on it 

Parties erupt, and stages corrupt 
I pour like a quart in a cup, word up 
I G-E-T the J-O-b done 
Makin' the young boys say, ""Daddy I don't want none"" 
You puttin' the man to a boy, before I can even destroy 
I played him like a toy Heavens to Merkatroid! 
Check my Modus Operandi 

Those who know my name know I ain't about games 
I go beyond knockin' 'em out the box 
You want to be a comedian? Aight, where's Redd Foxx? 
So if I want you, believe I'm gonna get you 
I wouldn't give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu 
So when I come in the same place as my enemy 

They all start runnin' like their name was Sheer Energy 
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you 
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you 
Another clue, your first letters are P-you 
Act like you know boy, nuff respect due
UHH, put in rotation, better than creation, with acceleration 
My vocabulary is very 

Clever like a trick hand, sinki'n 'em like quicksand 
Makin' the competition feel like they need a kickstand 
To support what they thought would've brought them 
Some type of victory, but none of them could get with me 
You better never act new 
Huh, nuff respect due",Nuff Respect,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz
[Little Daddy Shane]
Well I'm a new jack from the new school, too cool
But some of the times I get bizarre (word?)
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel
and start to yell, BRRRRAHHHHH!
[Big Daddy Kane]
While I'm up on stage I feel that it's my duty
to do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty
Because I add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion
But I love you Shane (and I love you Kane)
That's somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love why'all (love why'all) love why'all (love why'all)

Big Daddy Kane,"[Big Daddy Kane]
When I'm in motion, it's just like the flow of the ocean 
The weight of the words swerve and curve 
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas 
Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus 
I guess that makes me the top of the line 
Oh, yes, I'm the most prime of all time 
'Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin, and the lyrics just start 
To flowing, ahem-ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going 
On with the rapture, so that I can capture 
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to 
To knowledge, the God on the groove 
Because when my tongue moves, I just love that I'm smooth 
Do it with these and in times I leave reason
To give 'em a little of the flavor that please 
As I school in the who in pursuin', and doin', and reignin' again
And the gutter, and stutter, and killin', and chillin', collectin' the rent, and 
Jammin', and slammin', and, damn, it's 
Too much for one mind to comprehend 
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend 
And the way that I be doin' rappers in 
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men 
I play somethin' verbally, capable to murder the 
Average MC; the tough ones I'll burn third degree 
And if you're thinkin' that I'm takin' a beatin'
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin'

[Q-Tip]
I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker 
When I get my ride, I be the grill squawker 
Tip's a smooth talker; I love Alice Walker 
So get off the dills and step back, you little hawker 
Better yet, you hooker; you want to show, I book ya 
The highest way I took ya; is you's a good looker?
Queens is residential; I make the presidentials 
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals 
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square 
If you went in by yourself, it was a terror 
See, I could do that 'cause my crew is kinda phat 
Outside we had the toolies; out West you call 'em gats 
It's that, 'oh, thanks' chat; well, let me drop some more shit 
Bring your bats and balls, and please don't forfeit 
'Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank 
You can ride with me, G; I'm goin' to the bank 
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane 
You get the idea 'cause page times is near 
So, rappers, see, they bug 'cause they really can't handle 
Position from the rappin' 'cause some of them be slackin'
Not in this sport of thought; we block out the devil 
The three different flavors; you know we on the level 

[Busta Rhymes]
Check it out, uh! As I come down and get dumb 
Yes, roughneck swingin' along with the drum 
Swimmin' in the track, retaliatin' thorough is how 
I react; Busta Rhymes will attack 
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain 
Gotta make a mega migraine 
What up to the Big Daddy and Tip 
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip 
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude 
Whack, do ya on the stage gettin' booed 
This structure - it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors 
On a young raider chalk; well, that's my vocal fader 
Keep my volume on extra boom! 
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room 
Word up, huh! Here I am, damn 
Dragon slayer stackin' layer after layer 
This jam will be ran while the record flim-flam 
Wiggle your front pram, to the runnin' man 
Sam, Busta, Rhymes, comin' on time 
L.O.N.S. did rip a new design 
Flavor one; taste the unborn baby 
Flip before you move or catch a bad one, baby 
Chiggy change chump, the over-sized puff 
Busta pump you and the love, and then I rump 
Emotional steer point for the wild 
Busta buck wild, musically direct from Strong Isle 
Unload, catch you like smell later 
Dig on your taste of the third flavor, rarah! 
Rarah! Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!",Come on Down,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"Hmm yeah, this sound kinda funky, this sound real funky
I'ma get busy on this, man, with em, let's see
Like 8 bars, then I want you to come in with a scratch

What? nah man, we ain't havin that!
Just trip, I'm tired of every record we do
I got to be jiggin-jiggin this, jiggin-jiggin that
You know what I'm saying? 
Yo, it's time for me to get busy on the mic by myself
On the solo tip, you know what I'm sayin?
So yo, step back and let me show you how a real DJ rocks
As I kick it like this

A DJ gets no damn credit
Don't look at me funny, Kane cause, yeah, I said it
I'm always in the background
Supplyin' the sound, but my props is yet to be found
Besides, when you're kickin' a rap
The only other people you can see is Scoob and Scrap
So y'all get the girls, okay
But I bet you wasn't gettin' skins scratchin' for Shante
And the first time a record skips
You catch an attitude and always tryin' to flip
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days I'm gonna pull the power switch
Cause I'm always breakin' my neck
10 in the mornin' you were sleepin' on my sound check
And when it's time for the show
I'm supposed to go (Big Daddy) (hell no)
Am I a man or a machine?
Or just a fat kid who don't supposed to be seen?
Don't you know you wouldn't be so amazin'
If I wasn't helpin' you out, you black raisin
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Makin' a record sayin' 'it's hard bein the Kane'
Hmm, but all you gotta do is rap
Try carryin' some console cases on your back
Well, I'm through with breakin' my neck
Until you learn to show your DJ some respect
Because without me you'd be butt-naked
So from now on, spin your own damn records
Now put your weight on that shit here
Yeah
I'm outta here",D.J. S Get No Credit,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"I break out in a cold sweat, rip up the whole set 
I'm about as bad as you can get 
Comin' from Bed-Stuy, that's where they do or die 
Forget about the lions and tigers and bears, oh my 

It's not a fairy tale, a myth, it's a musical uplift 
And I'm the wrong one to mess with 
I roll on rappers like a Cherokee, bake 'em up merrily 
Just like the cooks at Sara Lee 

Erase, replace, disgrace, and chase, unlace your face 
And place a neck brace, about-face 
And get to steppin', because my lethal weapon 
Is blowin' too fast, while you're slow as Catherine Hepburn 

What you need is a little more speed, style and flavor 
But it still wouldn't save ya 
So to the rear, step off and let the man flex 

'Cause I can hang tighter to the groove than spandex 
I snatch the mic whith grace, always with a plan 
and Cee'll cut the recored up like Edward Scissorhands 
Rock the soul shack, I can't hold back 

Four years standin' and I still got the knack 
'Cause I remember when I first did it 
The comments that were goin' around from the next critic 
Like ""Yeah, he sound alright, but still will he hold?"" 

And now my black ass is still here like Billy Joel 
One hip-hopper that don't have to sound proper 
My broken English you can still distinguish 
And I don't have no image or no gimmicks 
And I don't have no bounds or no limits 
The Kane'll keep goin', and growin', and flowin' 

And showin' any MC, I got the best finesse to manifest 
'Cause I pull cards like some type of retard 
Hittin' MCs hard, and any other Rass Claaad 
I'm the predator to any competitor 

Scorchin' and damagin' and stompin' et cetera 
And any MC that tries to test me 
I'm swellin' up his jaws mor than Dizzy Gillespie 
Crushin' all dreams you thought were possible 

I turn into nightmares you have in the hospital 
I couldn't count the rappes I be servin' 
If defeat was sex, huh, I'd be a virgin 
My match ain't been found, movin' around, breakin' 'em down 

Where the ground, never the clown, how that sound? 
Don't get gassed, 'cause boy you won't last 
so take your crippled rhymes and put 'em in a cast 
You're too pathetic, bring in a paramedic 

To heal your sick rhymes, 'cause man, you ain't poetic 
You're just a cheap little hooker and I gotta overlook a 
MC that's wack, ya little bogger 
And stand clear of the mic that I'm rippin' 

As I'm ?
And get your jury and a good defendant 
'Cause I'm servin' a death sentence",Death Sentence,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"Manslaughter, walkin on water 

I stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta 

I'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind 

True and divine the genuine, breakin a bond and gettin mine 

So freeze, I'm makin it flow with ease 

And droppin the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MC's 

Cause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow 

Huh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow 

Because I mastered the rhythms of winnin lyric 

Hit em, just the flow itself'll tell you that I did em 

So let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E 

Show you the meaning of real harmony, as I float 



Float.. float on 

Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X) 



Peep this 

I'm always on the down-low, smooth and mild 

But when it's time to get wild, huh, you know my style 

I drop lyrics wham bam by the gram on a jam 

And gooooooood DAMN! 

It's like a disaster that nobody goes after 

Rappers turn ghost like Casper 

Cause battlin me, you'd only meet your fate 

You'd probably come out better tryin to fight in Kuwait 

To be smart, would be not to start 

Not even The Wiz can give you that much heart 

Rap is like an art.. and man you know 

That kind of makes me like Michaelangelo 

Not to sound conceited, or either to boast with what I said 

Cause I'm too modest to ever lose my level head 

But if I ever got bold and said I'm higher 

I can give more reasons than Earth, Wind & Fire 

Many follow in the footsteps, tryin to get a rep 

Of a lover and a smooth black brother 

But I'm knockin imitators out the box 

Because you couldn't copy Kane if your name was Xerox 

I'm like the God in light, some of my writing might 

Be too much for your mind to explode like dynamite 

And if it sounds good to you then get on it doggone it 

Capture this like a Kodak moment as I float 



Float.. float on 

Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X) 



In this third verse, I'll make it sure mental 

See the way that you serve rap's like a death penalty 

So back up off me, ain't nobody stoppin Kane 

I'm shittin on rappers like I never been potty trained 

That means defeatin deletin and beatin 

While all the tenderonis I'll be meatin and greatin and treatin 

And welcome to a new Terrordome 

When I come to roam, you know Daddy's Home 

Rhymes come at you full powered with might 

They call in the SWAT team when I start to write 

And declared my lyrics illegal weapons in every state 

So I can get five to ten for carryin a Papermate 

Just a little bitty taste of this'll burn so bad 

You'll want to call me the Big Daddy Inferno 

So don't even think about a battle, I sail without a paddle 

In other words, I FLOAT 



Float.. float on 

Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)",Float,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"It ain't hard to tell
The flow of the Kane is movin em real well
I build and excel and plus I rap like hell
Lyrics generate, break through and penetrate
Connect like an interstate, now let me demonstrate
I grab the microphone and put the dap in quick
You start to tappin' and snappin' and clappin'
Then rappin'll happen
And then I display, poetry, the right way
And rock the Gladys knight to the next Morris day
I get sexy like Marvin Gaye
And other times, I might wanna hit em hard and say
Somethin' exquisite and clever like a wizard
Hit em like a blizzard if you missed it
Turn to your friend and say, ""what is it?""
Or what was it, because it, was too fast for you to bust it
So pay attention to how the smooth operator does it
Just acknowledge the sound
Get on the good foot uhh, and get down

Look
The thought of competition, I don't have the faintest
Cause if I'm correct, I kicked them all in the anus
So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks
The men that's all pumped up like Reeboks
Cause I bring down the swelling, just like alcohol
Maki'n em all fall like the Berlin wall
Then I apply pain just like a migraine
Pssssh, man, don't even try Kane
A lyrical catastrophe, a disaster see
Nobody gets on after me
Crushin MC's is how I get my joy
So when one tries to battle I'm like, hoo boy
Class in session as I give the lesson
To prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession
And it's nothin' new, that the Kane is your ruler
Cause back in the days I used to call you sundullah
Now it's a new time period, rappers are still fearin' it
And the crowd is still cheerin'
With the new black Caesar that came to town
With one purpose to make you get down

I start to flow, slow, and then oh no
I gotta pick up the pace and go
Go relatin' and statin' what I'm creatin' to straighten MC's
That I'm debatin' terminatin' as the Kane keeps them evadin'
So step over, cause ain't no leftover
Remains from the Kane I drained the last brain
Speak like Oprah, attack like a cobra
Turn your whole year into a red october
Lyrics are sweet like struddel, at the same time brutal
Your rhymes remind me of the noodle in umm
Chop suey, soft and chewy
My rhymes are kickin' like Bruce, you're just hong kong fooey
So +enter the dragon+ as I start to raggin'
All the competition that's on the bandwagon
I take the groove around around around around around
Around, so get down

Yo, get out your seat and jump to this
Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists
The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it
And show some unity in music
We gotta show our young ones the right way
To avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay
So I keep on teachin the children to follow the
Power equality, Allah c equality, peace

Mister cee, you gotta get down and uh
Scoob lover, you gotta get down and uh
Scrap lover, you gotta get down and uh
Big fahl, you gotta get down and my man
Jay-z, you gotta get down and
Positive k, you gotta get down and
To my man music mike, you gotta get down
And to my man larry, you gotta get down
And to my man ant live, you gotta get down
And to my man big chuck, you gotta get down
And I can't forget rog, you gotta get down
And to my man danny, you gotta get down
And to my main man sauce, you gotta get down
And to my man bobby v, you gotta get down
And to my cousin '95, you gotta get down
To my brother the lil' daddy, you gotta get down
And to my man tyrone, you gotta get down
And if I didn't say your name you can still get down",Get Down,1991

Who's that smooth fellow flowin to this tune? 

The fact is, I never left

Soon as I pick up the pen and relate it to paper 
That's the beginning 
And for you Filthy McNasty MC's, that's the ending 
'Cause when I grab the microphone just like a gun 
You know them doo-run-run-run, them doo-run-run 
Heh, I'm not your ordinary lyricist 
No one'll compare at this, as far as raps, pssh, 
I'm takin care of this 
I work the stage like a slavehand 
And keep the girls screamin just like Captain Caveman 
I did shows at the same arena that held Ike and Tina 
And the Chi-Lites, song have you seein her 
Puttin me on after Jennifer Holiday, ain't no thing 
Because I still come off, after the fat lady sings 

Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 

Here we go, Shalamar style 
That means the Second Time Around so pump the sound 
As I progress to bless the mic and strike the stage 
Enraged arouse the crowd to jump and pump their fists 
And twist their waists with grace and clap and snap 
And move and groove cause I'm still, so, smooth 
If you compare the Big Daddy to a Caddy 
I'd be an Allante, suave as Belafonte 
Interplanetary and extraordinary (hmm, what about poetic?) 
Mmm, very! 
I'm even heard it said that I was the ultimate 
Well maybe just a little bit 
And competition I'll explain to them 
That this don't even pertain to them 
To try to flow like this will crack your cranium 
So to the rear and let the Prince of Darkness spark this 
Like a vampire, bloodthirsty, uhh, have mercy 

Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy
Set it off Kane, get busy
Set it off Kane, get busy

As we enter into the third half, for this paragraph 
I want to take all of the people that's leaping along with this tune 
To another plateau they never been too -- as I continue 
With somethin funky to get into 
Give me a James Brown, Funkadelic, or Prince beat 
And watch me turn the microphone to minced meat 
I tear the roof off the mother as soon as my lips pucker 
'Cause I'm a bad mother 

Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 

Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy 
Set it off Kane, get busy

Big Daddy Kane,"Swing, you get up and dance and do your own thing
Cause I got the groove to make your eardrums ring

You want it to be live, so here it is at your service
The b the I the g the d-a-double-d-y
And when it comes to rippin' the mic, oh my oh my oh my
I guarantee you by time I'm through
You gotta give me more props than a Motown revue

Don't ya don't ya don't ya don't ya want
To feel jubilation, a musical vibration
Instead of the feel of paranoia
Thinkin' to ride or break out and someone'll floor ya
Good grief, another beef at a concert
The rappers are gettin' a rep behind the people that's gettin' hurt
The way the fights at the shows are happenin'
You might as well let Mike Tyson start rappin'
You see we have to realize the main factor
Is to have peace and let the violence cease
So don't throw your fists up, unless you're gonna pump em
In the air, and scream oh yeah, youknowhati'msayin?

Check the lyrics that's flowin' right over the tongue like a machete
My silk drawers are sweaty so you know the Kane is ready
To go to work and my job for the evening
Is to pick up the microphone and rap to relieve them
The party society, groovi'n in a high anxiety
There's dancers by the variety, so go 'head and try it g
As I do body work like midas
And I can remove the slightest, case of arthritis
Or even rhumabotosis as I heal you with the rhythm
Cause the remedy for the party people standin' around is ummm
Dancin' and havin' a ball
So live life like Michael Jackson, off the wall
And wiggle your body parts, and start to party hard
Lettin' the rhythm run through like a trolley car
Here's a sound you can get into
Uh, and now it's on you

I can't prolong my feelings for you any more
You know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to
Express myself to you
You see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things
I mean to be all honest, that is, but now hmm
well let's just say I'm not ashamed

Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
(Round and around and around)
From city to city, from state to state
And of course, from girl to girl

And I believe that I've played every game in the world
that one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)
And of all those games, you're the only chip on the table
that's made me feel this way 
Now I realize that love takes time
and trust is somethin' that you have to earn
(Ooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
but, I need the same in return (you know you got it)
These are some things that I've been meaning to say
And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize
that I'm to blame (are you sure)
So I have to take a little time out to get together
Now baby, I'm not ashamed

Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed)
what sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
Don't ever feel ashamed

You know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player
(mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ah
as ah as just a one night affair
(One night love affair)
Now all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me long
for some type of commitment (don't you want it)
Nah, since I said Ain't No Half-Steppin' (talk to me)
Aww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon)
And let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which
all feelins are the same (c'mon)
All love and respect
And never ever, feeling ashamed

Big Daddy Kane,"Take it from the man that does it real smooth
All that, ""yo baby yo baby,"" it's it's-it's-it's not the move
You gotta treat em with respect, never neglect
Try to protect, most of all, project some intellect
Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her
So be a gentlemen, and be in her corner
Make her feel like the most
For example forget goodfellas, and take her to see ghost
Wine and dine under candlelight
Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright
Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back
Tssssh, yeah they like that
Satisfaction guaranteed
We gotta give the woman what she need
These days, they don't be fallin' for no phony Casanova
Since they started watchin' oprah
So even if it's not your style
Open the door for them once in a while
Even buyin them some flowers don't hurt
Yeah it sounds old fashioned but it works!
Conversation, good communication
Only makes things better in a relation
Cause if you keep watchin' the game every week
You might find out your wife's gettin' dunked by Dominique
And that can be so upsettin'
So try a little tenderness like Otis Redding
Put the gangster approach on pause
And I dedicate this to you and yours

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you

Now, what I'm gonna do to keep the flame warm
Is sing a better love song than Jeffery Osborne
Serenade a double, what I mean is a couple
That might wanna hug and snuggle and then kiss and say I love you
Cause I think it's best to get a little affectionate
Matter of fact fellas, I would suggest you give
Your woman the treatment of a queen and supply her
With some of that baby face routine, know what I mean?
T-e-n-d-e-r l-o-v-I-n-g c-a-r-e
You figure that out, and keep it in mind
While I bring the chorus back for ya one more time

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you

I wanna do somethin' freaky to you
Take you to a level that you never been to
Cause no one knows where the nose goes
When the doors close, so take off your pantyhose
I wanna see you moan and groan as I nibble
On your bodily parts as I proceed to jump your bones
And put your feet up here my dear
So I can lick upon your toes until your Revlon disappear
The passion between will be so incredible
As I prove that a woman is edible
So if you're game for havin' a ball
Ladies, I send this out to y'all

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you

This is for the lover in you

Mic testing one two 
Right about now I want to have a little fun with this 
And just talk a little bit of junk ya know 

Be-because it's OK, ya know, it's OK to brag and boast 
From time to time, ain't nothin' wrong with that 
So I'm gonna have a little fun with it 
Check the Prince of Darkness y'all, here we go 

Four times for your mind the poetically inclined 
Genuine and divine can still climb 
When you thought that I wouldn't go to left 
But I cup a cameo and I still got strength 

So make room cause I'm sweepin' up like a broom 
'Cause I'm the straight up wholly original yeah that's right mmm hmm 
To be blunt and lay my cards on the table 
You'll be Gone With the Wind for messin' with Dark Gable 

In comes the era of the chocolate types 
Like your Bobby Brown, Aaron Hall and Wesley Snipes 
Including myself in the cipher the Big Daddy Kane is a part of it 
AKA, your prince of darkness 

When it comes to the girls they know the program 
'Cause when I get through it's pure Silence of the Lambs 
So ladies grab a hand and join the caravan 
That's bein' ran by the hoochie cooche man 

Then don't miss a breath of my kiss of death 
An A plus in lusty while your boyfriend is a F 
I come tellin' you Tales From the Darkside 
And separate the men from their women like Apartheid 

You say am I a, vam-pire 
That will react to ya just like Blackula 
But when I say Prince of Darkness I don't mean a blood sucker 
I'm talkin' about a black lover 

So mysterious and serious the women are curious 
So when I walk inside of a place it's like ""Ooh, there he is!"" 
But slow down, there's enough of me to go 'round 
Huh, I'm givin' girls more Temptations than Motown 

And tonight's the night for me to get right 
And give girls the feeling of love at first bite 
So here's a lesson of what the don art is 
Taught by the big you know, Prince of Darkness 

Stop, hold up, pause, quit 
Change the groove and funk it up a little bit 
Now back to the subject of how the 
Kane became the bigger modern day mama wild deep 

Now the question is do I really carry it 
Huh, well baby I swing low like sweet chariot 
Still a few of them thought that I was lame 
And then the big brown shah came! 

So let me send a dark shadow right through ya 
To prepare you for all of the kniky things I'm gonna do to ya 
And yes my dear if you got the goods 
Then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods 

Ahh word life y'all, a word life y'all 
That's how I, shoot off arms just like a rifle 
So just, pass the mic and let it spark this 
So that you can say it's been blessed by the Prince of Darkness",Prince of Darkness,1991
Big Daddy Kane,"Here I am, r-a-w
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phony MC's, I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making MC's run
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers, just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetratin' a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create, chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the a.m.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than dynasty, or hill street blues
I'm sure to score endure for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw!

Raw

Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hyped
Do damage on stage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift, MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and jif
Feel my blunt fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinating rhyme, as I enchant them
So let's all sing the big daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
An entertaining gain, the Kane'll never no
Problem, I could sneeze sniffle or cough
Eeee-even if I stutter I'ma still come off
Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sho' nuff ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who the baddest, or cause static
To make or break or take em, my rhymes hit the head
Put it to bed, so watch what's said
Save the bass for the piper, rearrange your tone
Take a loss and be forced from the danger zone
I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, yeah no frill
Just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up!
Raw don't even get up
Competition shut up, cause I'm raw!

Help me

The man at hand to rule and school to teach and reach
The blind to find their way from a to z
And be the most and boast the loudest rap
Again, to reign your domain (yeah Kane)
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of depth, one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of monopoly
Let em speed around the board like an astro
Then send em to jail for tryin' to pass go
Shakin' em up, breakin' em up, takin' no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So let the volume increase, never to cease
I'ma release a masterpiece a slip of the tongue like grease
Rippi'n the mic to shreds, puttin' heads to bed
Code red cause the rhymes is bein' said
By the Asiatic printer of raw poetry
No hints or clues, you all know it's me
I go pound for pound and round for round to clown the sound
Profound it's bound to go down, uh
A lyrical knockout, showin' I got clout
My comp should just drop out
Cause none of them can see me

Well, never fear, baby, the big daddy is here
I come up upon the scene to romance thee
With a little bit of T.L.C. to tickle your fancy
Give you protection, warmth and affection
Make sure you never feel any rejection
Without a doubt, I admire you, I have a desire to
Be a more better man prior to
Your past relationships; you've been datin'
With all the wrong gentlemen; I'm more sentimental
In my own little way, so (hey!)
Whaddya say about givin' a play, okay?
'Cause I'm not here to impress you; I wanna caress you
Posess you, and bless you, nevertheless
To make you feel secure, and real sure
Mon cheri amore, pretty woman I adore
Don't shed a tear, never fear, my dear; I'll be there
Anywhere with some tender lovin' care

[Chorus x 2]
Just a little bit of T.L.C.
Tender lovin' care you'll get from me
Just a little bit of T.L.C.
Tender lovin' care is what you need

In the beginning I only wanted to be your friend
But then
It may sound strange, but my feelings started to change
And now I wanna sustain
Somethin' more closer, give you the most of my love
And my time and respect as opposed to
Sayin' she's ""just a friend""
I may sound like biz, but you know what time it is
I want us to be together and benevolent
With reverence to give you the best relationship there ever been
So consider me as-as-as-as your lover
Damn, baby, you make me stutter
But I'm still able to clearly say to you
Things that I feel and kiss your navel too
Givin much T.L.C.
As I make love to you constantly

Proper amount of chivalry?

I hope to form a special thing that we can cherish
Everlasting, it won't perish
Establish a special thing that's based on love
And trust; in other words, it's all about us

'Cause for you I got it right here
You'll never find none greater
Sincerely yours

Big Daddy Kane,"It's hard enough for a black man tryin' to make it today
Strugglin' to find the right way
So I say, times is hard, word to God
Recessions, depressions, the whole nine yards
That itself makes a brother wanna break
But bein' an entertainer puts the icin' on the cake
Cause I can remember when I looked up to Kurtis Blow
And said that's where I gotta go
So here I am, paid in the rap trade
But still gettin' played, for my darker shade
That's not the only P-R-O-B-L-E-M
Man, that's just the beginnin' of them
For example, I can't walk the streets alone,
? without bein' known
Don't get me wrong, cause deep in my heart I do love it
But I can't even dig up my nose in public, huh
MC Rell couldn't have said it no plainer
Yeah, that's the life of an entertainer
And the times are so hard to understand
That it makes me a troubled man

(I got so much trouble on my mind)

I like women, but I hate womankind
Love can be just too much for the mind
Cause I've toured the world from state to state
And wouldn't lay down tonight without havin a mate
Married girls in tight miniskirts
That left they husband waitin at the concert
I don't discriminate with girls that I talk to
I take em Mello-Yello to Chocolate Yoo-hoo
But now I couldn't find the right girl to fit me
Not even if she walked into my face and bit me
You see it's hard to make a woman your wife
When you've been humpin married woman the most of your life
You better believe that's true, word up
Cause if it happened to me, then it can happen to you
I'm not tryin to say that a woman is scandalous
I'm just showin you who the troubled man is

(I got so much trouble on my mind)

Brothers from the past ?
? in the streets of Bed-Stuy or my ?Sara J? class
Some of them are cool, some of them at times can be a bother
Thinkin' I got jobs to give like Roy Rogers
I try to explain I'm not on tour yet
And they say, ""You think you're all that? Yeah, I bet!""
So when I see em on the solo tip
I gotta throw joints to prove my point
Just when I thought that I had the neighborhood support
Here comes another battle to be fought, huh
You know they even tried to start a AIDS rumor
Diggin' the kind of life, that would maybe doom a
Brother of my principle, you'd think some of these people
Would be more sensible, because a lie like that
Didn't bring my sex flow to an end
Man, I'm still gettin' skins!
And the beat goes on until the thrill is gone
And life is the same old song
And maybe one day you can understand
What it's like to be a troubled man

Big Daddy Kane,"When you work, sometimes it's wet
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
You're gonna get wet (ow!)

Work it, oh come on now, work it, ow
Now work, come on work it, ow
(You're gonna get wet)
Work it, once agin come on now, ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh now

I was the one to say I'd get the job done, I did it and got with it
I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
Instead of a crumb for a bum, uh I gotta get some
But I don't want to be a second hand, middle man
I want to take a grand stand and
Makin' the cash flow grow
Pullin' myself outta the dirt
And a job ain't nothin' but work

Work!
A job ain't nothin' but work
Work! Work!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!

[Verse 2]
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money got get me
To get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can achieve
To make ends meet like a hair weave
Survivin' in this economy people in the wold want to be
Stayin' in the upper class so you're the path
The rich gets the most and the poor gets so little
And only money love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
I gotta take, take control of my own destiny
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring my wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
Runnin' scam so damn many people will probably get hurt
And a job ain't nothing but work

Workin' everyday
All the damn week
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
A job ain't nothin' but work

No more workin' overtime
You get your's and I'll get mine
I won't stop at any cause
I won't stop till I'm the boss

Straight outta the ghetto
None of the Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
I made it this far had to gamble, scramble, ramble
Ain't no shame in my game
And I came through like a double bread
But still there's more here
I'm not the greedy I'm the needy, seekin' that financial status
That where my pockets will be the fattest
I'm not gonna be employed when times are hard
I'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge
To make myself live large
A J-O-be is not for me, I don't want no parts of it
So take this obe and shove it",A Job Ain't Nuthin' But Work,1992
Big Daddy Kane,"Hey yo Teddy
Yo
I ran into a young lady Maliya last night
Word?
Must have been her husband's payday
Heheh
Because she bought me this here brand new
Diamond link that you see me with on
Mmm
Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin? You know why?
Why Kane?
'Cause I get the job done

""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work.. baby!""

""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work.. baby!""

The question at hand, is how do I love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
But I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome
I get the job done

""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work.. baby!""

Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushed into becomin some Ku Klux wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, I let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, ""Oooh I like it,"" just like DeBarge (how large)
Smooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child
Then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like Calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..

""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work""
""I work.. baby!""

T.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!

Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm Brown-er than Bobby so won't you be my Tenderoni
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An up-to-date mack that's ready to attack
And prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl, you won't disapprove
And I promise that you'll never forget
Hmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no
Employee of the Month, cause yo, I do work
The K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B
An expert, cause I get it D-O-N-E
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done

Big Daddy Kane,"It's hell up in Harlem, my main man just caught a bad one
Wetted by a magnum when he didn't have none
That goes to show you that even when you're respected
Brothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked
So I went uptown to get the low-down
To see who made the whole thing go down
Word on the streets had it
Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
Came to start static
Some new jacks at the game
Tryin' to get a name
Had a point to prove
Wrong move
So I can't wait to get em all straight
It's a big payback when I retaliate
Steam, I gotta let it off
And I can't wait to set it off
To revenge my main man that's gone
And as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond
The beef is on

(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)

It's time to show them how to get hard
Callin' a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard
For tryin' to friddont and fiddake the middood
But when I get riddude awesome dude
So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
Bedstuy do or die is where I was lookin'
For my boys from roosevelt, albany and marcy
Plus I got a posse over in canarsie
I'm talkin' about ill brothers that don't play
They sit around watchin 'scarface' all day
So here we go, headed up to they scene
Twenty deep in a van like the a-team
We rolled up to see what this joint's about
When one of my boys in the van just pointed em out
So without delay we reacted
And started shootin' like it was target practice
When they saw that we wasn't messin' around
One tried to run, so I had to chase him down
I caught the kid by the corner store deli
Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
I did his jugular vein something violent
Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
We sent fifteen bodies to trapper john
Cos the beef was on

(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)

(I don't happen to trust people
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
To put you in your place)

(You send your boys in I send em back in a paper bag)

Many screamed about a homicide
But when I came to shut em down all the drama died
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
And we roll like the Corleone family
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
In the aftermath everything's destroyed
Like a crew of barbarians
And brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
Cos soon as I see ya, best believe I'ma call your bluff
And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff
Have fallen and they can't get up
My game is a ill one
Cos I'm a real one

To blow up the mic with rhymes you like

Shotgun, 'cause son, the Shane is not the one 
The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger 
Bring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her 
The Lil' Daddy got it down pat, yeah 
I'm like the name Heavy D, I sound fat 
Word for word, line for line, uh
I gets mine and show I'm poetically inclined 
If rap was made by (?) then redeemed because 
You ain't got no ice cream 
So take a seat in the rear 
Don't dare to compare, cause I swear, you gets nothin here 
The way you see me knock out the next brother 
You'd think my moms had a talk with LL's mother, huh 
Aiy-yi-yi-yah, momma Mia 
Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea 
Knock the boots on a girl named Althea 
Then pull her friend by the name of Maria

When I grab the microphone and shout 
You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out 
I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit em with one of the rhymes 
I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash 
Run for shelter, no one can help ya 
You pushed up on a heavyweight, 
When your rhymes are welterweight that's right, 
Wait, because you're not fitted 
You're never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Uhh, I'm what you call a rap legend 
And definitely the last MC to be present 
Don't even try to take mines 
You fuckin new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes 
Yo what's that sayin that Hammer says uhh 
U Can't Touch This, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this 
I'm like Steven Segall, ""Out for Justice""
As for competition, pssh, what's this? 
You're not prepared to, rappers are scared too 
Confront this, 'cause you know damn well you don't want this 
Some good advice is just break out 
Before I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out 
As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that 
Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that 
Cause if you go through the Wrath of Kane, uhh 
Not even Lisa Fisher can ease the pain, so

[Scoob Lover:]
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill, 
My nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville.

[Scrap Lover:]
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated. 
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail, 
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today.

Big Daddy are ya with me? 

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize. 
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa, 
But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba. 

[Chorus x3] 

Now you know you'd too like to be with it... 

[Li'l Daddy Shane:]
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain. 
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain. 
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...

Surprise!  Guess who's on the rise?
And competition, I'm takin', and breakin' 'em down to size.
I operate around the clock, like city bus.
Never take five, 'cause, yo, when you rest, you rust.
Be advised, that I pack heat for beef.
I'm knockin' brothers out the box, and knockin' out teeth.
Twenty-one years young and I got the knack.
(You got it!) To attack, and scoop girls like a set of jacks.
Rough rhymes that rag any rap herb.
Built by the best to bust swerves, like a sharp curve.
Fifty percent on wax, no matter of fact.
Every nine out of ten rap acts produce a wack track.
Twice as nice, but smooth as silk.
Somebody writin' for scrap, is like givin' a cow milk.
I release, to make it hard for the fellas to cease,
'Cause I'm the type to make noise, I don't make peace.
Here's a new jack, ready to swing,
And bring the hype type of freestyle rhyme for the crowd, to sing.
Some say there's a party, but it looks like a job to scrap.
I catch bodies with a nickel-plated rough rap.
Me and Scoob, we run together through the city,
The nitty gritty, always together like titties.
By any chance that I do get burnt,
You better believe that I'm comin' back, just like a tax return.

Here we go, y'all! [Repeat x 6]

Move over to the side, let a slim brother wreck it.
It's that Scoob Lover, kid, so pull up a chair and check it.
When I get wild like Heathcliff, or Dennis the Menace,
It's like food to a fat man, finished.
I bust your head like an apple, (an apple,)
And pour the blood in a jar, tell your moms that it's Snapple,
And wait around my way for your crew, who's next?
'Cause I be lookin' out my window with a nine, like Malcolm X.
There's no cop, they all got stomped, so
Dream on.... Dream away.... Well okay!
And play like Shante, and have a nice day.
I drop rhymes that go boom, (boom!)
And I can get funky like a high school locker room.
Don't even think that I'm country, country, bamma.
Scoob is hittin' harder than a heavy, heavy, sledgehammer.
I rock songs to make your grandmother dance.
My rhymes are more together than a girl in biker pants.
I'm never backed up, I never once had a fronter.
Boy, I get more beeps than a roadrunner. (Beep! Beep!)
I never sweat the girls when it comes to a phone call.
I got things sewn up tighter than a football.
So skip to my loo, or get stomped by my crew.
Brooklyn's in the house, and ain't a damn thing new.

[Chorus]

[Big Daddy Kane]
Here comes the prince of darkness, ready to spark this,
And show the people just who is the hardest.
Rough and rugged, kind of similar to a nugget,
But yet and still, I manage to keep the groove smooth.
Rebel for wreck, them rappers, I dissect them,
'Cause anything I say on the mic will affect them. (How?)
So bad, they gotta run for shelter.
So rappers take flight like they work for Delta.
They know I ain't havin' it, styles with no crab in it.
Fakin' and flakin' it, child, you're sadly mistakin',
'Cause who's a rapper here that Kane rip on the mic?
And start flowin', (zoom,) yo, yo, yo, where you goin'?
That's how they flee from me, the B, the I, G.
Damn man, you know my pedigree, huh.
The gangsta, murdera, killa to ya.
For sure, endure to injure him or her.
The breaker, the taker, money-maker, never a faker;
My lyrics are built like Schwarzenegger.
So all my competition gets destroyed.
You need to put your weak rhymes on steroid,
For you to ever to press up on the mightiest man.
To rip a show and flow, provin' that competition can't go.
Because I do all, it's easy for you to fall.
I move all rappers, like my name was U-Haul.

Big Daddy Kane,"Things been said, plenty rumors been spread 
Many many many new jacks got it in they head 
That they can raise up on this and put the Kane in fright 
Heheh yeah right! 
Listen, you're just as soft as baby powder 
Don't let your mouth get you in somethin 
Your rhymes can't get you out of 
Some good advice is don't even come out my way 
You better press up on Chucky if you're lookin for Child's Play 
Cause I'm a grown ass man in total command 
One of the best to ever be and 
No other can ever take a stand 
When I kick a verse the scene becomes so scary 
That niggaz get quiet like a library 
I pick up the mic like a hunter in hot pursuit 
Oh you want some of this? Then put that mic on mute 
Because you'll be in more danger than Penelope Pitstop 
Point blank, you get your shit dropped 
I got a death blow whenever I throw 
With double impact to take out the whole row 
Huh, I start swingin again and again 
You'll hear so many ""ooh ahhs"" you'll think it was Boyz II Men 
I break down, shake down, proceed down, beat down 
Back down, smack down, rip down, get down 
Showdown, throw down, rundown, come down! 
Here's a little message for your own concern 
You try to press up on this and get burned 
A battle with a non-believe is what I yearn 
Damn, niggaz never learn 

""Niggaz!"" 
""This is for your own concern"" 
""You Must Learn""

If you ever see a jam playin you can bet that damn Kane 
Will make it sparkle and bubble like champagne 
Dom Perignon I'm the Don of the set 
And I'll bet, that the girls, will agree 
That the be, the-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y Superfly feel 
Like Ron O'Neal, gets ill, I got it goin on 
Word is bond, I'm more Dangerous 
Than Michael Jackson - hah, sha-mon! 
So, I don't attract with the wick-wick-wack 
So take a step back, you new new, new jack 
'Cause young boy, all of your rhymes are pre-natal 
Mines are fatal, cause I got The Hand That Rocks the Cradle 
So stay in your crib pen, before you get did in 
Uhh, I mean done in, you gets none and 
The last rapper to press up on me wrong was 
Ummmm damn it's been that long! 
So competin is not a smart decision 
'Cause I start to dissin, then start dismissin 
You're tryin to battle with me well god damn scram 
The style that you're usin is as old as a Trans-Am 
Update yourself just like an 850 
Shift see, oh what's the use you still can't with me 
Many MC's tried their best to press up 
But I guess, their best, wasn't goooooood enough! 
I'm not Robert Townsend but every time I speak 
I'll leave a rapper's chest beatin like he had Five Heartbeats 
Knockin out comp like Rocky Balboa 
And I make more noise than a lawnmower 
For my stacks I worked hard to earn
Bein the bigger the better the badder the boss 
The brother to break em when bringin the bomb 
To blow up the Boogie Down.

Big Daddy Kane,"Enter the dragon, as I start, to braggin' and taggin'
And sayin' I'm baggin' all rappers on the bandwagon
Feel the fury of a renegade, well men I slayed
So send the aid, cause I penetrate
Bein' the best up, with lyrics I dress up, so don't even mess up
Or try to press up, it's better to fess up
Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man
I start to screamin' on MC's like Tarzan
So witness the glare when I appear
None'll compare, so take a seat in the rear
Child, you gotta understand, you just the man
Sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
Sparkin' the mic like a live wire til I retire
Whatever the comp is I burn em like fire
With all the blow, I hit em hard like PI-YAH
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
And no one grabs a hold, huh
You got somethin' to say, before it's told
If you speakin' on me, you better hablo español
Cause I ain't tryin' to have none of the penty-ante
Mumble jumble kick yak, you better get back
Clear the way when you see me comin' through
Back up and bow, nuff respect due

Uh, I come down and put my weight on it
Drop somethin' straight on it, and sound great on it
Parties erupt, and stages corrupt
I pour like a quart in a cup, word up

Makin' the young boys say, ""Daddy I don't want none""
You puttin' the man to a boy, before I can even destroy
I played him like a toy Heavens to Merkatroid!
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I ain't about games
I go beyond knockin' em out the box
You wanna be a comedian? Aight, where's Redd Foxx?
So if I want you, believe I'm gonna get you
I wouldn't give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
They all start runin' like their name was Sheer Energy
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
Another clue, your first letters are P-U
Act like you know boy, nuff respect due

Uh, put in rotation, better than creation, with acceleration
My vocabulary is very
Clever like a trick hand, sinkin' em like quicksand
Makin' the competition feel like they need a kickstand
To support what they thought would've brought them
Some type of victory, but none of them could get with me

Big Daddy Kane,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
For this somber occasion
Please join us in the mourning of this u-47
It was a great microphone in it's day
Until it met it's fate
One evening while it was in the studio
It was struck by the lyrical force of the big daddy Kane
So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
May this microphone, rest, in peace

Knock knock, guess who? yes, ooh
The bigger the b, the iggah the I
The jigga the g is comin' through
Yes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin bout
To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut
The microphone asassinator and furthermore
I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more
So if you ask to give the Kane a go
You better treat me like drugs, and just say no
Because I utilize my skills to brutalize
And in a battle, man you should see what I do to guys
Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme
And come off, like dirty panties at nighttime
Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse
With zest, and just bless, best yet to progress
King asiatic, no other rapper stands this
You couldn't be a king if you played hockey in Los Angeles
I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit ey
Point blank, the kid's stri-daight
Cause when it comes to r-a-p-p-I-n, huh
I got it locked up like a bullpen

May you rest in peace
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!

Rappers I get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em
Acquit em, when I get wit em, you can tell that I did em
I take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em
And rake em, you can't awake em from the comatose way I make em
Cause when you're messin' with me  you know what?
You can swallow a live grenade and you still won't blow up!
Pickin' up the microphone you shouldn't dare
It's like bein on a stair master, climbin' and goin' nowhere
You're perpetratin like you're ready and able
But couldn't rock a show, if the stage was a cradle
Your rhymes are old as an artifact, and you don't want no part of that
So don't even start it black
Anyone riffin' I show them how I'm livin'
And give them some of that treatment like my man Michael bivins
I smack em up, flip em and then shove em down
Huh, oh I-ah-ah-I-ah-I-ah-I don't be fuckin' around
To rip this microphone like this today
Since eighty-seven I came a long, long way
To headlinin', all the way from supportin'
And I know you've been watchin' me norton!
Through my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh
Rappers sat there, and listened, a lot of young, huh
Rappers sat there, and wishin but
You couldn't see the Kane with x-ray vision
And just because you didn't see my crew for a few
A lot of people thought the wolfpack was through
But if you think the Kane and scoob and scrap'll breakup
I tell you like Marvin Gaye, ""wake up wake up wake up""
Put it to rest, it's best to 'fess
Because the Kane is breakin' rappers like the IRS
And consider this microphone the deceased
Now may it rest in peace

May you rest in peace
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!",Rest in Peace,1993
Big Daddy Kane,"One-fifty-eight Lewis Avenue 
Between Lafayette and Van Buren, that was back during 
The days of hangin on my Bed-Stuy block 
With Spence and Mitch, followin my cousin Murdoch 

All the brothers were real, goin for what they feel 
By the way, peace to my man Sha and Big Neal 
Now in ninety-three I'm still bein me 
You think my 'fridgerator ain't full of Olde E? Huh 

A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie 
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches 
And I don't try to act brand new 
Eatin escargots and usin words like ""rendezvous"" 

The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome 
Make a little money and then forget where they came from 
Livin a plastic lifestyle, you're more false than dentures 
Don't make me pull your file -- stop shammin! 

[Chorus: x3]
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" 
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" 
Stop shammin! 

Stop, hold-up, pause, wait""  
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" 

So why you want to be what you're not? 
And claim to have things that you know you ain't got 
You're just a fantasizer -- spendin all your money 
On lustrous pink oil moisturizer 

Just to make your hair curly and thin 
You say, ""Black is beautiful,"" but then you go and bleach your skin 
Money you're worse than Yacub 
'Cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two 

Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever 
And nmmana-nah-nah I just can't believe ya 
It's quite obvious you don't want to be a black man 
So what's next - you're gonna join the Klu Klux Klan? 

You sold out to your race and it's a big disgrace 
You can't look your own people in the face 
You wonder why it ain't no black schools or hospitals 
You're makin millions of dollars and it's pitiful 

That you can donate to leukemia all the time 
But you can't give the Nation of Islam a dime 
They mention Muslims, you change the subject 
You can't even shake Farrakhan hand in public 

That whole busy attitude is a sham 
Umm bro, umm brother, umm.. Brougham, stop shammin! 


[Chorus: x3]

""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait""  
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" 

""Change the groove and funk it up a little bit"" 

I look in the mirror, at times I say, ""Damn Black Caesar; 
How'd you get to be the woman pleaser?"" 
'Cause I remember when girls didn't notice me 
And now they want to Come and Talk To Me like Jodeci 

It's strange, how back in the days I couldn't get with em 
Now all of a sudden the honies they want to give me rhythm 
Well I'm a hit it, but still I show no pity 
So I hope you don't think you gonna be in my next video 

And many brothers I never even ran with 
Be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid 
I mean just to get a piece of the action 
Man they start rememberin more times than Michael Jackson 

But I can't fade to the tag-alongs 
That want me to drag em on 
Frontin like a friend just so I can put em in 
But you cuttin yourself paper thin - stop shammin!

Get on down and make your move 
Welcome to the funkiest 
Brooklyn style, laid out like this 

I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood 
where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn 
where the grimies are born and bred 
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head 

Well is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map 
where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps 
The party addict about to explode 
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code 

Parlayin' on the corner, drinkin' 40's shootin' cee-lo 
It's a Brooklyn thing, alright? You know our steelo 
And for those who just don't know how it go 
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know 

So yo, who want to set it? You better kick your best G 
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me 
I represent for the fo' main 
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggaz can't hang

Now, let's get straight down to the point 
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin' it to 
Makin' a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget 
where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not 

and front with what you got 
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real 
What type of mission can I say you on? 
Because you must of done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh 

I'm really happy to see you blew up 
But always remember my man you grew up 
in the PJ's all your life, in a broken home 
(Well alright now) 

Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT! 
I be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover 
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother 
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made 

the man with support and always stayed a fan 
My dialectic style is perfected 
in ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted 

Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops 
I'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam 
So check out the asiatic type of flow 
like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style 

[Chorus] 

Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice 
I'm flippin on niggaz like little kids on that mattress 
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's 
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's 

So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin' 
My boys in the back, clockin' your jewels, and they scheamin' 
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow 
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile 

No need for beef chief I'm rollin' mad deep

Now I can remember one time I said,

I get down for my crown with new found wreck 
And bring the noise like I'm comin to soundcheck 
The stage is clear for me to rock it 
So I snatch the mic like a Brooklyn nigga does a pocket 
Clear the throat, to perform the art 
To treat the stage like a movie ticket and rip it apart 
Watch the crowd burst from lyrics that I say 
To make the brothers get ill, and by the way Dukes 
If that's your girl in the corner stay up on her 
'Cause I've been watchin the morgue, then the Korean store owner 
(Whoo!) Mack man number one, you know how I move 
You'd think that I'd be shavin my rhmes, cause they'd be so smooth

When I come to roam you know daddy's home."" 
Watch out now! 

Just like Sylvester it's still on, get it? 

Still, on, fukkit, let's move along 
I rip shop, in hip-hop, to sew it like a ziplock 
To get props, in this spot, look at me at the tip-top 
The kid got, to get hot, you thought that I would flip-flop 
Or drop-drop, but ummmmmmmmmmmm.. I did not! 
They say, ""Kane you're old school out here!"" 
I said, ""I guess I got left back, cause I ain't goin nowhere"" 
The Kane will remain in this domain 
To reign again when I entertain 
'Cause when it comes to lyrics, I got plenty black 
I'm so god damn dope, I sell rhymes in a twenty sack

Hip-Hop orientated, keepin you captivated

Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot

Oh my god, tell me, is it really him?
The legendary lyricist makin' matters grim?)
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
Rappers start shakin' like the legs on Elvis Presley
Sayin' (it's him, the great) that's how I intimidate
But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break
And pickin' up the microphone after I left
Is like givin' mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath
In other words, I don't leave no remains for you
(Forget the men, that's the evil that kane'll do)
I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
The magnificent, none can come swifter than
Cool as, but my skin color is different
We got the milk and honey
My rhymes are just like Abraham Lincoln's face (on the money)
Makin me freshest on the land, but let's not forget
That if I rapped under water they'd be aquafresh
The best, oh yes, I guess (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
You said that shit in '88)
Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
The source to the force, so put it on pause
The one that assures applause, never took a loss
Stronger than some olde e quarts to a can of coors
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease
Don't make me put my timberland boot to your grill piece
Big scoob from brooklyn comin through, don't start me
Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)

Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
Or even think that you could flow this lovely?
Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
I rip it apart, and flip up the art cause I'm the best, damn it
I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin' on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The chocolate city for black Cesar incorporated
(and all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than special ed
Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin' against anyone else
I'm tellin' you, don't do it to yourself

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it

And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms 
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare 
'Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin' for the stairs 
And do me a solid, run to the store shorty 
And pick me up some Olde E, but not a 40 
Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast 
To make the coldness last 

And while you at man see where'd your friend go (word) 
He shoulda been back a hour ago with the indo (yeah) 

And meet us in the back park to get sparked 
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark 
Ayo Jay, I see that bulge in the back of your jeans 
Hope that's the God you Now, know what I mean? 
'Cause if somebody brings the noise, I'ma make it a silent movie 
So take the safety off the toolie 
'Cause I don't want no beef, nah baby
The only thing I want to do is parlay
Peace and harmony is what I relate to 
But damn man, drama's just in the nature 

So to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
To my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
And to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 
Ah to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 

I send this out to the homies in the hood 
That stood by my side, to help a brother do good 
Just like SWV you was Right Here 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there 
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle 
Down to the brothers, that got a swift hustle 
Like good golly Miss Three Card Molly, a neat trick 
Where people get beat quick 
Want to see a sweet vic? 

Jackety Jack, blackety black 
You get nuttin' back, and that's a fact 
The sweetest game I ever seen 
All you gotta do is find the red queen 
Just point to it, can anybody point to it? 
I play by the point of the finger, the tone of the voice
""The one in the middle. The one in the middle"" 
That's black, you get no money back",In the PJ's,1994
Big Daddy Kane,"[Verse 1]
Somebody tell me who's that, what's that 
It's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack 
Don't even front and try to ask who is this 
Cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah witness 
Stronger than listerine, moppin' up rappers like Mr. Clean 
Oh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene 
Booyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck 
Cause when I come through, I'm catchin' wreck, like a tow truck 
Cause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade 
I'm stayin' on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid 
And anyone comin' to me for a battle is gettin', slayed 
Whenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin' I got it, made 
So back up off me, cause yo' rap 
Have no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat 
Cause you can dream about bein' this up to par 
But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are 
Competition I'll drill em, and definitely out-skill em 
To make the long story short, I kill em 
Cause I face em like Jason, bizarre 
And when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ahh 

[Chorus]
Come on, heidi heidi heidi hoe 
And yo I got the funky flow 
So let yourself go! 
Heidi heidi heidi hoe 
And yo I got the funky flow 
So let yourself go! 
Come on, heidi heidi heidi hoe 
And yo I got the funky flow 
So let yourself go! 
Come on, heidi heidi heidi hoe 
And yo I got the funky flow 
So let yourself go! 

[Verse 2]
Givin' you mo', ready to go, kickin' the flow, rippin' the show 
Comin' to blow, check out a pro, look at the glow, act like you know 
Left the lonely lonely through lyrics loose in me 
Leave the lowlife left lingerin' lost like
Anything you can imagine done to a microphone I did it 
Ripped it, flipped it, hit it, split it, let it so dig it 
But don't make me get ill, or chill, cause if I exercise my skill 
Rappers'll hit the floor like Johnny Gill 
The smoothest soloist, with this to exist to bliss 
And diss who risk to test this 
Cause this ain't no game, I treat you like 
A picture of my ex-girl, and rip that ass out the frame 
I come pursuant, pursuant, pursuant, pursuant 
And step it to him, to him, to him, to him, to him 
I leave a rapper's career ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined 
And watch him fade like my voice is doin', doin', doin' 
Ease back when I attack 
Your poetry is wack so don't ask for no slack 
Cause I'm tell you straight up, I'ma bring it son 
You want poetic justice go see John Singleton 
Because a battle ain't no thing to me 
And I don't look nothin' like Tarzan 
So don't think you can swing with me 
Just let the Kane take control, I'd like to know 
If you really ready for some super dynamite soul! 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3]
So what's this? A new attitude, you're tryin' to act rude 
You saw  menace and now you in a gangsta mood 
What are you kiddin' me? That's the heart of stupidity 
If you want to be a gangsta, join the mafia in Italy 
Fakin' and frontin' on stage like you're hard 
I hope when you get to Detroit, the real thugs gon' pull your card 
Flashin' guns like you got somethin' to prove G 
What, you want to be in the next John Singleton movie? 
You're sayin' that you're buckwhylin' 
But don't convince me, convince the brothers on the island 
Otherwise just forget it, unless niggaz that did ten years 
Say you a gangsta, I ain't wit it 
Yo, I raped his mother, yo, I shot and killed him 
Is that what you want to get across to the children? 
I guess you're not gonna be happy til it's for real 
Four year old kids, doin' drive-bys on Big Wheels 
Or maybe you want to see it be more fatal 
Like Kindergarten kids, tryin' to cook crack with Play-Doh 
Now I don't mean to take the fun out the jam 
I just want some to understand about the gun in the hand 
We gotta show our people how to live equal 
Peace out, I'm catchin' folks on the sequel 

[Chorus]",Let Yourself Go,1994
Big Daddy Kane,"Do you know, what you're goin through? 
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you? 
The way I flow for you, do you know? 

Yeah baby c'mon 
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song 
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon 
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song 
One double nine to the four, gotta keep em on the floor 
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore 
What I'm used to hearin, I can't believe it's gone 
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on 
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees 
I even make Sisters With Voices Weak in the Knees
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen 
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives 
Who want to test these skills, come see how it feels 
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills 
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin 
If my rhymes was in braille, you still couldn't touch em 
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat 
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that 
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type 
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right 
Here's the news, you lettin the word hardcore be misused 
You ain't never paid dues 
Be for real, you ain't tough yet 
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck 
Your whole image is a damn sham 
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am 
I always remain the Kane inside a battle 
Never to walk in anyone's shadow 
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own 
And with my competition I let it be known 
That battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son 
Six million ways to die, choose one! 
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon 
We might as well be havin sex, the way that I put it in em 
And do I crush MC's, are you kiddin me? 
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery 
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I blow 
A rapper off the map, with the rap, when I flow 
Then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I know 
That all of this is good to go, cause yo 
That's the way the flavor always come 
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum 
The Brooklyn style cause that is where I'm from 
You want the funk so let me give you some 
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that 
Amazin the people the style of the rapppin, is quite fat 
I'm lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat, on the mic black 
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that 
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone 
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan 
'Cause all the ladies I'm givin em lots of love 
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove, good God 
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some 
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmie ones 
Watch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E 
And none of you players can control me 
You get the chance to see a true mack man 
With skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than 
Taller than anybody else's stacks it seem 
'Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine 
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical 
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical 
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors 
'Cause Kane is makin a comeback, like Puma's! 
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company 
And Bogart, like my name was Humphrey 
When I get through, there'll be no more of them 
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium 
I make mad MC's give me my P's 
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these 
N-you-T's, like the you-N-V's 
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-heeees! 
Razor sharp, many ways of art 
Source rings the chart, people praise the God 
For kickin the flows so fantastic and this one here 
We're callin it Lyrical Gymnastics 

Uh, so baby baby c'mon 
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song 
Uh, ah baby baby c'mon 
Suki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!",Lyrical Gymnastics,1994
Big Daddy Kane,"The definition of sex varies with many people 
In search of a few ways to define it 
We asked actor/comedian Mr. Dolemite his definition of sex 
And his response was.. 

Baby, sex is just like puttin money in the bank 
Once you take it out, the interest is all gone 

Then we asked rap star Big Daddy Kane his definition of sex 
And well according to the Prince of Darkness.. 

Here comes Kane the mack, the sex maniac 
Bring on the honies and you can't restrain me back from ff.. 
Nah I better not say the whole word 
So uhh, let's just say what make Whoopi like Goldberg 
Cause I want to make you sweat, get you wet 
Perform a miracle in this love duet, see baby 
I play the game like Keno, plus I know the 
Scent of a Woman better than Al Pacino 
And when it comes to girls, I show no mercy 
They lick me on the chest and say, 'To hell with Hershey' 
Now it's time for me to lick that body 
And this is no Ordinary Love, ask Sade 
Baby you're bound to perspire, when I use 
The nipples on your breasts just like a pacifier 
Honey please, keep your body at ease 
And let me see what I can do with those 34 see's 
I plan to lick your bellybutton my dear 
And let my tongue walk five steps downstairs 
The way that I plan to put this chocolate syrup to use 
I'm gonna wake up in the mornin with a hairy sweettooth 
And now you're under my spell like a magician 
Abra-cadabra, good sex and I have ya 
Laid out, waitin for a big treat 
I'm not the Ku Klux Klan but I stay under sheets 
And when it comes to sex, yo I'm the illest 
Plus I know more +Diff'rent Strokes+ than Arnold and Willis 
I make you feel the reel to reel you feel 
When I break the headboard down like Shaquille 
Then bend over doggy style and just watch me 
Ride yo' black ass like I was still filmin Posse
Then I'm the one that gets the job done 
My mattress have more bodies than Al Capone's, gun 
When I get through givin you mine, uhh 
Girls be callin me back like star-69 
So come on over here hottie, let me just 
'Work that body, work that body' 

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Straight like that

Aiyyo 
How many real niggaz out there like to have sex 
C'mon, just ? 
I said how many real niggaz out there like to have sex 
C'mon, just ? 
And say sex (sex!) 
Say and more sex (and more sex!) 
Say I like it (I like it) 
And say I love it (I love it) 
Say I need it (I need it) 
Say I eat it (I eat it, whoa shit) 

Yeah 
Well keep it on baby baby, keep it on and ah 
Ah keep it on baby baby, keep it on and ah uh 
Keep it on baby baby, keep it on and ah

'Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hand, you still can't get no cards
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playin cards
But if I got beef and it's time for code red
My drill is like a hoe, and be takin mad niggaz to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join a army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burnin Scoob, ""I don't think so mate""

Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groo-hoove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Sauce:]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
how you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N. B. A. style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
'Cause I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win, lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
if I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if your down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Shyheim:]
Yo, yo
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killin'
when I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
'Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'ma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child locks you down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a Trailerload with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Now tell me whoooo is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And steppin to me, thinkin I can be touched? Huh
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
and see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leavin rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none! Huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me, 
but with with speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistible, non-competible
No, No I'm not sayin' I'm the best, I'm just sayin' I'm fuckin' incredible!
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a FLICK, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
she says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is G

Big Daddy Kane,"Now I'm a family man that works hard for the money 
With the sweetest wife ever I love you honey 
I buy her everything, if it takes my last dollar 
Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor 
We spend ample time together, doin' dinner and a movie 
And whatever else sounds groovy 
And when we want real excitement and drama, word to momma 
We walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas 
I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her 
I'm far too carin' to be considered a woman beater 
My style is gentle, romantic and friendly 
Nothin' like the husband from 'Sleeping With the Enemy' 
I thought that she was in love with me 
I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me 
But lately things been seemin' strange and... 
Baby you changed 

[Chorus: ]
Somebody's... been sleeping in my bed!
Somebody's... been sleeping in my bed! 

Now I've heard of traffic but I've never heard of when 
You get off at five and don't make it home 'til ten 
Another thing that I can't comprehend: 
Matchbox and pens from the Holiday Inn 
And every night that I had to work late 
I come home to see that the bathroom ain't straight 
I look at the toilet bowl and wonder whassup 
Because I know damn well that she don't piss with the seat up 
And lookin' at the underwear in the room 
Now I wear silk drawers; whose Fruit of the Looms? 
Another thing that's quite bizarre - 
My bathrobe smelled like Brut, but I use Dakar 
Now I'm seein' that she's treatin' me crummy 
Also, she must take me for some dummy 
Because she'll lay in bed and say, ""Come on in"" 
But them ain't the same bedsheets from this morning 
Now yeah my dear have you been busted 
But I still feel like P.E., 'Can't Truss It' 
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head 
And you might get that, you cheesy rat 
'Cause thinkin' about the cost of a divorce 
I feel like Johnny Taylor, it's cheaper to keep her 
Cheatin' on me, what's the reason why? 
I hope you die 

[Chorus: ]

You done hurt me, broke my heart 
and played me for your fool 
Now here's my chance to get back at you 
and I'm gonna blow my cool 

All day long, I'm just singin' a 
Somebody done somebody wrong song 
I'm tryin' to see how far can this kid go 
Before our relationship ends up on skid row 
Why should I try to stay attached to her 
When I'm probably better anywhere as a bachelor 
So go 'head girl with that game you're talkin' 
And since you look like CeCe Peniston, 'Keep On Walkin'
Your your your cheatin' heart, you're tryin' to rip mine apart 
Uhh, I wish I'd seen it from the start 
Cause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort 
Took a short, so I'll see you in court 

[Chorus: ]

Big Daddy Kane,"Daddy daddy tell me a story of how you took out that wack mc
No daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger
Daddy daddy tell us a story!

Heh heh, alright, alright, alright y'all OK
Come on y'all, crowd around daddy now OK? c'mon
Y'all just sit there and listen
I'ma tell you about the mc
And I'ma tell you about the bootlegger, OK?
Here we go children

It happened at a jam, some kid tried to sham on the program
So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am
So I just set it off on my competitor
Freakin' the funk as I hit em with crazy metaphors
Like back up off me dukes, because you're trippin'
You better dry your cranium off, cause your brain is slippin'
You beatin' me is somethin' that I doubt
The only way you could bake kane is workin' in a crackhouse
No man alive can withstand the kane flow
I kick so much flavor that my shoes loOK like a rainbow
You need a whole lot of practice, you thought that you was
On the money so I took you out like taxes!
Now you can flea off, releasin' me g, easy be
To keep the great mc
Then I throw em I lean and mean record to spark
So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark
Next I translated, my rap is more educated
And made it complicated for him to illustrate it
My dexterity, put him in fear of me
And had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin' see
That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
So I just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around
I triple the words, when makin' the rhymes, whatever the rhythm
Puttin' his mind in a prison
And oh yeah, that's how I did em

That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (hey)

I was out flex, lookin' cold sex in a lex'
Sippin' on a beck's, pumpin' the remix of Das Efx
Drive down 125th with my man
And what did I see, bein' sold at the stand?
A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
So I snatched everything with my name on it
And give me that kool g. rap tape, and give me that ice cube
And all the wu-tang joints, cause they're my boys too
A man tryin' to make a livin', I can't knock it
But now you tried to take money out of my pocket
Word to miz, what the problem is, is that the kids
Didn't buy it from the wiz, they bought your shaky fibs so
Now it's time to move him off the block
Pass me the glock cause I might make a body rock
And I'll break down sixteen shots
That's one + eight + seven on a undercover
Bootlegger, you're worse than a beggar
Makin' a fake profit, stop it
Cause I work hard for the money, to make cash flow
To have another come along and take my dough
No
So I just told my man, aiyyo
Throw the tapes in the Lexus
Then we burned his whole stand down just like Waco, Texas
And then I jumped on the brother, with rage
Crushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed
Cause I don't think he even know whatever hit him
Bootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em

That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (hey)

Give it your best shot, bring it with all you got
And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot
Cause it ain't wise to address me
I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me
Cause I don't just do em, I run through em
And I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em
Lyrical torture, never could support ya
For steppin' to me, agony is what it brought ya
Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
That could never be touched, and I mean this
So one love, I'ma leave you with the rhythm
Ain't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em

That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)
That's how I did em (huh) that's how I did em (hah)

Big Daddy Kane,"People people, we gotta get over
Before we go under, and I wonder
Why we can't find a little piece of mankind
Instead of always step back, gimme my damn nine
Livin' the thug, like the shoot up the drug type
They love to hear the people sayin', ""yo that kid is bugged right?""
Just a game, so please, out here men die
The average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five
Cause someone else got the clock rocked
Tryin' to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block
But if you asked me who's the man I'm like, ""you tell me?
I don't know, ed lover, Dr. Dre and heavy d?""
I got my mind on comin up, if not in first place
Then damnit I plan to be the first runner up
But it seems, I got a lot of problems under my belt
And everyday I gotta ask myself

Ah what's goin on, in our society
What's goin' on, in a de country
What's goin' on, in your community
What's goin' on, tell me

I seen a kid freshly dipped with mad gold
Fifteen years old, with plenty drugs bein' sold
But then somebody caught him for his air jordans
His drugs the cash and the jewels he was sportin'
You wanna call your girl a b-I-t-c-h
You can't appreciate so now she's humpin your man, then she ain't
Cause when you teach her that hoe mentality
They accept that as reality and give all your friends the skin
You need to show some love for your people
All men are created equal, that's why with everybody I always
Spread love, and keep my pockets full of dol-dollars
But check it out now
We're not the uncivilized, the Kane
So let's get it together, man we did it when we were slaves
Instead of always tryin' to blame someone else
Take a look around, and ask yourself

Ah what's goin' on, in your community
What's goin' on, in a dis country
What's goin' on, in our society
What's goin' on, whoa

Nowadays it's all about provin' you ain't nuttin' soft
And everybody's always talkin' about bustin' off
But that ain't where we gotta go, kid we can throw
And handle this thing like holy field and blow
Then when we get it off our chest, let's put it to rest
And try to make some money progress
Because if I got a dollar, and you got ten
And you can get a hundred from a friend if five others kick in
Shoot, we can take that stack and put it back
In a community that's black, to make our people attract
Like somethin' magnetic, cause word is bond it's pathetic
We always talkin' about this piece of the pie
But it seems we can't get it
Unless we field the life of a drug dealer
And start stellin' llello but you know where they go
Up to the penile, because they chose to be wild
And now you're upstate kid, uh, waitin' patiently to see trial
Now let that whole gangsta route slide
There's too much money and skins here on the outside
For me to ever let my freedom go
Cause I got mine, now get yous, and let me know

Ah what's goin' on, in our society
What's goin' on, when you nah haf no money
What's goin' on, people on the street
Whoa, why is it so",W.G.O.N.R.S.,1994

When I get with em, girls I'm in em, smokin like bags of ism 
The one that keep amazin y'all, don't even know who you're facin, pa 
The Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car 
The one who created it and many others imitated it 
I heard your rap style, kid - hated it 
Let me show you how, look here, now check my style 
What I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say wow 
Ba-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down 
And sway, sway when you hear the music play 
Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say 
Hey 

I'm in love with Big Daddy Kane 
He makes the party swing 
He turns the mother out 
And rips apart things 

Then I go...

And I love the way it's goin down 
Da-da-da-da-da 
You know I like the way it sound 
And I just love the way it's goin down 

Now, what's this b.s. you're sayin? 
And don't try to act like Martin now with all that 'i was just playin' 
No need to grief or mourn cause now the beef is on 
Boom-bow-boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone 
Just cause you rap that don't mean that you catchin wreck with me 
You step to this, I give you mic-o-vasectomy 
I only know one person that can come next to me 
No, that's a tattle 
'Cause I can't count my own shadow 
A battle? I gots to have it 
Unless you're gonna rob me like they give Riddick a win for Chavez 
'Cause tryin to go against the Kane rappin 
Is like a pimp tryina pull a nun - ain't nothin happenin 
Clear the way for the one, champion, true black don 
Gun gettin the job done take a look, hon 
Back up, son, you know you can't get none 
Come on, I'm on a whole other level of rap 
And it's like that, now show me where the party at

Come back to the K to the A to the N to the E 
Live from New York, the one and only 
I give it to you raw for my homies 
And to the ladies: I take em lookin' somethin' fine 
It don't mind if we bump 'n grind 
If you're with me, jump in line 
Because if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic 
Then you better believe, girl, that you're gonna get your ass dicked 
Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur 
The kind you saw rhyme before 
But now you never find no more 
Steppin' to the Kane with some drama to be startin 
Because I put em all on ice like Tonya Harding 
Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy 
Rollin with me on a mission that's to seek and destroy 
So, to all the people that's been tryin' to talk about me 
You better change your name to 5000 cause you're Audi 
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin' to them too 
Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through 
The groove, with more style than a backstroke 
Drivin' past my competition like cab drivers do black folks 
That's the way I move, I always stayed a Smooth 
Operator with data watin' for you to play a groove 
To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about

Yo G, yo Kool G, yo
I'm doin this right here
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
[Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you

I'm tryin' hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin' me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin', for peace in the people I'm meetin'
Black white and Puerto-Rican men are greetin' each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin' pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this
A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake
Havin' fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I believe, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst
Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse

People, make peace, and learn to live equal

Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build
A united nation, eliminate segregation
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly

Big Daddy Kane,"Here I am, R-A-W
Terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phoney emcees, I move on and seize
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making emcees run
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the A.M.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme
With authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw
'Cause I get raw!

I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin'
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten
Or eaten, or just tookin' out
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out
And real nervous, when I'm at your service
So give me that title boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb
So full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float, on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get em in a battle and make them all history
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin'
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin'
On a throne, with a bronze microphone
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own
'Cause I get raw!

Chillin', killin' like a villain
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin' a sniff
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world
Could ever come with more, I get raw!",Raw,1997
Big Daddy Kane,"Rappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none 
I'm the Kane so you know the outcome 
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner 
Hip hop to me Re boxing to Roy Jones Jr. 

The genuine, search and you'll find 
That on the microphone I can handle mine 
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill 
When it's time to rock the mic like Al Scratch I get ill 

I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight 
Effects on MC's are similar to kryptonite 
Water flows that be hard to distinguish 
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this 

I'm marvelous at the art of this, even if you got assist stepping to me is a lot of risk. 
I release skills that's abundant to explode and drop on you like flight 800 

[Chorus] 
Keep it moving world renown 
Showing and proving 
That we can hold it down 

Here's a percentage of that old vintage 
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image 
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya , Let me school ya 
On what it is, straight up square biz 

Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring 
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing who the king 
Asiatic non equivalent to any 
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny 

The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise 
That it comes from what I vocalize 
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with 
The stroke of death And I ain't even broke a sweat 

But this is where I draw the. line you're sure to find 
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind 
What's being caused is many MC's I'm seeing lost 
The hip hop laws should be reinforced 

You made a record this year, Oh you're hot 
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got 
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not 
Now back up off me, here I come to blow the spot 

[Chorus]

Alright, here I come to get some 
But instead you don't want the love to spread 
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dumb one's tool 
So daddy says nothing he keeps his cool 

I been through your tribulations and conflicts 
Anything possible to keep me out the mix 
But ease back, boy you better freeze that 
Where my rivalries lack I'm still nice with these Black 

I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted 
And be another statistic 
How many more to try, is sure to die 
Slaughter I, all that player hating only makes me fortify 

To get the papers to me is a necessity 
And I don't want a piece of the pie I want the recipe 
I can't lose with what I use 
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues 
Don't get it confused

Any way you choose it, baby, yes I doos it
Laying it out with swift vocabulary
I hope you hear me, here comes the Brooklyn theory
At your service, got you shook and nervous
Now, what you gonna do when Black Caesar comes to surface
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
So I can climb aboard that money train with Wesley Snipes
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
And every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik
What you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's
Easy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp
It's that old tramp, the one who keep your pum pum's damp
I see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear
Yes, there's a lot of game run here.

Verse 2
On stage at arenas or a show in the park
I shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark
If you're ready or not, if you're petty or hot
Here comes the reign of Kane about to get in your spot
Your tough talk's monotonous, beware as I be droppin' this
Lyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis
Sexual Chocolate the velvet smooth voice
That be the people's choice and get the girls moist
No time for timid fear, cause there ain't no limits here
Got the world in my hands you ain't even found the hemisphere
It's real scary how rap skills vary bringin' dollar bills near me
Making dough rise like Pillsbury
Now get this it's time we start stepping to our business
I come as living proof so bear witness
Not to contradict myself but see really
I'm untouchable but making sure you people feel me

Verse 3
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
Some cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy
So I move swiftly, play the field like Ken Griffey
Because, I be the all mighty, relax like Tai Chi
Making it irie
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
More chips than Doritos I know we all trying to see those
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
See what the fact is, is you need practice
With girls I just mack this, stick em in just like cactus
Watch me now, baby it's all right
I got bunions on my game from it being too tight",La-La-Land,1998

Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was rosa parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the kane story

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky

Verse 2
Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't erykah badu
Black caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest pai mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch em what em do you know the style ain't nothing new

Chorus
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live
Repeat

Verse 3
A good game it lets the plot thicken,
But the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than lauryn hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line

Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky

Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like Rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how Jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch em what em do you know the style ain't nothing new

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live

A good game it lets the plot thicken,
But the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' em black
Closest thing to me would be nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high

A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat""

To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction

State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

Big Daddy Kane,"Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food'
Competition I just devour
Like a pitbull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The be	-I-G D-A-double D-why K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginzu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause...

Ain't no half-steppin'
 I'm the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)

My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of MCing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have MC's coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over MC's
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that...

Ain't no half-steppin'
 I'm the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)

I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing'
Psst, picture that...

Ain't no half-steppin'
(3 times)
Mister Cee, step to me...

The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MC's evaporate
The party people say, damn...that rapper's great
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like letter, man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's, who are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him 
And take him and mold him and make him

Play your plee's, just a crook over here

Look over there, cat's is sittin' pretty with the chilly-willy
Cover me son, yo I'm gettin' busy
Yo, we prepare for anything that transpire
Keep ya mouth closed when I pass fire

Slap fire out ya ass 'cause you gettin' too gas
I know my math and I mix it with the razzel-taz
Hide your bling, bling, you ain't down with God
And all the wolves know you left without your body guards

How could it not be hard, we swell dee-sel
Pee-pel feel hell, neck and back like e-zell
Niggas wanna re-bail, follow the dust to the mist
Come and get it, now who's fuckin' with this?

('Cause it's a stick up)
Honey's wanna back it up, thugs wanna bag it up, no need to act up
('Cause it's a stick up)
Got it rapped up, got it cracked up
Get your hands high, up in the air before you get slapped up

Big Daddy Kane,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it

I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow, talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this
Pardon my Spanish and French

Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
Till your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringin' bells, my name's so demandin'
Shit, I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota Fanning

I hope you niggaz over standin', I stay sucker-free
The next king of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody

I'm the same thug that be surrounded with women
Gave the game true religion before you found it in denim
Feel the Wrath of Kane and you could not escape
The hip hop version of ?The Ring? and you just watched the tape

And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We trill, workin' the wheel, understand nigga?

I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin'
I'm way past endin' in my series of warnin'
You flex with me tonight, playa, you dead by the mornin'

Bun Beater, the best ever breathin' or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Go to any city nigga and bring my name up
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up

Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin' ass and then burp him
Don't fuck around, I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the King of the Underground, so act like you know me

Homie, we big steppin', big reppin'
We givin' kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin'
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, pop you to death

I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons
Till you strip vexin? to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection

He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan

Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin' cheese till the rubber bands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin' when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em ?Hot Pants?

I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame, they call me Sweet James
Or call me Sir Jones, two hundred dollar cologne

Board Nine or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin'
Fuck around, I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket

Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin' watchin' my top fall in
On my Lamborghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguine, shrimp and a bowl of lean

What you know about gettin' cross country?
Nigga, your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back
That ain't no Emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that

But You exchange them for the good things that You have

Chorus:
Lord I want to sing..
I wanna sing you a song, I wanna lift up my voice
As I lift my hands, Lord I make my choice
That from this moment on until the end of my days
I want to offer up my life as a sacrifice of praise,
As a sacrifice of praise

God of Glory, God of Might
King of Heaven, Lord of Light
Though my ways are less than wise,
I come to praise You

Jesus, Master, Savior, Friend
Your mercy seems to have no end
And though all I have to bring is sin
I come to praise You

And my righteousness, is as filthy rags
But You exchange them for the good things that You have

(Chorus)

I want to show You just how much I love You
I want to love You with my life (4x)

(Chorus 2x)",Sacrifice,2002
Big Daddy Weave,"When you're lost and all alone
I will be your sure Way home
When you're left out in the cold
I will be your Shelter from the storm

When you're clouded by your doubts
You're surrounded and there's no other way out
I will be all that you need
And I'm here for the asking

[Chorus]
Let me be your Everything
Let me be your Everything
Look at all that I will bring
In exchange for what you have
Bring your sorrow bring your shame
Bring your suffering and your pain
Don't you know the price is paid
If only you'll let Me be
Let Me be your Everything

When you're wandering in the darkness
I will be the Light that guides you
And when Death is standing at your doorway
I will be the Life inside you

When you face your deepest fears
When you can't see through all the tears
I will stay year after year
So patiently waiting ... hear me saying ...

[Chorus]

Neither height nor depth, nor life or death
The angels above or the demons beneath the sea
Could ever separate you from
The love in me, so won't you let me be

[Chorus]",Be Your Everything,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Broken and poured out for the love of His creation
God paid a debt that He didn't owe
Bearing my pain for not one was His equal
And wearing my shame so that I could know him

He gave us all He had to give
So that we could truly live
So let's give all we have to Him
So that we can be completely free

And as they placed the thorns on His brow
As they drove the nails into His hands and His feet
He looked past the moment
To where we are now
And gave us the victory
From what seemed His defeat

He said here's my body
It's broken in two
Here is my blood let it cover you
All that I have is now yours to receive
Payment in full so that you could be free

Oh without a doubt completely
So that we can be completely free",Completely Free,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"You are Holy, God of the Heavens
Almighty. Lord of Creation
You have power the universe displays
All things fade away, but You remain

[Chorus]
And Your mercies stretch across my life
As far as I can see
And I know from experience
That You are good indeed
I stand here in amazement of
Your awesome majesty
For words cannot describe oh God
Everything You are to me

You are Father, You called me Your very own
My Redeemer, You left Heaven's throne
My ransom, with blood for me You paid
So one day unashamed I'll see Your face

[Chorus]

Indescribably good, Lord that's what You are to me
You are making me into just what You want me to be

You are Jesus, and I love You

[Chorus]",Everything You Are,2003
