Sweet Surrender,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
     
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
For you",Saving All My Love for You,2001
Sweet Tee,"(Rolling tape)
Hurby, my headphones are not loud enough
(Alright 
Yo Dre, pump it up somethin' 
How's that?)
Yeah, let's do this

Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move
It's the thriller to kill, cause I got nothin' to lose
I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin' at me
And oh, how they screamed (Go Sweet Tee!)

Just wanted nothin' but fun, cause I'm second to none
And I'm here in the flesh to show how it is to be done
So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop
And if your mom starts beefin', say, ""Mom, do the Whop""

Hop on the dance floor, dance to the music
Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it
I write rhymes, and to the world I'm givin'
(Get busy, Sweet Tee) That's the way I'm livin'

Leather or lace as I step in the place
People come to say hi cause they know my face
And you know I'm stylin', nails I'm filin'
Standin' on stage, smilin', profilin'

Lean, mean, breakin' out on the scene
Me and the girls steppin' fresh outta Queens
So if you want to have a ball, give me a call
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all

Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want
Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt
When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy
Some think I play games cause my name is Toi

Back to raise hell, I got records to sell
I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell
Never takin' a loss, weak rappers I toss
Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss

Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control
Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul
Never settle for less, god is my witness
Jog every day for physical fitness

Climbin' higher, I'll never retire
Rap so hot, they start three alarm fires
But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm
I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm

Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin' it
I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin' it
Five foot eight, standin' ten feet tall
And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all

Slam on the jam just as hard as you can
While I rock the mic with my all-girl band
And you know I'm clever, taken down never
Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror

My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set
'Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get
And I hope I'm told, when my record's old
That they all got sold, and my jam went gold

I give it all I got, and all I got I give
I take no shorts, that's the way I live
Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on
(Long live the queen) Well, I'm a live real long

I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me
Keep my beeper beepin', so the fellas don't lose me
Sly as a fox, sippin' juice on the rocks
When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped

When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better
Keep that in mind and don't you forget that
I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall
And you want to know why? It's like that y'all

Cruisin' down the street in my jett-black Volvo
Rockin' to the radio playin' [song name]
Heads all turn as I drive by
As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say (hi)

Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco
The music's pumpin' and the people screamin' (Ho!)
The place is packed and people shakin' their bodies
The crowd outside is screamin' (We want to party!)

Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began the rampage
They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-gauge
Rocked anyway, cause I'm bad, and I'm bold
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole

If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz
Toes are tappin' while I'm rappin', cause I'm in showbiz
Autographs I sign while they stand in line
I remain number one till I'm 109

I play no games, and you know I ain't frontin'
Let me know if you want to start a little somethin'
Why? Cause I'm a heavyweight, I go for it all
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all",It's Like That Y'all,1989
Sweet Tee,"Testin my mic one two one two 
I'm here to entertain yes this means you 
Don't need no help all by myself 
I proceed 'cause you need to enjoy yourself 
Try to compare? oh don't you dare 
'cause I'm sweeter than the cream in a french eclair 
Smoother than the ice in a skatin rink 
Have I forgotten anything? hm let me think 
Oh yes I take a pen draw you all in line 
You'll find that I'm a lyrical mastermind 
The more you scream, the more I strive 
So get live and put your body in overdrive 
Let's check the situation from a serious tip 
want to hear somethin wack? well, this ain't it 
'cause the beat is def and now you're told 
So prepare to work out a little rock and roll 
Lace them shoes, tighten up that belt 
And beware 'cause it's somethin that you never felt 
'cause it's ruffer than ruff, hipper than hip 
Don't be a drip, let it rip 
But on the smooth tip 

Toes are tappin, hands are clappin 
My deejay's on the cuts and Sweet Tee's rappin 
Rockin the spot 'cause the jam is hot 
You think i'm through? hm, not by a long shot 
I'm not a doctor, but I'm on call 
I'm not the police, so get off the wall 
In a club on stage to make you move 
A mic and a beat are the tools I use 
Yeah, I been crowned the gift of wax 
Sweet Tee's in the house, so just relax 
Give your hips a ride, give your feet some slide 
And do what you feel inside, you know 
It's easy to do if the beat is hip 
Dancin and swingin, if the needle don't skip 
Straight to the dancefloor, run, don't walk 
Move to the groove, let your body talk 
To me 'cause I happen to know what you like 
So when I pick up a pen I know what to write 
To hype the jam, so the jam'll hit 
So rock with Sweet Tee on the smooth tip 

Move that stuff, put your body in cruise 
Take it easy and slow, but make it smooth 
Gather around and get on down 
Ain't nothin like hangin when you got some sounds 
To this career I been ordained 
Doin things a anthropolgist can't explain 
Try if you will, I leave em stand still 
Rap better than me, that noise please kill 
Solve any crime like the great Dick Tracy 
Make more jazz than the late Count Basie 
Rhythmic sounds flow like Lake Eerie 
Alterin any scientifical theory 
Another like me well, I - never 
You know why? 'cause I'm too damn clever 
I'm the rap soloist that you can't resist 
Bust that, party people, then again, bust this 
It's time for my rhyme to reach the end of the line 
I hope you all had a groovy time 
Without further ado I'ma take my trip 
But remember Sweet Tee, y'all, on the smooth tip
",On the Smooth Tip,1990
Sweet Tee,"How shall I rock thee? 
Let me count the ways 

(1, 2, 3, 4 hit it) 
The bass is thumpin' the party is jumpin' 
I got the rhymes to keep your body pumpin' 
To keep you rockin' that's what I intend ta 
This ain't number one on the Sweet Tee agenda 
I'm gonna break it down so you can see 
The skillfull way I recite my poetry 
Quick as a flash I'll pop upon the scene 
Break out the Casio and the drum machine 
Got to get busy, cause I know I'm down 
As I tap into my instruments this funky sound 
Prone to make your body start to perspire 
As I turn the volume up higher and higher 
Grab my JVC, pop in a cassette 
Have the people stompin' to my beat, you bet 
Play it for my friends cause it sounds so neat 
And they ask (What do you call it?) It's My Beat 
(Ha, what?) It's My Beat 
It's my beat 

So take a minute and wipe your sweat 
But don't lose your tissue, cause I'm not done yet 
I'll jump on the stage, the crowd will come swarm in 
And through the bass bottoms my beat'll come stormin' 
In, like a beast, breakin' out of his cage 
Pursuin' eardrums with a deadly rage 
Cold kickin' ass, a blast from the past 
First in line, all you weak ones are last 
I'm simply novelist to say the least 
And if I want to be conceited, I'll hear myself, chief 
Ace lady rapper, cold queen of hip-hop 
Have the people screamin' (Sweet Tee, don't stop) 
Just gettin' busy, I'm tellin' you, baby 
Take it as a promise, no ifs, ands, or maybes 
Totally convinced, I wouldn't call it conceit 
But I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat 

I'm the entrepreneur of the hip-hop decor 
Have you people rampagin' and hit the dancefloor 
Freak to my melody, get hip to my beat 
As I display my rhymes so viciously, see 
Eh, I'm on the top, number one, yes uno 
Don't play stupid, cause I know that you know 
So go take the chance cause you don't want to miss 
Jazzy Joyce on the mix, rock my funky beat, bust this 
(It's in my shape 
About to work me to death) 
My beat is rough, but yet it's so tender 
Do the right thing, party people, surrender 
Go with the flow, cause I want you to know 
That the lady Sweet Tee is runnin' this here show 
Ain't nothin' to it but to go ahead and do it 
Don't need a pair of sneakers to run right through it 
Situation's stable, no question about it 
Me get rocked by who? I doubt it 
I'm only gonna tell you once, dog on it 
Do yourself a favor and g- g- get on it 
Super high post, I catch the beat with ease 
Demolishin' rappers while I'm shootin' the breeze 
So be on the look-out, Sweet Tee's comin'
Fast with the rhymes and twice as stunnin' 
Make my day and you face defeat 
Cause I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat 

(1-2-3-4 hit it) 
Due to circumstances you'll have to be aware 
That Sweet Tee and Jazzy Joyce are definitely here 
To stay on the top, right where we belong 
And if you think we can be taken, I'm sorry, you're wrong 
Quite confidentially I'm well aware 
That I'm talkin' out my face, but I just don't care 
Cause we're the ultimate, on the top, can't you see 
You better never ever sleep on Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee 
Jazzy Joyce (On the wheels) Jazzy Joyce (No one better) 
Jazzy Joyce (Speedin' faster than a '86 Jetta) 
Cold bloody terrorizin', baby, that you can bet 
(And if you battle me, never let me see you sweat) 
Yo, put on your glasses, so that you can see 
That's right, it's all about Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee 
Now you know about us, my voice real clear 
Peace out, yo, be easy, Jazzy Joyce, we're outta here",It's My Beat,1998
Sweet Tee,"I got this feelin', and it's makin' me break in-
to a cold sweat whenever I'm present
It doesn't matter how long
If you wasn't down from now on
You'll be around to count on
This feeling, put you down with the program
Like I am
So just dance till you feel how I feel now
Sweet Tee's cold rockin' the crowd
Turn up the music, I'm a fanatic
Make it heard from basement to attic
Keepin' you hooked like an addiction
Sweet Tee is fact, not fiction
On the records you hear me rhymin'
On the charts you see me climbin'
To the top of the deck, and I'm dealin'
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin'

Now's the time, so check your timex
Hold tight while I take you to the climax
Of the music, yeah, that'll work
Get on the dancefloor, go bezerk
Tee is here to let you know
That you others got to go
I'm steppin' hard, steppin strong
Step out my way or, get stepped on
I entertain, make you go insane
Stick with me when I'm on the mic, and
You'll feel no pain, I'll keep you up
Like a cup of Saeco
Get down like a sailboat anchor
I'm on a roll, and I'm wheelin'
I'm Sweet Tee, and I got the feelin'

Stop and - ehm, listen to the rhythm of
Sweet Tee, then fall in love
Cause I'm hype, Tee's on the mic
When I do it, I do it right
[Name] is on the cuts and
She makes party people shake their butts and
She gets busy, she ain't no joke
And with Tee on the mic - you know we dope
In demand, as I expand
I know how
So here and now
I'll take my stand
This ain't no game, I ain't playin'
Listen to the words I'm sayin'
At the top of the deck, and I'm dealin'
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin'

Now what I want you to do is
Get wet
Let yourself perspire
Get hot like your body's on fire
Get ready, so you can observe
The man with the beats - make it funky, Hurb

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it
Start sweatin', cause I'm lettin' me
Be real good, no one's forgettin' me
I'm good to go, yo
I'm not a amateur, Tee's a pro, so
I give no slack
Cause it's like that
I'll be back, jack
Cause I got the feelin'

If it feels good

Sweet Trip,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from 
Reflections of
The way life used to be

Sweet Vine,"For so long I've been told,
I am on the road to glory
These days I don't mind,
Just hearin' that old song 
Way back when at the tavern,
I would sit and write the stories
And now, everybody 
Just wants to sing along
And I'd wake-up early on Sunday morning,
And hear the church bells ringin' loud
Some man said we would all be singin'
Oh, can't you hear the sound..

[CHORUS:]
If you're lost and you can't find me,
(roll the mountainside)
Just leavin' all my friends behind me,
(roll the mountainside)
And if you're in need of my acquaintance,
The many miles that separate us.
(roll the mountainside)
The one day, for five and change,
I got mare than I bargained for
I found out that all-the-way 
Was a little-bit too far
And late last night on the trunk,
Cuttin' open the envelope
I found out when I woke-up,
I'd bought myself a car
Then I stayed-up dancin' 'til Sunday morning,
Just let the world go-out
Then someone said we would all be singin'
Oh, can't you hear the sound..

[CHORUS:]
Oh, we gonna climb that mountain... ah-ooh!
-guitar solo-
And I stayed-up dancin' 'til Sunday...,
And just let the world go down
Ooh, late tonight we gonna all be singin'...
Oh, can't you hear the sound...
(can't you hear the sound...sound...)
Sometime soon, down the road,
Call you up when I've had enough
Wrote-down in a motel room,
I'll send you all my love
I told you then, I'll tell you now
This here place is not my home,
No need to tie me down,
You can call me all your own...

Everything will be alright (everything will be just fine)
Everything will be just fine (everything will be alright)
Everything will be alright (everything will be just fine)
Everything will be just fine (everything will be alright)

Windows and your doors are closed
Seeing the world in black and white
Still singing the same old song
Don't know where you went wrong
Life is just the way it's always been

Three days, and forty miles away
Are the roads that life goes
Can't buy the way I've found
I want you here around
In the end, after all the cops are down

[Chorus]

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
And this is why
I don't trust myself with you
And this is why
I'm paying tomorrow

No, no those tears won't come
Well I'm so cold, cold
Tears won't come, no
Alright
No, no those tears won't come, no

Sweet Water,"Come out into the sun
Leave your coat at home, you don't need it
Step outside your bedroom door
Some kind of love is hard to find

And you're hard as nails
And cold as stone
But I've seen some cracks begin to show
If you've lost your spirit, I'll give you mine
If you've lost your spirit, I'll give you mine

I know you been pushed around
I know you been kicked around
But it's over now
Fill your pockets, take what you need
Just a crutch, to help you on your way
Past your dreams, into the unknown
Everybody needs a friend, don't be ashamed
You're no worse for the wear

I'll lick your wounds clean
I'll lick them clean
If you've lost your spirit, I'll give you mine
If you've lost your spirit, I'll give you mine
I know you been pushed around
I know you been kicked around
But it's over now
But it's over now

Let it go
Before it drags you down
Before it pulls you down
Let it go
Before it drags you down

I never want to be alone.
I never want to love no one.
I never want to be without you.
Can I lay next to you?
I never want to live without you.

Imagine loving someone so much;
Missing your smile, kiss, and touch.
To live alone without you I'd die.
I cry in fear of loneliness sometimes.
But I really believe my heart beats one life,
And it's you I choose.
I can't love another.
I never want to live my life without you.

[Chorus]

I'm never gonna give you up.
Living alone is not worth as much.
Without you I can't eat or sleep.
I close my eyes and it's you I see.
And every day that I breathe;
From the hightest mountain to the seas
I will be waiting...
Waiting for you to come to me.

[Chorus]

As I think and lay alone
I never want to hold no one.
I always dreamed one day you'd come,
Somehow, just to show me love.
And this time it's so real;
You tell me what you see and feel.
'Cause it's you I want.
'Cause I can't wake up to another love.

Sweethearts of the Rodeo,"Ohh, my you have a handsome face, you favor a man that I know
I imagine he's still in Tennessee, I know I should be there too
I've a sadness too sad to be true

But I left Tennessee in a hurry dear the same way that I'm leaving you
'Cause love is mainly just memories, everyone's got them a few
So when I leave I'll be glad to love you

At the brand new Tennessee waltz
You're literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee waltz
There's no telling who will be there

When I leave it'll be like I found your love descending Victorian stairs
I'm feeling like one of your photographs, trapped while putting on airs
And getting even by asking who cares

At the brand new Tennessee waltz
You're literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee waltz
There's no telling who will be there

So have your passionate violins, ooh, play a tune for a Tennessee Kid
Who's feeling like leaving another town with no place to go if she did
'Cause they'll catch you wherever you're hid

At the brand new Tennessee waltz
You're literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee waltz
There's no telling who will be there

Sweethearts of the Rodeo,"Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel, can we make it?
So that's part of the deal
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line

I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign?

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you see what I see?
Can you cut behind the mystery?
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind

I wanna come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me in these iron walls
We've got mountains to climb

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?

There he goes turning my whole world around

Sweethearts of the Rodeo,"Every minute of the day I'm thinking bout you
And without you life is just a crazy dream
Every breath I take I'm hoping that you're hoping
That I'm hoping you'll return to me
Do you remember dear when you said
If I ever stopped loving you you'd rather be dead
Well dear I don't know what on earth changed your mind
No matter who's holding you your heart is still mine

Everytime I think about the way
You'd cuddle up and spuddle up and thrill me with your charms
I get dizzy in the head and then it's seeming that I'm dreaming
I'm locked in your loving arms
Do you remember...

She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of countin' sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep

All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes
Everyday after school she'd head don't to the tracks
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true

Jenny laid a penny on the track one day
In God we trust she walked away

Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime

Inform you, knowledge born you

Tell ya sons and daughters
Behind the closed doors it's an old wise man
With the power of destruction at the palm of his hand
Understand, how it got there is this

Control the whole world through the power of trance

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.

The trees that line the street 
Could sense the winter change

He worked with stone, carved with stone

One sunny day he was sent to the Houses of Parliament
Chipping' away at the gargoyles 
Under the blistering sun 
He carved out ""Maggie Sucks"" on the backs of every one

They say why is Rizy chattin' about race
Why he breathin' bout air just like Hari K. say
My flow like a pony tail, so when I spit on a skinhead he becomes a Hare Krishna
Keep up with your feet or get them blisters
Like you're on the Tawaf by the Kaaba, that's the mission
Yo, call the feds, call the papers, my youth's gone missing
He's gone Iraq, he gone to Syria, he didn't listen
You got your mom in tears in Sajda Quran kissing
The politicians at the mic all bayaan giving
I pray for my nephew, I pray you're not antagonized by all the hating and news and the shit they sanitize
Look Zayn Malik's got more than eighty virgins on him
There's more than one direction to get to paradise
I'm in the galaxy far away
Rizy take his hand, usually write just one bar a day
Fresh back on the boat, I'm like the brown Marcus Garvey
Chat to Persian girls like ""Ba man ghaveh mikhori?""
I'm like hickory dickory, got them gyals on my brown stick like it's licorice

Yo, yo, yo, ay yo, ay yo, ay yo, hello, hello, hello, hello, no, no, no, no
Yo, I'm bumpin' Andre: hey ya, hey ya
Now I'm bumpin' chal chaaya chaaya they thuga thuga thuga thaaya thaaya
Now I'm bumpin' Hema: now playa playa
I am a beautiful hawk, I have big wings
I want a big house, I want big rings
I am an idiot, I want big things
Akbar Jahangir, I like big kings
I do my thing, they want to make me a prisoner
You out of place like a brown Hare Krishna
Shouts out my sister, I miss her
Shouts out your sister, I kiss her
I am a radiator, I am a toaster, I am a college dorm room poster

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they 
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

Swift,"I cast away everything I own for this feeling inside of me
Live my life for my home I'll be safe rather than be left alone
Feels like I can't live like I used to so I keep bringing new things

In this to improve the stature of my stance
At first glance it seems so hard to figure
Protect my home I hate to but I'm forced to kill
Two birds with one stone

So fly away
Just fly away
Fo' find your place
While I stay
I can't stand these claws
Reaching for my things
I'll clip your wings

You sing the same song all the other birds sing
Pictures and memories take place
And in due time they wither away
And all that's left are the feeling that we had

In reverse
Stay away while you are here
My life's not mine
When you look down from above
Wishing you could fly with me
I'm bound by the same things
I'm not free

I'm just sticking to the path that belongs to me
It belongs to me",Birds,2002
Swift,"Last night, all smiles, we were holding hands.
And now you, won't share the bed with me,
Explain if you can.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.

Taken by surprise, because I felt so secure.
Because all the things, that you've done,
Have let me wondering.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.

You leave me breathless with your words

We can say that we've changed, together,
Another day--give me your hand, let me
Explain, because I've come to terms with
Who you are.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this-your grip
Is too tight--let's not fight. your grip is too,
Is too--tight.

You leave me breathless with your words.



",Breathless,2002
Swift,"Killed--but I'm still struggling, to hold on to
You--I know I'm failing. it feels like my arms
Are tied to my hips, and I, just tripped I'm
Falling--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

It felt so warm with you and now my own bed
Feels foreign to me--I guess I just hate things,
That are empty and I'm sleepy--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

It seems like my world is falling to it's end,
It seems like the color gray.

Pictures in perfect color with words to listen to,
That's the scene I saw--and now, that my hope is
Crushed, and fingernails are gone, I'm bleeding--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

Please don't hold out on me, the distance can't be
That far, it can't be--this is confusing me, what's
Wrong with me? what's wrong, with me?

I'm not lovesick or could I be? I'm so--confused
What's wrong with me?



",Lovesick,2002
Swift,"Words like violence, break the silence.
Come crashing in, into my little world.
Painful to me, pierce right through me.
Can't you understand, oh my little girl.
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms. words are very 
Unnecessary, they can only do harm.
Vows are spoken, to be broken. feelings 
Are intense, words are trivial, pleasures 
Remain, so does the pain. words are 
Meaningless, and forgettable.
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed,
Is here in my arms. words are very 
Unnecessary, they can only do harm.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Mr. porter, the kon artis (ha!)
I told you we wasn't leavin, c'mon! 

I come from a jungle, with a trunk load of punk hoes (nigga)
Muzzle this animal, fuck with mechanical
Gun totin hazardous cutthroat, cantaloupe can split it
And the pope couldn't prevent me from shittin on niggaz
Fitted caps get blew back like bad wind, imagine backspinnin'
Into a casket, it happens when bastards try to act masculine (hoe)
A hell raiser, I smack the skin off your man's face
So fast it'll leave acne on my hand when it land (hah!)
Placed in a class where professors came to school with smith 'n wessons
Just to teach us a lesson, had that ass hangin' up with the flag (yeah)
Parental discretion, I'll send you a video
With me naked havin a session on my urinal (respect it! Hah!)
When you kill in the nighttime and claimin' yo' innocence
I'll be waitin' ready to a. K. you and yo' egg bene-dick 
Usin' yo' balls to play tennis with (hah)
You'll be in some shit like flies and fuck the witnesses

(Motherfuck!) niggaz that doubt and thought we wasn't killin' shit
(What!) whatever you want, we providin' it diligently
(Pump!) double barrel wherever we go willingly
(Dumpin!) on opposition in the streets or industry

You was born I was hatched, but you came out deformed
I have nuts of a horse, and you ain't got no balls
Come runnin' with tec-9's whenever niggaz would call
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang, shoot up classway halls
I don't give a fuck, who you call to come
You came with thirty niggaz, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a nigga got in me
You gone off henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
Situations you in, don't get that ""purple pills"" shit confused
With us bein cool up here singin ""my band""
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a fuckin autograph
So say that shit loud enough out of the fuckin crowd and
I'll show you the meanin' of die-hard fans
Saddam hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that mitchell and ness
So find your spinal cord, uh-uh-oh I digress

Swim Deep,"C'mon man we got nothing on our time
Throw your ties away untuck your life
'Cause I've had my head in the sand
And it feels like waiting
I want my head in the clouds
If the clouds ain't raining

Life ain't beige so colour your days
See it in the right light
Stop waiting go vacate
And see it in the right light
You gotta see it in the right light

Throw it out if you feel like you've got time
Pick it up if there's something on your mind
'Cause I've had my head in the sand for a while now lately
Do I want my head in the clouds if the clouds is raining?

I won't tell anyone baby if
you wanna frown
Just don't ever say maybe

For not doing what makes you tick.
Don't blame the clock on the wall for running round
With nothing at all

So I say oh oh baby
Take your feet out your shoes and go crazy
Don't just dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Are we having a fight, or are we dazing?

I wanna go down south and hold onto your feelings lately
I wanna hear you growl but who's gonna be there to save me

And you feel like you'll never die

The darkest skies
And the compass in your heart will spin
