Ella Fitzgerald & Her Orchestra,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,
Ella Fitzgerald & Her Orchestra,"Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
Talk about things you'd like to do.
You got to have a dream,
If you don't have a dream,
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about the moon floatin' in the sky
Lookin' at a lily on the lake;
Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly.
Makin' all the music he can make.

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
Talk about things you'd like to do.
You got to have a dream,
If you don't have a dream,
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about the sparrow lookin' like a toy
Pickin' through the broaches of a tree;
Talk about the girl, talk about the boy
Countin' all the ripples on the sea.

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
Talk about things you'd like to do.
You got to have a dream,
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about the boy sayin' to the girl:
""Golly, baby, I'm a lucky cause.""
Talk about the girl sayin' to the boy:
""You an' me is lucky to be us!""

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
Talk about things you'd like to do.

And you never have dream,
Then you'll never have a dream come true!",Happy Talk,

I don't care what he does
Cause he's my guy
I guess he always was
He careless about me
I don't think he tries
But once in a while 
he'll hug me and smile
Then I can see me in his eyes

Oh he's my guy
I know he'll always be
And I will try
To keep him loving me
However he wants me
I'm his until I die
For nobody knows better than I

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How high the moon
Is the name of this song
How high the moon
Though the words maybe wrong
We're singin' it because you ask for it
So we're swingin' it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach out to mars

Ella Fitzgerald & Her Orchestra,"'Neath the stars, at bazaars
Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four

You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower
Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour

Drop him in the nearest ditch

She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind

How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

[Chorus]

He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more

Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
No insurance could she find

I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,

I got to love one man till I die.

Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).

But when he comes back that day is fine,

Home without him ain't no home to me.

An' good for nothing too

When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.

He kin be happy

If I thought you'd ever change your mind

I would bring you happiness
Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
I would bring you summer rain and rainbow skies to make your garden grow
And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold

But what use of flowers in the morning
When the garden they should grow in is not mine
And what use is sunshine if I'm crying
And my falling tears are mingled with the wine

I would bring you happiness
Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
I would bring you rainbow skies
And summer rain to make your garden grow
And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold

I would bring you flowers in the morning
Wild roses when the sun begins to shine
Winter fruits and summer wine
Sweet perfume and columbine

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Alone where we have walked together

Can't believe the timing
Yesterday you're smiling
I guess we both played our parts
Very entertaining
But it's such a shame
That we lost our way
From the nights we danced
The bands were playing
I say I'm over you
But I'm not sure that it's true

I am falling
And I'm too weak to fly
Now my heart's wide open
And you're the reason why
I've been broken
From the scars that I forgave
Spent a long time running
From the mess we've made
And oh
But I'd do it all again

Come on, heart let me in
Days can be so bright
And our way can be alight
And we both know
So don't pretend
Makes it all so hard
When I see that we're far from
The way we were
Oh the nights we danced
The bands were playing
I say I'm over you
But I know that's not true

'Cause I am falling
And I'm too weak to fly
Now my heart's wide open

From the scars that I forgave
I spent a long time running

And oh

If I found a way just to hit rewind
Would it be enough to change your mind
And this time I'll make you stay
And I remember how we used to be
Giving you up ain't so easy
But since you walked away

I am falling
And I'm too weak to fly
Now my heart's wide open
And you're the reason why

You brought the hurricane into my life
Here's the truth, I want to know
How it feels on your own
Just blurry images of us in mind

How could you be kind but still so cruel?

Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight
And though my mind is always changing
Won't you give my heart a break?
Try to fix the broken pieces once again
Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away

Nothing could feel the same between us two
You seemed to want me now I don't want you
I used to fall in the trash
Hard to find my way back
And now you hate it that I wear the shoes

I used to cry, I used to worry
But now you say you're so damn sorry
How could you pretend to be so real?

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Holding hands and yawning, 
Look how late it gets. 
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light, 
And too much in love to say goodnight. 

Here we are, in a cozy chair; 
Pickin' on a wishbone from the frigidaire. 
Two sleepy people with nothing to say, 
And too much in love to break away. 

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall? 
Your father didn't like me at all. 
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall? 
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest.

Told the tale to me

From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow

Out where the lightning splits the sea

Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the raging flood
Oh his approach is like the fire in my blood

He was sittin' on a piano stool

I'm a-shoutin' hurray

Instead of holdin' hands;
He showed them how to steal a kiss
Like they do in foreign lands.

Until he came along,
Just think what they were missin';
Love was very nice,
But as cold as ice
Till that guy invented kissin'!

And roll their pretty eyes;
He showed them how to kiss hello
And how to kiss goodbye.

Until he came along,
Just think what they were missin';
They could only cook
Or read a book

Mister Bell the telephone,
And Columbus found America,
There names are all well known.

There was nothin' to do
Till that guy invented kissin'!

And how to kiss goodnight;

He holds the copyright!

And a candy apple caddy
A bank account and everything
Accustomed to the finer things

And then he's drunk
And never even told her that he cared

Local bus tonight, good evening

A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I can feel it start, then it melts away

I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
""Is this the day?""

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Well, now you've heard my story 'bout a place I know

A lover and a best friend
Someone to forgive me when I’m so wrong
And remind me what welcome home

And anywhere can be home

A sink full of brand new dishes

There ain’t impossible, no

I ain't afraid, knowin’ shit’s gotta change
One day it’ll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn’t see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasn’t home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment that’ll change my life
I don’t never wanna wake up, turn off the lights

To them haters middle finger, up to yo face
Facing so many problems, hate being tested
From a place where they waiting to see me arrested
No rest, tryna make it where I wanna go
Alumni but I couldn’t make the honor roll
Too cool for school, I’m too rude for Jude
There’s no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, well I keep it 100
Mo money, mo problems keep on coming
Tryin, a nigga go back but these niggas keep frontin
Right now everything going right, it could fuck up tonight though
Said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go

I just don’t know when we goin
It’s crazy how the devil gets us when we heaven-sent
My hands already red, I lost so many men
Heavy is the head that bares the crown that I’m wearin man
I was a loser just tryna fit and I let em in
But those were school days, I grew up, now I’m on Letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact I’m reading inside these letters man
Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother
Open it up, a razor felt, it was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?
Rap was just a dream baggy jeans, burning blank CD’s, feed em to the streets
Would you let adversity as you are, come for money

And I'm about to get so messed up like I really need that

Is this a party
Or what?

'Cause I've been here for much, too long
I don't really wanna dance
And I hate most of these songs
Plus my feet are killing me

I'm sittin' on this couch and my cellphone checking your name
Driving myself bat-shit crazy, going insane

You don't listen, now you singing this damn sorry, song
We coulda stayed home and watched Martin
Bruh Man from the 5th floor with the milk of carton
Comin' through your window, we pillow talkin' util the morning
Hit the studio, making love, skits and let you recorded
Put it on your album, that shit'll be so retarded
Damn your pretty body I just wanna polaroid it
Blow it up, put it on my wall so we can both enjoy it
Taking it down if my friends come over so they don't focus on it
'Cause I'm selfish with my baby, never felt this from a lady
Got me going crazy, all them clubs janky
And you need to get back home to me
Giving your body a massage with the cozy feet
New perfume, earlobes are sweet
Forget them ghetto ass clubs with the phony VIPs

Waiting where I left you

She tasted like a peach and her eyes were green
I’m headed to the beach take this ride with me
And don't babysit the weed bitch get high with me
Jagged Edge played her legs spread
She said she needed me inside of her
She held me tighter, told her, “Pass the weed
Pull your panties to your feet
Just don’t ruin my seats, you little freak""
Now it’s been years of creeping
And I’ve been thinking about forever lately
Your body feel like heaven baby
Come and save me

It’s me, it’s me baby

I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)

Man, how you gonna leave me like that?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon’ get right back
At least I thought so
I guess your negative energy and your insecurities
Drew me to drawing a blank
I got a new thing, and everything is straight
Wait, you wasn’t even the only one in the first place
Couldn’t even say if you knew better, you'd do better
Cause you knew better, and you still acting like a bitch
Texts all day but don’t say shit
It’s okay boo, I don’t blame you
I know that this backwards society raised you
Taught you to play on your phone and watch cable
So while I play on your mind like I’m a Jedi
I’m probably eating a ribeye, finna hop on a red eye
Rolling up the green that shit that give you them red eyes
You is a bad bitch, it’s just time to say goodbye

Ellegarden,"I should have peace of mind
But I get lost and retrace my steps
And time just passes

The memories keep piling up
And crash noisily to the ground
We'll turn today into a memory, too

I missed seeing the rainbow
Because I walked with my head down
So as not to break the thin ice

There were roads I didn't hesitate to take
It was scarier
To lose the freedom to go anywhere

The memories keep piling up
And crash noisily to the ground
We'll turn today into a memory, too
Even if mistakes and disagreements
Tear us apart
We'll turn today into a memory, too

To see the first falling star of the year
And thought, maybe it's okay like this

But there's always someone faster

I'm trying to live a bit seriously
But what's on my mind is you know always girls
Vitaminize me
Pass me the potato chips

You know what When nothing's going right
You know what It's like a magic thing

I got the music playing loud in my head
I got a red hot chili blows it away
I got the music playing loud in my head

It could be less or maybe the same as you

I know nicotine kills
But quitting smoking kills me now

As always no one understands
As always I'll do anything

Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it

To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point

We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of lois lane
And you could be my boyfiend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppoose
Flyin through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here an I'm there I'm big bang hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel motel what you gonna do today(say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
You say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my oj
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house 
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin here makin myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say hank can ya rock
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
I said come on 
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said sit down punk I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
So from sixty six til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that's called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a god d--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker mc's can bite all night
A tick a tock why'all a beat beat why'all
A lets rock why'all ya don't stop
Ya go hotel motel whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin
Drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friends
A like that why'all to the beat why'all
Beat beat why'all ya don't stop
A master gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do

Well like johnny carson on the late show
A like frankie croker in stereo
Well like the barkay's singin holy ghost
The sounds to throw down they're played the most

Its like my man captain sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off why'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl get on your feet
A like a perry mason without a case
Like farrah fawcett without her face

Like the barkays on the mike
Like gettin right down for you tonight
Like movin your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down

Like comin alive to the master gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doin the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rockin to the sounds of the master gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Givin all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the master gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was a pickin up sticks
Rappin to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rockin in heaven dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Gettin right on down makin all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was right on time
Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Goin on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A saying on n n on n on on n on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mike
I am the definite feast delight
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mike
I am the definite feast delight

Ellen Allien,"Time is like a bullet from behind
I run for cover just like you
Time is like a liquid in my hands
I swim for dry land just like you

Time is like a blanket on my face
I try to be here just like you
Time is just a fiction of our minds
I will survive and so will you

We are the only ones right now that are celebrating
And we are joining hands right now
We are the only ones right now that are suffocating
We are the dying ones right now

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars

Kisses on the dancefloor in my past
I need some comfort just like you
Beating like a bass drum time goes by
I want the last dance just like you

Drowning in the flood of morning light
I'm only human just like you
Do you hear the city waking up
I will survive and so will you

We are the ones the only ones
We are the ones the dying ones
We are the ones the only ones
We are the ones and we are joining hands
We are the only ones right now that are celebrating

Like the mountains in springtime,
Like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert,
Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Ellen Demos,"What of a morning
That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently
We set apart
Things of the heart
And lost love long ago",Morning,
Ellen Demos,"It's 3 miles to the river,
That would carry me away,
And 2 miles to the dusty street,
That I saw you on Today,

It's 4 miles to my lonely room,
Where I will hide my face,
And about a half a mile to the downtown bar,
That I ran from in disgrace,

Lord how long do I have to keep on running,
Seven hours, Seven days or Seven years,
All I know is since you've been gone,
Feels like I'm drowning in a river,

Drowning in a river of tears,
Drowning in a river,
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river,

In 3 more days Ill leave this town,
And disappear without a trace,
A year from now maybe settle down,
Where no one knows my face,

I wish that I could hold you,
One more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again,

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here,
You'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears,
Drowning in a river,

Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river
Oh how long must this go on,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears",River of Tears,

Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin here makin myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie

Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said sit down punk I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
So from sixty six til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that's called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a god d--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker mc's can bite all night

And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again  Everybody go

The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got

And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn

They're all giggles and sighs

The club's hot and sweaty and heads start to stare
But nobody cares...It's their favorite band

But you, you're a loner heading out with the crowd
And everybody knows that it's kinda hard to get by
When you're so nervous and shy
You're just a loner heading out with the crowd
Looking for a love that could take you down with his

To keep us strong
To take us far
Far away from the pain of the days

Ellen Foley,"Well I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

C'mon Hold on tight
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Well ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Baby don't you hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
Well I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I want to make your motor run

Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth,
There's the windup, and there it is,
A line shot up the middle, look at him go.
This boy can really fly
He's rounding first and really turning it on now,
He's not letting up at all,
He's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center,
And here comes the throw, and what a throw
He's gonna slide in head first,
Here he comes, he's out
No, wait, safe-safe at second base,
This kid really makes things happen out there.
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going,
And what a jump he's got, he's trying for third,
Here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third
Holy cow, stolen base, he's taking a pretty big lead out there,
Almost daring him to try and pick him off.
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted,
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw, here's the play at the
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore, that I would love you to the end of time
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my life with you

The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies

""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Lots of coal makin' lots of heat
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still
I would never move till Spring crept over mi window sill

Warm and tender as he can be

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are seventeen, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one,
The one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there will be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again,
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we still be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal
An animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll color in the sky, and I'll color you
I want to join your skin again, again,
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we still be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away

Ellie Goulding,"Listen
I can hear a voice
I need a helping hand
Just to beat the void
I need a mission
A dream to stop me talking to myself

And now the silence is broken
And my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces
To scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears
You can hear the wind come in

But you can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own
Heart beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me

Don't let it slip, through your fingertips
When there's a ghost
Don't try to reason with it
Because now I'm tired
I'm wired
So I won't miss a think
I rope my words out to dry
And I've forgotten what to sing
But you can't change the world
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do

You won't see me again

For all the times I saved we were together

This will always be my home
This will always be my home

I work until its late
Will again close the gates
I look in the window and I gaze on my face
Every line and every abrasion
This took my life to make

Than I could ever build or create,
You know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me

I hope I will get the chance to be someone,
To be human,
Look what we've done,
Look what we've done

I would give my life, to be human
I would give my life, to be human

Human I'm trying to come clean,
I will be a better me,
I will not drink until I'm dead
I'll make the most of it.
I don't know what it's like to be alive,
To say goodbye,
To cry a thousand tears
Because my ears won't listen

Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in you,
I've sussed out all that I've seen through,
I've sailed an ocean

I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared,
I hope I will get the chance to be someone
To be human,
Look what we've done,
Look what we've done

The sound of my heart breaking.
The truth is waiting to be found,
I trust that I will take it

And though the most formidable journey lies ahead
Only one will prevail
Wonder, Wonder, Wonderman

These haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special,

Uh yeah and I went from the kid in class
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust

Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin' up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans, cement for sand
Raise your hand the Wonderman

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall
And cant afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes
Imagine satisfaction when you make it

Its more than being famous
More then the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in 20 foreign places
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises
Amen hallelujah 'Tinie look what's happened to ya?
Yeah they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeah

And when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little brag or two
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya

Come on come on follow your heart is gonna take you home

Fight fires in your best clothes, touch skin with your eyes closed
Chase thunder
With the volume down
Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town
Force quit, on your losing streak
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek
Tell me that we're still too young, that we're still too young and I'll my tongue

Until you see me in your dreams
We'll stay awake beneath the trees
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take
The only branch I'll never break
Those fears we'll blow them all way

I'm here, I'm here to save you
No fall, I will swim to save you

Until you see me in your dreams
We'll stay awake beneath the trees
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take

Those fears we'll blow them all way",I'll Hold My Breath,2010
Ellie Goulding,"You're sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove
That is no way to live that is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again

You're as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created
Just to understand
The meaning (of)

Hands on strings and my mouth open
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to

For all of the times that I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again
But when it came back,
I didn't know my own name

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created
Just to understand
The meaning (of)
Of, of

Ellie Goulding,"Who are we to be emotional
Who are we to play with hearts
And throw away it all
Who are we to turn each others heads
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds
I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
I don't think you know me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores
Oh I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh I don't think you warned me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This heart will never be yours

Ellie Goulding,"Why can't we speak another language
One we all agree on
When men look outside, they see houses
Instead of the fields they grew from
We are constantly uprooted from them
Making us tiresome (and fearful)
Can you get up right now
Endeavor to free fall?

You can fall if you want to!
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our hometown,
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,
And it has been found wondering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline,
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,
The carelessness of running away
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

Patterns all arranged in my background
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent
With no addresses so that people can't discover
That we're always under cover
Why do I always draw triangles?
Instead of words this paper deserves

I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find

With that skipping rope, the trampoline,
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,
The carelessness of running away
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

You can fall if you want to!
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our hometown,
But you've forgotten where you are

Ellie Goulding,"You wait for a silence
I wait for a word
Lie next to your frame
Girl unobserved
You change your position
And you are changing me
Casting these shadows
Where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body
I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say?
'Cause I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me

Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs
This isn't the place for those violin strings
I try out a smile and I aim it at you
You must have missed it
You always do

But I've got a plan
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say?
'Cause I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me

You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows

Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay?

Ellie Goulding,"Take cover
Signs don't show
You drove me
Off the road

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move
Move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained

Wipe the mud spray from the face stop the engine
Stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine,
Stop pretending, that you're still breathing

Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?

I've been trying to hide
We held our breath
To see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year
I knew the panic was over

Yes since we found out
Since we found out
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need it's palette and we need it's color
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river
Cover your eyes

And I gave in
I lack the things you need the most
You said where have you been
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king
The rules you set are still untold to me and I
Lost my faith in everything
The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same

And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
'Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion
I pray that you will find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you, another time

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same",Explosions,2012

I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me
I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone

Ellie Goulding,"Is this our world?

I look in the mirror
I can't get over you
Is this our world?
Is it someone else?
Is it someone else?

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
Wherever look terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the thoughts I started
I try to be nearer

To where you are
To where you are

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where do these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cuz I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Watch the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You read my heart
You read my heart

Ellie Goulding,"""Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow""

I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents

My high school reunion might be worth an appearance

Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive

And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight.

Behind the dark sky you looked at me.
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded evergreen

I think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just 'cause I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
'Cause she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here, yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all

There's nothing left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end

Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in their ragged clothes
The silver thorn of the bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will",Vincent,2018

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Elliot Levine,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

We could fake the world out (x3)

Of light here she shines on me.

To say she's here tonight,
Just know she's bringing in, 
She's bringing in the light.

Oh she likes to lead,
Every way she lead me on,
She took the ground beneath my feet,
And drew me closer to the sun,
My mind is spinning right to the edge,
I'm veering out of control,
She gracefully reels me in,
And oh, here she comes, here she goes.

Elliott,we're keeping up the fiction and breaking all the mirrors. we're bringing our own troubles by neglecting the cracks we walk on. the daystar is burning in this black cofin we move in. we tried to make it work out hundreds of miles apart. hyou are the luckiest symbol i've ever found and i'm a world away. we are the final students in the dying art of lost astrology. you are the brightest single shining star i saw from miles away. it's superstitious but i keep on wishing on all the falling stars on hold for me. you keep on pulling and causing tension but you're the magnet. if we never find the way home i'd be more than lost without you and to all the skeptic onlookers we should have never made it this far.,Superstitions in Travel,2000

Elliott,"Hey the sound is foreign. Coming from in. 
You knew at the start, you'd lose what you owned if you were, to carry on. 
Carry on, you better know just where you are. 
Carry on, carry on, you better know when. 

The sooner you go, the sooner you'll know when to stop. 
Carry on, carry on, you better know just where you are. 
Carry on, carry on, you better make tracks. 
Carry on without me, carry on if you can.

When you needed an hour
Just to push it aside

Could have made you forget

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
And then we'd build it up again

And we're burning all the bridges now

Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it
Guess I made it too easy

If any word that you said could have made me forget
Would I get up off the floor

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

Dreaming about Andy Warhol

Wondering if that's moral
But hey look at you now
You've got everything that a girl could want
You've got high heel slippers baby but that's all right

Hollywood
Hollywood

You shaped my life with Technicolor carving knife and
Now I don't know what to feel
All my emotions are wrapped up reel to reel

You know you turned me around stuck my face in the ground
When I sat down on Garbo's sofa
And I like some James Dean clown that you can make laugh
or frown - I just want to know when it's over

But hey look at me now you know just can't find nothing real
And the movies are all outside baby but that's all right

Hollywood
You gave me the best I got this
Soundtrack of violence and sex
and
Now I don't know who to be
Cause every time I look in the
mirror I see some movie star
You know it just doesn't look
like me

That what she's been seeing in the movies just ain't the same

And who sets the motion
Of the human race

And the legless Vietnam survivor
He's trying to find a job or a wife
Cause he can't find peace with honor
As he gets conditioned to his wheelchair life
And the killers still run the country
And they count their money
With their bloodstained hands

Maybe it s time we really took a stand

In love with you tonight
All I need is a little push
And I'm heading over the top

It's not a question of what I want to do 
It's a question of what's right

On this quiet Sunday night

Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
For dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low
Searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin' out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
She said ÒI don't want nobody see me talkin' to youÓ
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand
Steps goin' down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
To find dignity

And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper out of you

Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered 
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do

Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue

Elliott Smith,"I'll tell you why I
Don't wanna know where you are
I gotta joke I've been dying to tell you
Silent kid is looking
Down the barrel
To make the noise that I kept so quiet
Kept it from you, Pitseleh

I'm not what's missing
From your life now
I could never be the puzzle pieces
They say that God makes problems
Just to see what you can stand
Before you do as the Devil pleases
Give up the thing you love

But no one deserves it

The first time I saw you
I knew it would never last
I'm not half what I wish I was
I'm so angry
I don't think it'll ever pass
And I was bad news for you just because
I never meant to hurt you",Pitseleh,1998
Elliott Smith,"I got a question mark
You got a need to always take some shot in the dark
I don't have to make pretend the picture I'm in is totally clear
You think that all things have a way they ought to appear

'Cause you know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know you know 
I don't 
I dream

Don't know what you mean
Panic called you out and took you in
Giving you an easy game and letting you win
You're giving back a little hatred now to the world

'Cause it treated you bad
'cod you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad
'Cause you know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know you know

I don't
I dream
Don't know what you mean
Said your final word, but honesty and love could've kept us together

One day you'll see it's worth it after all
If you ever want to say you're sorry you can give me a call",A Question Mark,1998
Elliott Smith,"Cut this picture into you and me
Burn it backwards, kill this history
Make it over, make it stay away
Or hate'll sing the ending that love started to say

There's a kid a floor below me saying
""Brother, can you spare sunshine for a brother, Old Man Winter's in the air""
Walked me up a story, asking how you are
Told me not to worry, you were just a shooting star

Sweet Adeline
Sweet Adeline
My Clementine

It's a picture-perfect evening and I'm staring down the sun
Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
Or any situation where I'm better off than dead",Sweet Adeline,1998
Elliott Smith,"Everybody knows which way you go straight to over no one
Wants to see you inside of me straight to over I heard the
Hammer at the lock say you're deaf and dumb and done give
Yourself another talk this time make it sound like someone the

Noise is coming out, and if it's not out now, then tomorrow
Tomorrow they took your life apart and called you failures art
They were wrong though they wont know 'til tomorrow I got
Static in my head the reflected sound of everything tried to go

To where it led but it didn't lead to anything the noise is
Coming out, and if it's not out now, I know it's just about to
Drown tomorrow out",Tomorrow Tomorrow,1998
Elliott Smith,"Everytime the day darkens down
And goes away, pictures open
In my head of me and you

Silent and cliche all the things
We did and didn't say
Covered up, by what we did and didn't do
Going through

Every hour I used to cope to make
The repetition stop
What was I supposed to say?

Oh

Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone
I'm going home
I wish I'd never seen your face",Waltz #1,1998
Elliott Smith,"First the mic then a half cigarette
Singing Cathy's clown
That's the man that she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed, so she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
Now she's done and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memories remote
'cos I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is the revenge to the tune
""You're no good,
You're no good you're no good you're no good""
Can't you tell that it's well understood
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
I'm tired
I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
Xo, mom
It's ok, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell mr. man with impossible plans to just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow",Waltz #2 (XO),1998
Elliott Smith,"Everybody cares, everybody understands
Yes everybody cares about you
Yeah and whether or not you want them to
It's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head
To a pure synthetic sympathy that infuriates you totally
And a quiet lie that makes you want to scream and shout
So here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining it's guiding light upon everyone

For a moment's rest you can lean against the banister
After running upstairs again and again 
From wherever they came to fix you in 
But always fear the city's finest follow right behind
You got a pretty vision in your head
A pencil full of poison lead
And a sickened smile illegal in every town
So here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining its guiding light upon everyone
Here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining its guiding light upon everyone
You say you mean well, you don't know what you mean
Fucking ought to stay the hell away from things you know nothing about",Everybody Cares Everybody Understands,1998
Elliott Smith,"I'll fake it through the day
With some help from johnny walker red
Send the poison rain down the drain
To put bad thoughts in my head

Your two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, miss misery
Like you say you do?

A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong
Hardly ever wrong I said man you mean

You had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine
That you left lying around

I don't have you with me but
I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, miss misery
Like you say you do?

I know you'd rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway
Next door the TV's flashing

Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy of errors, you see
It's about taking a fall
To vanish into oblivion

Is easy to do
And I try to be but you know me 
I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me miss misery

Like you say you do?",Miss Misery (Bonus Track) [*],1998
Elliott Smith,"Here's the silhouette 
The face always turned away
The bleeding color gone to black
Dying like a day
Couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy
Shook your head to say no no no
And stopped for a spell
And stayed that way
Oh well, okay

I got pictures, I just don't see it anymore
Climbing hour upon hour through a total bore
With the one I keep where it never fades
In the safety of a pitch black mind
An airless cell that blocks the day
Oh well, okay

If you a get a feeling the next time you see me
Do me a favor and let me know
'Cause it's hard to tell 
It's hard to say

it turns me on

Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue
it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Ah, ah, ah, ah",Because,1999
Elliott Smith,"You got your head turned 'round walking upside down
Through the sunken dream
Through the crushing crowd
You don't know what it means 'cause you're a broken machine
You won't lisp it out
You're dressing up your man
It's all second hand
It's all hindsight
You don't understand
It's just an empty scene
It's still an empty scheme
You want to block it out
But I know what I'm gonna do with this big doubt
I'm gonna make it go away
When you go walking out in 
The rose city
Without a fucking clue
With an attitude
Knowing what you need
What you will not do
The enemy is you
You beat up on yourself 'cause there ain't no one else
Who feels quite as good to put straight through hell
You know yourself well
You know what you're about
Just want to block it out
Well, I know what I'm gonna do with this big doubt
I'm gonna hide my face away
Block it out
Well, I know what I'm gonna do with this big doubt
I'm gonna make it go away",The Enemy Is You,1999
Elliott Smith,"Every time the day
Darkens down and goes away
Pictures come
Into my head of me and you
Silent and cliched
All the things we did
And didn't say covered up
By what we did and didn't do
I thought you knew
Now i take it from the top
And make the repetition stop
It never ever went away

Now I'm scared to leave my zone
We're both alone
I'm coming home
I wish I'd never seen your face",Waltz #1 [Demo Version],1999
Elliott Smith,"There was grown man dying from fright
So surprised by the things he'd say
With a giant fantasy life
Running 'round on feet of clay

Naked except for a perpetual debt
That couldn't be stripped away
An unrightable wrong that moved him
Along closer to division day

Spent a long time living with that
Never could give it a name
And when you don't know what you're
Looking at it makes it much harder to take

Mostly they'd meet when he was
Asleep and have some sick exchange
That stuck him as wrong and moved him
Along closer to division day

I can't make an exception for a bad
Connection that only goes one way
Sell out for a song where I don't belong
With you on division day

The moon stood up on the ridge
Looking down where the water shines
And a man looking over the bridge
Like he done so many times

Thinking about how to stay out
Out of troubles way and
Flying to fall away from you all
It's over division day
Beautiful division day

Elliott Smith,"You've got the wrong equation
Your figures fell so you make more up
All's false in celebration
If only you could just change your luck
This time we can't lose
This time we can't lose
You're pushing nine you're doing pretty
But you're playing with the sound turned down
We drive along between the cows and cotton
Saying with the stars all around
This time we can't lose
This time we can't lose
The moon is in a sickle shape
You know you're only really happy just for now
Looked at the city scape
Well there's a planet that'll catch you and drag you back down

This time we can't lose
This time we can't lose

The hero killed the clown
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

Still hanging around
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

The slow motion moves me 
The monologue means nothing to me

Bored in the role, but he can't stop
Standing up to sit back down
Or lose the one thing found
Spinning the world like a toy top 
'Til there's a ghost in every town
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

Sir, no sir, we have no power in the air
The battle's on the ground

Laying low again, high on the sound
Bruno S. is a man to me
You're just some dude with a stilted attitude
That you learned from TV
You'll undo, but I'll be connecting everything

Elliott Smith,"You'll take advantage 'til you think you're being used
'Cause without an enemy your anger gets confused
I got stuck on the side you know I never chose
But it's all about taking the easy way out for you I suppose

There's no escape for you except in someone else
Although you've already disappeared within yourself
The invisible man who's always changing clothes
It's all about taking the easy way out for you I suppose

While I watch you making mistakes
I wish you luck, I really do
With the problem, with the puzzle
Whatever's left of you

I heard you found another audience to bore
A creative thinker who imagined you were more
A new body for you to push around and pose

Elliott Smith,"Someone found the future as a statue
In a fountain 
At attention looking backward in a
Pool of water

Wishes with a blue
Songbird on his shoulder 
Who keeps singing over everything

Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me

I picked up the song and found my picture 
In the paper

People from a time when he was
Everything he's supposed to be?""

Elliott Smith,"I never really had a problem because of leaving
But everything reminds me of her this evening

So if I seem a little out of it
Sorry
But why should I lie
Everything reminds me of her

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon all the time now from you people
Why are you staring into outer space crying
Just because you came across it and lost it

Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her",Everything Reminds Me of Her,2000
Elliott Smith,"Activity's killing the actor
And a cop's standing out in the road 
Turning traffic away
There was nothing she could do until after
When his body'd been buried below
Way back in the day

Oh my, nothing else could've been done
He made his life a lie
So he might never have to know anyone
Made his life the lie you know

I told him he shouldn't upset her
And that he'd only be making it worse
Involving somebody else
But I knew that he'd never forget her
While her memory worked in reverse
To keep her safe from herself

And oh my, nothing else could've been done
She made her life a lie 
So she might never have to know anyone
Made her life the lie you know

What I used to be will pass away and then you'll see

Wish I could call you today, just to hear a voice

It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away

A lot of hours to occupy, it was easy when I didn't know you yet 
Things I have to forget
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on and getting upset

Maybe IÂ got a problem, but that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing.
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away.

Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face

Writing in the glow of the tv static 
Taking out the trash to the man 
Give the people something they understand 

Stick man flashing a fine-line smile
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style
Rich man in a poor man's clothes 
The permanent installment of the daily dose 

And you tell off when you tell it like it is
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
Checking into a small reality
Boring as a drug you take too regularly 

The apple needs to laugh; the broken crutch 
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch 
Brought down like an old hotel 
People digging through the rubble for things they can resell 

""Happy holidays,"" said sick savior 
The leading love I still favor

I don't need a remedy

Elliott Smith,"The big problem is the main attraction
Dominoes are falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
Whiskey works better than beer

The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
And nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal - if you hang around
You're going to get wet

I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head

Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in beverly hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity

And I get my check from the trash treasury
'Cause I took my own insides out
It don't matter 'cause I had no sex life
All I want to do now is inject my ex wife

I've seen the movie and I know what happens
It's a Christmas time
And the needles on the tree

And I only understand every other word
""Open your parachute and grab your gun

Where no-one else gonna give me grief
Mess me around
Just make it over

Your opinion was the law of the land
A single thing that I couldn't always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day
Don't keep me around

Situations that I passed up for this

I'll go down and stay down
Sleep the rest of the day
Dreaming music to calm down

And stay down and keep evil away
I can see you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream

As a new one appears
To take you along where you've never been
The moonlight tonight seems to belong to me
'Cause I never go to sleep
I keep it company

One hit wouldn't matter a bit I'll
Stay down and think
What's here to find

And send you back to bed

Isolation pulled you past a tunnel to a bright 
World where you can make a place to stay

But everybody's scared of this place

His voice patrols the pier
From a mountain of cliche
That advances every day

It's all written on my chart
That I take what's given me
Most cooperatively

I do what people say
And lie in bed all day

It's forty-five past two
I almost forgot to show
Got a date to make with Mr. So-and-So
After which
I won't care when you all start to bitch and moan 
About being alone

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

Well, can't you just leave me alone?
You've already thrown all the sticks and stones 
You had to send my way
Well, can't you just leave it at that?
And spare us both the bother 
Because I just bounce back anyway
I got nothing that I want to do more 
Than make another sonic ""fuck you"" to play
Whenever you make my life cliche
So to fit in some little box with the all the labeled shit
You would say to keep confusion away

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder

Elliott Smith,"I'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
And the cold pain behind my eyes
It shoots back through my head
With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
But it's all right
'Cause some enchanted night I'll be with you

The tarot cards
And the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong
But they're untrue

I got plans for both of us
That involve a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine
That you left lying around
I can't hold my liquor but
I keep a good attitude
'Cause it's all right
Some enchanted night I'll be with you

And though you'd rather see me gone
Than to see there come the day
I'll be waiting for you anyway

Next door the TV's flashing
Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy from the 70s
With a lead no one recalls
He vanished into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I cry to see when you talked to me
The day you said we were through

But it's all right
Some enchanted night I'll be with you",Miss Misery [Early Version],2007
Elliott Smith,"The ghost of your smile is always looking for new 
Bodies to haunt 
And its been here 
And disappeared
Its hanging around aloofly for awhile
Gradually gone
Its pleasing
And freezing

Well I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
You looked all over town
Got turned around
To walk back through the mud
The kind you had left behind you

Everybody is the same in this long no-win game 
Where every new blood gets time to 
Become resigned

Now I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master

You just blow through the coals 
Blow through the coals
Blow through the coals 
Till everyone knows 
That your smile is just a ghost
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
Its old news 
You see that its no use
Waiting to start 
Waiting to light
Waiting till dark
I told you man 
I told you
Well I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master",New Disaster,2007
Elliott Smith,"Here come the sidewalk boss again
Telling me how I can't cave in
That I'm a study in black
Need a pat on the back
I look up and smile
A picture of dissatisfaction
That he can only see as a junkie
Though I might be straight as an arrow
He's busy shaking hands with my monkey
Busy shaking hands with my monkey well I go in the car
Straight to the bar
Where my sweetie pours the beer
For the millions of fans ignoring the bands
He's in my ear
Wants me to live in denial
Says you've gotta settle for something
Though it might not be really living
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste.

Look at the lengths you'll go to hide
You're under the veil
Pretending to fail
Gotta whole lot of empty time left to go
Now you've gotta fill it with something
I know what you can do don't you know
Anything is better than nothing.

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste

I'm here with my cup
Afraid to look up
This is how I spend my time

The biggest loser on sixteenth street
The invisible man with the see-through mind

With a wound to the head
Calling out to pretty Mary K

Here's what you get for things that haven't happened yet

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so

Saw the one big problem you keep under your hat
And its pretty unlikely that anyone else is cool with that

Who snaps my control

Such a funny thing but every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music

Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turn me into your slave
Come and do anything with me that you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you

Am I insane or do I really see
Heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies

How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear

Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why you stop to think
About this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again

So baby, won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make you strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane

Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery?

Oh pretty baby, you make me feel so good now
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a loving state of mind

Would you come home?

I've sung a lot of songs
And I made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But, darlin', can't you see
There's no one more important to me?
Baby, can't you see through me?
'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love, withholding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember, remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
Said, I love you for my life
You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over

Elliott Yamin,"Girl, when you do what you do to me
Everything is the way it should be
You make me feel like I'm living a dream

Tell me it's real
'Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away

Girl, I've been waiting for you all my life
I see my soul when I look in your eyes
You've taken me completely by surprise

Tell me it's real
'Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away (yes, you do)
I'm speaking truths
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away (yes, you do)

You don't have to promise me forever
All I'm asking you is for tonight
You need to take some time and see where this is going
Girl, it feels so right when we hold each other tight

Woo hoo hoo

Oh yeah

Tell me it's real
'Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away
Honest, you do
You take my breath away
I'm speaking truths

Elliott Yamin,"Mmmhmm
Oh yeah, yeah
Mmm
We're heading for a train wreck

I gotta be honest with you, baby
I knew it right from the start
Without knowing the cost to my soul
I paid for it with my heart
They say to be careful what you wish
What you want, and what you need
Second thoughts have got me thinking over
Maybe we're in too deep

And I'm so helpless
What's the point of building up just to tear it all down?
And I should care less
But you know I just can't
I can't help wanting you around

[Chorus]
Whatever we do
Better think it through
'Cause we're moving too fast
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
When it feels this good
Gotta hurt so bad
This just can't last
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck

And we're getting to the point of no return
'Cause, baby, when I give my heart
There ain't no turning back
No, it ain't
And I will live through a lesser turn
So, I just can't sit around
Waiting for the love to burn

[Chorus]

I gotta be honest with you, baby
I knew it right from the start
I guess all I knew

Elliott Yamin,"I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone

Girl, you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they
Keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away
(When) everything stays the same?
I just can't do it, baby

What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

You say that every man is lookin' for just one thing
You say they love you but they really don't know what it means
How can you think that way when you know nothin' about me
I say you runnin' away
I'll buy you nice things that I cannot pronounce
And if you let me love you, babe I will turn you on
I'll stay committed and I promise I would be around

If you try
It's not a waste of time
You will find
That love is what you need in your life
Just let it go
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Don't say no
Tell me what I need to do
To make you see that you don't have to be that way
Just don't be afraid!

Wooo
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

Elliott Yamin,"I'm ecstatic, I feel the magic, It's everlasting
I think that you were meant to be alive on this very night
With me, I see, it clearly
The dream you hear about
And never truly think it's realistic till it blows your mind
I never thought I could understand
I was searching me
And now I finally see

I see that some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

You're the reason, the air I'm breathing, so don't go leaving,
Cause loving you is the only thing that ever really touched my soul
I'm protective, of my blessings
Glad I kept it, I never really thought about the future till I saw my life
Finding it's purpose, so very worth it
And now I know that love is really worth it

And that's why some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

It's hard to be, and good to keep
And once you're with it, it's hard to leave
You can't help but run wild with imagination
It'll change your life from wrong or right
And then you touch, touch the sky, and now I
Don't see how I made it through the night
But I see how there's some people who fight

Some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

Some people fight for love,
(I don't wanna do it no more)
Some people hide from love,
(It just feels so good)
But when you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up cause you know that,

Going around in my head
And so many reasons that just
Don't' make sense

Do you with me when I loose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do

I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you

Still carry the memory of you

Go yet

The man that I am
I know you'd want me
To go on ahead
And I give it all just to see you again.

Ain't nobody quite like you

Girl, I think I always knew
Ohh, I just can't confront the truth
Ohh, yaa

You make me feel like I'm gonna lose it
You make me feel like I'm gonna lose it
You make me feel like I'm gonna lose all of my self control
Well, alright",Self Control,2011
Elliott Yamin,"You're staring into the sky watching the planes fly by
It's been too long since I seen your face on
Thinking about you very 
You make my heart in so many ways

Sweet baby
Your body is so mine, is something I got
Is such an amazing way to lose

Oh, oh, oh, all I ever think about is you

Elliott Yamin,"Woke up this morning
Needed to talk
Pick up the phone and started to call
That's when It hit me that you were gone

So many questions
Things that's been said
So much confusion
Go 'round in my head
And so may reasons that just don't make sense

I try
To carry on but something's missing inside
I just wanna know if you were above me
Show me some kind a sign
Do you still hear me
When I call your name?
Will you be with me when I lose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do
You always told me that you'd never go
I need u to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you
Show me you do

How do I start to
Make sense what's left
Still carry a memory of you in my head
And I'm just not ready to let you go yet
Oo no
But I know you're proud of
The way that I am
That you would want me to go on ahead
I give it all off see you again

I try
To carry on but something's missing inside
I just need to know if you were above me
Show me some kind a sign
Do you still hear me
When I call your name?
Will you be with me when I lose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do
You always told me that you'd never go
I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you
Show me you do","Up, Down, All Around",2011
Elliott Yamin,"Every story has an ending
Ours is just the same
We can't run away
Where's the glory in holding onto something
We can't change
Ooh
Where's the distance between the things you say
And what you do
Let's just tell the truth
And the resistance
Pretending that our love is bulletproof
When it's all over
Say it's all over
You pulled me in and shut me out
But that's no way to say you need me
You lift me up and let me down
Apologize and say you love me
We need more than 3 words to take us backwards
It's almost like we're tryna find another way to say it's over
To say it's over

Do you remember the mystery in how it used to be
Or is that just me
Ohh
The feeling lingers
But never long enough to make me believe
That it's not over
It's really over

You pulled me in and shut me out
But that's no way to say you need me
You lift me up and let me down
Apologize and say you love me
We need more than 3 words to take us backwards
It's almost like we're tryna find another way to say it's over
To say it's over

Tonight we'll see the last of us
The final scene
Tonight
Tonight

You pulled me in and shut me out
But that's no way to say you need me
You lift me up and let me down
Apologize and say you love me
We need more than 3 words to take us backwards
It's almost like we're tryna find another way to say it's over

To say it's over
To say it's over
To say it's over

Every story has an ending
Ours is just the same",Virginia,2011
"Elliott, Eugenia","I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1999
"Elliott, Eugenia","Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
(Him, with her humming along)
That all I longed for long ago

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),1999
"Elliott, Eugenia","Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,1999
