Gwen Stefani,"It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

Yeah, I know we're cool

And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

C-cool
Ah ah I know we're cool
I know we're cool
C-cool yeah I know we're cool
Me and you are cool",Cool [Album Version],2008
Gwen Stefani,"What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by?
Now it's only me

Tick tock

Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
Scary conversations
Shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a cloner?

Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh oh oh

What you waiting for?

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?

Tick tock
Take a chance, you stupid ho

Like a new cut pattern, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place?
Born to blossom, bloom to perish

You know you're only known
'Cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable (uh huh)
Oh oh oh

Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female!
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?

I can't wait to go
Back into Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style

Go!
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

Gwen Stefani,"Always running from what feels right
Too fast, and I didn't know
Then a minute toss the daylight
You're here, no way to let go

Don't look back, when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be
One day we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms

We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

I got something and it feels right
What I need it to be
You control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made

Don't look back, when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be
One day we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms

You won't regret it, no

One more ""No"" and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

Let's forget who we are and who we know
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby we can escape, run away with me

You like the way that I dress (you love the way that I see)
You love the things that I do (yes but I love that you are free)
You love the way I think (for people everywhere)

Run away, yes do the day with me

Gwen Stefani,"Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
Fuck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

(They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over)

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain’t the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die",Kings Never Die,2015
Gwen Stefani,"Never thought this would happen
I let it sink in, you're gone
I don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

I don't know why I cry

Gwen Stefani,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told
And some choose to believe it
And I know they're wrong, wait and see
Some day we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

And who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
And omebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see
And someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep?
And have you heard voices?
And I've heard them calling my name
This is the sweet sound
That called the young sailors?
The voice might be one in the same

And I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time

Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

Gwen Verdon,"Tonight at eight, you shoulda seen
A chauffeur pull up in a rented limousine
My neighbors burned, they like to die
When I tell them who is gettin' in and goin' out is I

If they could see me now, that little gang of mine
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top drawer, first rate chums I attract
All I can say is, ""Wow-ee"", looka where I am
Tonight, I landed, pow, right in a pot of jam

What a set up, holy cow, they'd never believe it
If my friends could see me now, if they could see me now

My little dusty group, traipsin' 'round this million dollar chicken coop
I'd hear those thrift shop cats say, ""Brother, get her
Draped on a bed spread made from three kinds of fur""
All I can say is, ""Wow, wait till the riff an' raff
See just exactly how he sign this autograph""

What a build up, holy cow, they'd never believe it
If my friends could see me now, if they could see me now

Alone with Mister V., who's waiting on me like he was a maitre d'
I'd hear my buddies saying, ""Crazy, what gives?
Tonight she's living like the other half lives""
To think the highest brow, which I must say is he
Should pick the lowest brow, which there's no doubt is me

What a step up, holy cow, they'd never believe it,
If my friends could see me now
What a step up, holy cow, they'd never believe it
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now
Hi girls, it's me, Charity

Gwen Verdon,"When I'm so jittery my knees buckle, ice water tickles my spine
I'm trapped like a butterfly in a net then I say to myself
I'm the bravest individual, I have ever met
I'm the bravest individual, I have ever met

This game makes very good sense, I get results isn't that great
Get back my confidence
And then even pulse seventy-eight
So, when I panic and feel each day

I come to the end of the line then I say that fear hasn't licked me yet
I keep telling myself I'm the bravest individual I have ever met
Funny, but suddenly I can't swallow I think I'm going to die
Sometimes, if you pardon the word, I sweat!

Then you say to yourself
I'm the bravest individual I have ever met
I'm the bravest individual I have ever met
Good, Your game makes very good sense
I get results, isn't that fine?

Got back my confidence and then
Even pulse a hundred and nine
So when you panic and think each day
You fail at whatever you try

I just say that fear hasn't licked me yet
And keep telling yourself I'm the strongest, soundest stoica
Daringest man, who's most heroical
I'm the bravest individual I have ever met!

Everywhere jazz, everywhere booze
Everywhere life, everywhere joy

You can like the life you're livin'
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's good

Isn't it grand? Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell? Isn't it fun?

Ladies and gentlemen, the Vickers theater
Chicago's finest finest home of family entertainment
Is proud to announce a first
The first time, anywhere there has been an act of this nature
Not only one little lady but two!
You've read about them in the papers
And now here they are a double header!
Chicago's own killer, drillers those two scintillating sinners

Gwen Verdon,"I always wanted my name in the papers
Before Aremus, I used to date this well to do ugly bootlegger
He used to like to take me out and show me off
Ugly guys like to do that

Once it said in the paper
""Gangland's Al Capelli
Seen with cute red-headed Corenne""
That was me, I clipped it out and saved it

Look I'm gonna tell you the truth
Not that the truth really matters
But I'm gonna tell you anyway

The thing is see, I'm older than I ever intended to be
And all my life I wanted to be a dancer
In Vaudeville, ooh yeah
Have my own act, but no, no, no
They always turned me down

It was one big world full of no, life
Then Amus came along, sweet, safe, Amus who never says no
You know, some guys are like mirrors
And when I catch myself in Amus's face
I'm always a kid, you could love a guy like that

Look now I gotta tell you
Now I hope this ain't too crude
In the bed department, Amus was zero
I mean when we went to bed
He made love to me like he was
Fixing a carburetor or something
I love ya, honey I love ya

Anyway to make a long story short
I started fooling around
Then I started screwing around
Which is fooling around without dinner

I gave up the Vaudeville idea
Because well, after all those years
He sorta figured opportunities just passed you by
Ooh, it ain't, oh, no, no, no, no, babe, it ain't
If this film guy gets me off
And with all this publicity, now I got me a world full of yes

The name on everybody's lips is gonna be Roxie
The Lady raking in the chips is gonna be Roxie
I'm gonna be a celebrity that means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be Roxie
Who says that murder's not an art
And who in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang
Roxie heart

I gotta get me some boys
I'm gonna get me a whole bunch of boys
They're gonna wait outside in line to get to see Roxie
Think of those autographs outside, good luck to you, Roxie
And I'll appear in a Lavaliere that goes all the way down to my waist
Here a ring, there a ring, everywhere a ring-a-ling
But always in the best of taste

I'm a star and they love me and I love them
And they love me for loving them
And I love them for loving me and we love each other
That's because none of us got enough love in our childhood
And that's showbiz, kid

Gwyneth Paltrow,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

Charley boy died in my arms, he saw Jesus, I saw blood
It soaked her wallet picture that cold night

At noon that silver bell would ring

We always ate together in those days

One by one those kids went off and found a love of their own

That we'd have separate rooms side by side,

So I'm lyin' in this single bed until they cut the lights,
That's when she'll sneak in and I'll be fine

Words: Gyle Waddy				Music: Kana Bukuru Lesouple

Everyone, everywhere
I've been thinkin' a lot about
mankind and I have doubts.
I'm afraid things aren't going that good.
Seems to me 
that this world is turning wrongly.
Thanks to man for his modern technology, 
to science advancements for everything 
that help us live easily;
help us live very com'tably,
but there's a question that that I ask myself, 
'Why so much ignorance, insolence  
turned against them who have less chance?'
When we see people bleeding, suffering, dying
why can't we help them without demanding 
that they give something in return? 
Why not give peace to all mankind?
I hear a mother's sigh, baby's cry, 
hungry eyes that are full of flies.
Child warriors taught by men:
Little girls that are sold they're innocent.
Such a crime. Now's the time! 
Stop these horrors let's clean those ignorant minds.
Stand against inhumanity!
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's have peace!
Come on!  For mankind!
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Kana:
It's our lives. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's make peace the bottom line
There's no choice. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
It's your life! Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Parlando: Gyle
We have to stop all these atrocities 
that are going on in the world. 
There's too much pain, too much hurt, 
come on let's put our hands together. 
Let's stop the war. Let's help those kids 
who need help. All those people out there 
want the same thing as you do, as I do. 
We have to keep on going. 
We have to keep our faith strong. 
You see without humanity there's nothing. 
We are the chosen people. We have to do it. 
If we don't do it what's going to happen? 
Let's give peace to mankind. 
Let's put our hands together. Let's hold each. 
I think it's time to do that right now. 
Come on put your hands together. Hold each other. 
Come on it's now, I would say it's now or never. 
Peace, peace to mankind. Come on! 
Have peace! Peace to mankind.

The art of make-believe
The treasure behind closed doors
The hunter behind the trees

The smell of sweet perfume

Gym Class Heroes,"I took cutie for a ride in my death cab
She tipped me with a kiss I dropped her off at the meth lab
Before she left she made a dashboard confessional 
And spilled her guts in cursive but what's worse is
I could still see her bright eyes like sunny day real estate
Oh my and in a funny way it irritates 
So high but no chance

My little chemical romance left a bad taste in my mouth
But I approached her like hey Mercedes why the long face
Why you crying? there's no need
Just throw on this coheed and fall out boy meets girl jimmy eat world
But Schlep eats pills till he's all out
Not once not twice she was thrice times a lady
Actin' all brand new, but I had to
Bounce over to the postal services to

Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
And on the way I saw planes and mistook'em for stars 
She played games but she took em too far
At the drive in

Watching soft porn and you could tell
By the trail of the dead, that there was something in the popcorn
Hopped back in my cab destination midtown 
Just to get up with some kids that like to get down
I made my rounds and that was that

In between the frowns, the scraps and heart attacks
And I remember I seen her ass in early November
On a Thursday taking back Sunday for a refund
She shot a wink like no hard feelings
Then she jetted to Brazil man them pills had me spun

This is the story of the year right here
This is hot water music
Put ya ramen into it",Taxi Driver,2004
Gym Class Heroes,"(Chorus)
She says she loves me 
but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts
it's like another papercut
and now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
claims she loves me
but she cuts me into pieces
when I'm sewed up
here comes another papercut
now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them cailing fan blades.....

we met 22 years back
fresh out the womb
now she consumes me, 
no room for self these days
and she's so demanding
do this, do that
don't forget to take your medicine
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
the welcome mat reads ""please take off your shoes""
but she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs to 
satisfy her needs
but I'm fed up 
with plugging cuts everytime they bleed
so I dip my pen in the puddle
what a bloody mess its been 
trying to end this struggle
but I love her, 
she's the reson for the lesions
man I love her
I start bleeding when she's leaving
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of 
all the lessons learned
on my missions to try to find her but 
I'll sit alone until she comes back home
and I'll be waiting by the phone

(phone rings:  ""Hello?"")

(On the Phone)
She don't live here no more
I heard she's staying down the street with two dead beat 
that don't treat her right with two bad ass kids
Guilt and Regret
and I'm willing to bet 
my last album (that?) she's wishing she was kissing me

Man the nerve of this bitch
pardon my French
but it's been 10 days
and I'm getting kind of light headed
maybe I'll write her a letter in a gentleman's way
and send it with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
but all I think about is
when she's here and holding me 
I love her
She's the reason for the lesions
man I love her
I start bleeding when she's leaving
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of 
all the lessons learned
all my missions trying to find her and
I can't complain
I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name
she just lives in my brain

This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But, mama, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a choke hold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat, my white flag is wavin'

I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

She even got her very own ring tone
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

Gym Class Heroes,"You think you know, but you have no idea
This is the diary of a raging onomatopoeia

Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together
I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
God's placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
Well thank ya fella,
how considerate
I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates
Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly and
Flash a devilish grin
That'll make the most masculine Men skeptical of his existence
And when the rain begins, I'll take a seat to retire and admire the spectacle
from a distance
For instance, there was this cat the other day shootin me ice grills
But when I looked, he'd look the other way
Now any other day
I wouldn't let this type of shit bother me
Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
So finally I stepped to him
Kindly disrespected him
Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it affected him
He broke down in tears talkin bout how God neglected him Hook.

Make this rain go away
Things would be much better
I swear, I swear
If the sun would come out today
Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile, worthwhile

And all it took was a sewing needle to deflate my swollen ego
Then pop pop went my God Complex
I never thought 19 yrs after my first breath I'd be in art school surrounded by corny fucks debating who's more depressed
I'm 22 now, and still can't deal with what's real
But I'll be damned if I give up and settle for pills
Shit, my Daddy taught me better
Mommy taught me how to crack 40's and jack 6 packs in oversized sweaters
Over time went the changes
So I'm in the rain waiting
For the flood gates to open
Impersonating my favorite VH1 Behind the Music tragedy
Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
I'm PH balanced
For the floor but strong enough to stay afloat
And doggy paddle long enough to catch that life preserver rope
And then I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like, ""Damn, my man for the love of Pete what happened""

And finally I'll step to you
Kindly disrespect you
Look you dead in the eyes and analyze how it effects you
Watch you break down in tears talkin about how God neglected you Hook.

Make this rain go away
Things would be much better
I swear, I swear
If the sun would come out today
Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile, worthwhile

she caught my eye the very second that she passed me
I kissed her once
then she started to harass me
she called all night long
I had to buy a brand new phone

there was Melanie

she had a twin sister, Teresa
I bumped into them at Cam's gettin pizza
the greatest night of my life
schleps to rock that kill to birds

and there was Erica
she had the stankest breath in North America,
I tryed to slip her tic tacs
but they were scared of her
and when we made out
I always had to plug my nose

And I suppose your know the sister
shoot, I swear by hand and God
I only kissed her

I hate to bring her up again
I didn't want her

yea the poster girl for Paxil

she used to sniff like a fist full
one time she chased me down the street with a pistol
she tried to say I took her stash
she bugged out and tried to kill my ass

and at last we got Kimmy
she went abroad
came back
and broke up with me
and so I ripped up all the letters that she sent me

I could have written 9 verses just in time for the show
Slacker mind state living on time that's borrowed
My motto's ""I'll stop procrastinating tomorrow""
I said the sorrow from the wind chimes left happiness
Lonesome and strung sarcasm to make the melody wholesome
From my lungs to my feet 
I'm breathing everything I speak
But now they're charging for oxygen
And the bills are next week
I'll be a day late and a buck short
Story of my life
I wish my pay rate was much more
Ducking swords in a rat race I didn't apply for
Running swords 
Something that's fake and thinking
Why for?
They're shutting doors right in my face 
And sit in high horses 
Is car and a dope place 
Something to die for this is my war

Simple living is a bitch
But damn, I do it well

I always bail

Solidified career option
A hop skip and a leap 
Away from a rock star 
And not too far away from filling my pops shoes
The idyllic hard working? 
With callused hands
Complete with wife, kids, dog, house, and picket fence
That's non sense, I'm conviced
I'm built for better things 
And won't settle for the empty smile that cheddar brings
It seems like I'm working hard 
Simply cause it's what they say that's what I have to do
You graduate and then you either get a job or you go to school
12 years wasn't enough?
That's more than half of my life spent 
Trying to make the world accept me
Plus I've fought the papers saying that I made it through
Now I'm working two jobs, three with music
And you don't respect me?

or for the cash
that's your decision x5
it's like I'm torn between two worlds
a paintbrush and a microphone
a canvas or a beat
CD or mp
anything goes when ink pen flows
and God only knows where its gonna bring me next
so I'm inclined to like paint rhymes
and spit kaleidoscope with one eye closed
and I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
you know the cycle
asshole don't front it,
it goes inspiration then productivity
then a sense of self worth
and in steps depression
like back and forth
and forth and back
should I paint a picture of record a track?
????????
and I don't know
I'm still undecided
but over the years I've found clever way to hide it
and those that lack the passion I have, may despise it
but my mamma made me this way,
I thank her everyday,
so tell the kids to keep coloring outside the lines
until they loose their limitations
and their minds are free
the teachers that you want your money this time
and tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
and my mamma that her baby boy is doing just fine
although he's running out of patients
but his mind is free 
and tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
and that his son is two steps away from where he need to be",To Bob Ross With Love,2005

Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music?
Well this is your big chance.
You see, music is much like a brochetted butterfly,
With a shadowy promenade of effervescence,
Yet slows down the bottom of misty mountains of darkness.
Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror.
God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome?
It is a manifestation of love.
It a forest of emptiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it.
So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free.
Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul thieves.
Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners.
But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back.
And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not.
Ladies and Gentlemen I give you ""The Papercut Chronicles""",Za Intro,2005

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been awhile since we talked last and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love it when she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song
But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

Gym Class Heroes,"My life's these yellow lines, concrete, and parliament butts
Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks
Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day
Hangovers, hangups, dial backs, running make up, apologies and promises
And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad
But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have
I'm putting miles on my body; 'bout due for a tune up in this gas station
Food ain't really helping, but I'm loving every minute
Every road sign's a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with

[Chorus]
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in seven weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

I like these hotels, passports, random bag checks
Day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet
Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame
Same clothes, seven days, whew; damn, I need to change
And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend
Wildin' out on a level Nic Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here)
We made a lot of friends and even more enemies
Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be
Soft raving baby, life's lovely
Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me
The girl's textin' me, talkin' about gettin' all cuddly
'Cause you paint a pretty picture, but the frame is so ugly

And now it's back in a van with four of my mans
Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands
I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man
From killa California to the shores of Japan
Good times stayin' up late in Austin
Coast to coast V8 to Chicago
To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston
And smokin' that most great eight in Colorado
Home ain't home no more
I hug the road and kiss the concrete, and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat
No matter where we go or where we at
We carry upstate on our back; it's like that

I'll be sure to leave the scene you started staging

And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine

I heard you bought a crib on biters block

The poster boy for Xerox and a role model for parasites
You serve no purpose, you're purely decorative
And bore us to death with your auditory sedatives
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night

My man Tom introduced us, but I was too shy to say 'hi'
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend, I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited two weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly, it only made me want you more
Week four rolled around, and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knocked me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same, tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin' you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moments
And now I'm emailing my love a dozen digital roses

I even wrote a song about, like to hear it? Here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)
But it's hard for me to not hate
When I'm on myspace, I never see my face in your 'top eight'
Approaching six weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter; this is not a 'LOL' matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces, and I split them down the middle
I could swing back and forth for three days (rephrase)
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and I-chat
Besides, I hit you all the time, and you never write back
I stay on my feet (shit)
And be persistent till my name is under 'who you'd like to meet'

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name?
All I know is that I'm smittin' with your pictures, wishin' you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up; it's all nonsense
Lately I've been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something
I check my in-box ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doin' something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So, yeah, it's time to sign out; my vision's getting blurry

(Ah) I was just a snotty-nosed degenerate
With hit pass perfection
Dodgin' teachers down to give my late ass detention
Hardly a heartthrob but I made due
Using those same 'circle yes or no'
Notes I used in grade school
Folded love letters with a tab that read 'pull here'
Writin' back and forth in notebooks for a full year
I used to daydream about Ms. Magnus
The type of fantasies you feel guilty for having
But who hasn't?
The only difference beside the age
Was the fact I acted on it
And who wouldn't?
A schoolboy crush met mature woman lust
And they hit it off so well
And I could tell the day she asked me
To stay after class that it was all bad
But I just bit my lip and acted all mad
The bell rang, class dismissed
The door shut and her skirt went up (That's a fact!)

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room (legendary, baby!)

We gave a brand new meaning
To 'after-school special'
The second that our lips touched
She kissed my ribs
And counted each one out loud
I tried my hardest not to giggle
But I couldn't 'cause it tickled so much
She pulled my pants to half-mast
I said, 'hurry, Miss Sin
You gonna make me late for math class.'
The way she praised my balls was vicious
Now that's what I like to call sacrilegious
One time became twenty times
Before we knew it
We stopped caring about where we would do it
From the classroom to the bathroom
And when all the students was gone
We'd even do it in the staff room
From F's to A's in less than three days
Now the underachiever's the one with the best grades
Made the third floor shake without breakin' a sweat
Goddamn, it felt good to be the teacher's pet

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room (legendary, baby!)

(Ah) Goodness gracious, accusations
Started flyin' through the building
Cruel as school children
This isn't how it was supposed to be
Reminiscing don't stand so close to me
And if it's mostly my fault for letting this shit happen
But I couldn't resist a little adolescent bragging
I mean, after all I was only fifteen
And she was showing me things
My virgin eyes had never seen
Never forget the little meeting she called
But when she saw my reaction
It made her appalled
So basically what you're sayin' is
If I don't keep tappin' that ass
Then you ain't gonna let me pass
Psh, some punishment, lady
And as I turned towards the door
I looked back
She had her clothes on the floor
Needless to say I passed with flying colors
But my teacher was my best friend's mother (damn)

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch

Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school

Almost twenty years after the fact I'm still on my hustle

Somebody asked me one time

You look high
Shit, yeah, I'm high

Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links

We'll do whatever you want to

Put your nose to the speaker

Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

Gym Class Heroes,"I remember when I first laid eyes on you 
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve drop a line
You made it clear you weren't just another myspace mistress 
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send 
Waited two weeks for a response and got nothing 
Honestly it only made me want you more
Week four rolled around and I was this close to letting go 
Something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you 
It was plain to see we were meant lock lips you
Knocked with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking 
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said the you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game 
They're all the same trying to get your instant messenger name 
But the fact you hit me back made me smile 
You must saw something you liked when you were skimming through my profile 
You caught me the most pivotal moment 
So I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses

Click Approve!! Gimme some kind of sign to let me know its time to make my move
Click Approve!! Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Click Approve!! Gimme some kind of sign to let me know its time to make my move
Click Approve!! Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Lets face it; it's a sad situation when we have to
Resort to keyboards as a means of making relations 
But I don't have the patience I get straight to the point
So this me at my most honest 
No ego 
No gym class status 
Just Travis 
Love it or leave it but you gotta admit 
On scale of 1 to awesome I'm the shit 
Just get over it an add me goddamit I've been waiting too long
Even wrote a song about like to hear it here it go 
If I'm being to annoying let me know 
But it's hard for me to not hate when imp on myspace 
And I never my face in your top 8
Approaching six weeks now 
Its kind of obvious that you're either occupied or playing games 
All my moneys on the latter 
This is not a LOL matter 
Why would you pass?
Up a chance this great 
If there was two forces 
And I split'em down the middle
I could swing back and forth for 3 days rephrase 
If I had 2 horses and I beat me with authority 
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face 
But all I got is powerbook and ichat
Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back 
But I stay on my feet and am persistent 
Till names under who you'd like to meet...

Click Approve!! Gimme some kind of sign to let me know its time to make my move
Click Approve!! Baby girl I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Click Approve!! Gimme some kind of sign to let me know its time to make my move
Click Approve!! Come on girl baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
	
Who cares if we don't know each other's last name? 
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishing you would feel the same 
I admit I get a little jealous
When other dudes leave comments 
Don't let it gas you up its all nonsense 
Lately I've been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this
Mansion I bought 
But it's all wishful thinking 
Just gimme some kind of sign to let me know I'm freakin' you

And if you love what I'm speaking about 
Say something I checked my inbox 10 
And ain't nothing your probably busy doing something sexy 
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time login 
And not if not ain't no love lost, between you and me, 
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be,

Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend

But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise

And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song

But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word

And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like you

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a choke-hold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)

Not much of a girlfriend

It's been awhile since we talked last 
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song 
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love it when she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure

She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man I swear)
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here

Transformers, Ninja Turtles, Hungry Hippos

You put it back in the air, when the wee's (whistle) gone
Reminiscing bout when we were young, but now we've grown

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam

Come on ya'll
Let's talk about the scene for a minute
I know we ain't been seen in a minute
We left it for a minute now we all up in it

Baby boy if you've got them big dreams go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans, I wont fit it
When I see those scene girls, bet they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean

Now a lot of ya'll won't get it
Now it's mean but I don't give a damn if ya'll don't get it
So fresh and so clean in my new jean
While I'm laughing at the bacon, you're all crying a the clinic

I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I've got my own to whirl, gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to dribble
Make your moves in that black hatch back Honda Civic

Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it
But I can't so let's go on, give the hook a revisit

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam

With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

Maybe I'm wrong
But after twenty six years I feel I've payed my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose

And now I stand here proudly in L.A.
At a sold out crowd
And when no one's around
I refuse, to be as inferior to you

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned

A fool to cool to maintain 2 dames

That's just stupid, this whole situation's bogus

Tell you what do it better

I just might
Take it back to 86
You wanna lick, sike!

Don't let the TV mislead you
Me and you dude we are not equal
F*** you this is for my people
F*** you this is for my people

Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must've been trans
And so see through
F*** you this is for my people
F*** you this is for my people

[Chorus: x 4]
Put up your peace sign, put your index down

Before I utter words
And before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear
I'm about securing the wind

I puzzle up my words
While I piece another concoction
'Cause I'm stubborn with the thought
That failure was never an option

I grinds like a carpenter
Until my caleceous's bleed
With the pa**ion from my heart
To the many mouths that I feed

That's why I look at most of you
Stupid I know it's odd
Because you can't really do
Nothin' to me unless you GOD

But bein' that none of you ain't him
You can't f*** with me
Now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined

I'm walkin' through the heap of gauntlets
While the fire is burnin''
Or how the tires
Turning on the rim of the V

I laugh and shake it off
The s*** they be doin' to me
Wit all the yappin' and talking
And so and so think

That you can ever stop the kid
Oh no

So if you get in my way you know yer done son
You best believe what I say you better run son
F*** you because I do this for my loved ones
F*** you because I do this for my loved ones

You better kneel down
And pray cause where I come from
We goin' hard everyday that's how the fights won
F*** you because I do this for my loved ones
F*** you because I do this for my loved ones

[Chorus: x 4]
Put up the peace sign, put the index down

Look mom no hands
Yer little boys a man
Everything you said is finally settin' in
Trainin' wheels fell off and I kept peddling

Now I'm ridin' wheelies on this industry
Say the word I'll ghost-ride
This b**** instantly
Good lookin' pop on the strength that you givin' me

Wasn't for you Gym Cla** would be history
I'm on my upstate s***
I Was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Gettin' brains from two dames with French accents

Now I mess with local chicks
I get em upstate s***
You prob thinking I'm wrong right?
Like I should quit writtin' these songs right?

Tell you what do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you want a lick, sike!

Now it's a lot of yall that can't stand me
'Cause my resemblance to prince is uncanny
But f*** you this is for my family
F*** you this is for my family

Upstate new york to Miami
Up late recording in my jammies
I do it for my family
F*** you this is for my family

And the be well
Quite honest with ya,
I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on Lee nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off trying to freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails

But I do it for the kids, life through the tower head on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in the corner like mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life till we're dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then just say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter

And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town

Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home

And when your bones can't take no more
Just remember what you're here for

Gym Class Heroes,"She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said ""No, Ma'am""
I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but the heat can turn water to wine
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna be just fine.

So there I stood six feet in sin, a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing question or am I another lost soul searching?
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told she'd pray for my children
I said ""If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?""

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet
I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say
I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I heard the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favourite brand?
And for that matter, is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts.

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

My first love was a chick from the sixth named Geneva
Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
My mama never liked her
My father didn't neither
After 22 years I got eager and had to leave her.
Now I'm realizing how much I really need her
But someone said follow my heart and head eastward
That's when I met Brooklyn, but Brooklyn was a cheater
The second I turned my back
Jay and Wheezy tag-teamed her
So I started packing, she asked me what happened
I told her I was leavin' her for her older sister Manhattan,
Manhattan was into rap so we started chit-chatting
And she was Chinese, Italian, black and porto-latin
Super high maintenance and way too into fashion
Didn't even tell the piecer left her number on a napkin
Damn, but back then was back then
Now I heard she went Hollywood and began acting

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh somebody take me home

Please take me home

And after Manhattan, I was acting silly
Messing with a stick-body jewel named Philly
But that didn't work out too great
I'm vegetarian and all she ate was cheesesteak
I went to Boston more for Mary Ann
And almost got married man
But she was self-centered always stuck in Maryland
I knew a slim thing named Virginia
I swear to god her body's smoking but she kept gettin' thinner
And I'll never forget my first trissie
In the pins with the Carolina twins gettin' busy
I know the history but I had to leave early
On the 85 doin' 80 Friday bright and early
And met a Georgia Peach named Annie
Who used to stay in Atlanta
Accent so thick I couldn't even understand her
And that's when I realized
I damn near ran through the whole I-95

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh somebody take me home

Please take me home

Yeah, then I met Miami, she was Spanish
Miami te amo, mi chiamo Travis
She could tell that I wasn't bilingual
I don't know pogito, but I know un poquito
We can hit south beach and drink mojitos
And maybe you can introduce me to your people
Ha, yo no voi pedra
You're my first love, keep on coming
You no voi payar
I think I finally found where I'mma stayin'
I-95 but never forget the 88

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh somebody take me home","Lazarus, Ze Gitan",2011

And keep on walking till I make my way home

Can someone tell me how I got here in the first place
'Cause honestly in my opinion this the worst place
I mean I even said hello to a few girls
I feel like Brad Pitt stuck in cool world
'Cause everything so foreign
And all the conversation is boring
I mean I'm practically snoring
Could somebody please show me the door man
'Cause I don't think that I can take it
Everybody here is desperate hit like Replacements
That's probably why I ain't sayin' shit
Oh what the hell I might as well get wasted

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Gypsy Hermanos,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",A  Mi Manera,2011
Gypsy Hombres,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Careful kid, this is not your song
Although it could be before too long

Before too long, a lesson learned
To stand downwind and watch it burn
To the lake, wash away any trace of yesterday

Had you ever thought of waking up?
Undercover, never letting up?

I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, separated
a nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
'cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
about some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal

Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze

Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop

Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC

Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected

Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed

But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me

One style that may have damaged me

And in my back yard there's a cemetery
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off peak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter
Thinking about trying me then reconsider
Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy

Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store

He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades

Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of

On a scale of one to ten I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death of only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Munroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello

Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin' her a great mass of physical pain

She said, ""Tit for tat, step off my bra strap.
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.""
Then I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut

The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, ""FTF is always there.""

Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday

[Chorus]

There has never been a dame in my entire life
My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex

Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they want to do, is knock their boots off

And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself

They break down, and they start to cry and said
""Oh! I don't believe this guy!""

[Chorus]
Now what are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""It's all about the finances"" ""Forget the romance""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""Guys with cash"" ""can rock my big a--""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

Silly girls on a strip, struttin' back and forth
Watchin' cars, thinkin' of G'n off
Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything

You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
When young, now take a look at what you've become

A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me

Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Oreida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat

Is that what you do for a living get paid?
Come on, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty

[Chorus]
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""He better buy me some gold bamboozles"" ""And some Fendi too""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of

First of all, don't leave home without it
Without what?
The gold card
I'm tryin' to tell you now

I don't lay on my back for free
You know as they say
If you want to Taney
Ya got's ta pay

Yo what's up gorgeous, what's your name?
Baby let's talk about your assets first
Alright baby, well let's go for a ride in my new car
What kind of car you drivin' baby?

I got a new Yugo
A Yugo? Come here
You go, get in your Yugo
And get on out of here!

Girlfriend, tell him about himself
I don't believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money
Bud Light money? A Yugo? A thirty-five hundred dollar car?
And you steppin' to this? I take only Benz's and better love

Forget about the love it's all about the money

Treat em like step-childs and smile
I grab the mic then I check one two
Brother's look, yo what he's gonna do
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C.

Cuz I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, cuz every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum
Gets the crowd prepared to hear some
Super, high-powered lyrics, specially chosen
The battle's a snowstorm and brothers are frozen

The Genius, is a rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't (Do me!)
Yo, I'm not the type of guy
Cuz my lyrics are high powered, meaning fly
I'm not barn, I'm building hard
You thought that I was weak, well let me speak
With me being frozen this MC weather come to
All linked together
See I got wreck, wrapping things in check
You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin', you couldn't handle
A style like mine, I dismantle
Just by pickin' up the mic, and start showin'
I cold turn it out, and yo then
I get super serious strong and then furious
Give an MC something to make them curious
On, professors, in college
I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin' up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches

See the December's Primateen mist coughin'

You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten word rhyme it took em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
Weak on his words and never thinkin' bout freeing
Positive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
Cuz on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
And collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To determine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, cuz I know how you feel
You lack words like mines, talent and skill
Now I'm known to flip a show

Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying 'cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties

That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin' at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin' the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
'Cuz if you do your brain is more hollow than

Space Oblivia, or The Abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs

But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a Genie
No hocus pocus 'cuz I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind

Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

And open Bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take

I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom

Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome

I prophesied to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin' evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness

Choose the ball, and you join your mother, in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose

So, come boy, choose life or death

The only man I hold wake for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in eighty-three, rocked Taylor's
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with rac-coons
Corner sittin wine niggaz sippin Apple Boone, this ain't no white cartoon
Cause I be duckin' crazy spades

Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept? Stand up
You're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Iron Man be sippin' rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' knives which stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine and great Henry the Eighth
Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don

I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented
This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues

It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized his crime and drug wars

Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough

There is no clips that's full enough

Restaurant's on a stake-out so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop like stacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Going Through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so

On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart

Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts

Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beat box
And microscopic optics received through the boxes

Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit

Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies

Joysticks a Sega, I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in ?, 2 fine tune it 
Ship enough units, emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask

And who the nigga you anoint?

Throwin bullets in the air to test wind
And which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall, that still flies all dies

It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin, breakin his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above, Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments
Of cell, inhale these venomous thoughs that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up, bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
You know what I'm sayin?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris.
We talk about sex, money and drugs.
(Ruled by power.) And why'all cats don't know
What it's about. (Love and power.)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV.
Killah Priest, come on.

[Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
Burnin desire, ebony eyes
Painted toe nails, legacys die
Drivin by the well, egyption queens, Arabian shieks
Are paid to knock off rich kings, for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows, who stabbed they husbands
Sleepin on silk pillows, blood on they robes
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods, pull out they gats
Like magic wands, castin spells, sendin niggaz to Hell
Trappin they souls in realms, baptize em with holy water
Springin on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers, a 1000 muslim bibles
For the cobler, hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dyin saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liqour

Ha, I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatenin the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin my chances of defeat by predeterminin the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my words shall be bombed, regardless to anything or anyone
I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was livin all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharoahs change to cattle
I'm able to subtract the devil's arrow
Singin at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels
Man made slaves and modern day babbles
Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We went to Gretal and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackel

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
Then flight with insight
Everything i thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred
A pair of brightness of exploding stars
Gave me goods to taste
No ingredients to traced
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war

The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd
The warm side crushed the barrier
The storm side destroyed your area

On a man-made lake, there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke aboat the average loss commission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet, and now a riot will form
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm
I swing, on you fake, radio personalities
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements 
The earth use, and built it to a complex
Network, of communications, you're up against a hopeless, situation
I screen every vehicle, through enemy observation
Swarmin' unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the force significantly, change the error
Check my wind pattern, it's headin' west
Success is freedom, failure could mean death
Humans sweat, aim shovels
Dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent, damage caused by the double-
You, know who, cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you
Signin' marvel, who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, practically marred in marble
His accountless, amount of MC's I saved
And those same niggas want to squander those gifts I gave

Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Change the race by reason, and ashes just the wind

[Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
Love and hatred, home is most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin for the Feds
Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they say
Skip town for a mutten goofy dred
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me
Sign all documents, usin forgery, 'cause just a near thought of me
Like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth 
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell
Embracing her was like embracing a 3rd world

Can you read me? Extorted your rhymes
MC's should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander-n-chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the frisbee, Digi look Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness

So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore; your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical

To be blunt, the beef was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods

The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen

If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records, ranks us, with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred, is the word
You wild cards, Jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions, show their Spades
A large flock of MC's, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear

Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred

Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal

'Fore I bust off
What's the cause? Life loss, high price to pay
For a small reward
Kill for that Bush wick and Horsely broad

I provided the jump cables through to boost the mini-pack
Based on the drama unfolding in a track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like Shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth then act upon it

Or feel the fire's fore view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
That niggas are like kid, flashin' plastic tools
Unaware of the most-year dynastic rule
What stupid!

Without a doubt, it's in the heart where the best darts were written
Sittin' at the window of the grand old earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
'cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach

Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wonder the streets and experiment wit devilish men
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode

The battlefield haunting the daunting
Wu-Tang dance deadly emits six pence
Spiral rifle, barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrapped stifle, survival

Tribal, title secret rival
'Archual' subliminal message throwin'
Bitch niggas holdin' on labels
Mic cables

Capable of slowin' down jets on deck
Fuckin' you straight through continuously
Justice, wit more of the critical penital

Arrow poisonous 'cause my enemy clip's full

Second to get your word up, then the troops unleash

Cease the bullshit, rely on volts
just like watts push the juice through amps
Rap generals runnin troops in camps
Armed with heavy slugs, under rugs, thoughts bugged
No holds barred, live and unplugged
Trapped on the other side, of electrified, steel doors
Once in, greeted with thunderstorm applause
The message breaks the concrete barrier
Launch the vessel, known as the A-1 carrier
Sound goin through a cable, who the fuck able
Mix this shit, but your turntable unstable
So if the beat smash your eardrum, you heard well
Then the two Tech' equalize occurs well
Beats straight off the box, rhyme unorthodox
From the Isle', where the drinks splash straight off the rocks

Analyze the picture, memorize the scripture

No need for cappin' this, brave boys, I break your back with this

Conjurin sandstorms, I'll freeze ya then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These [Incomprehensible], I'm wieldin', straight echoes through the building

Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of a eye
Terminate, unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars while they constellate
The heart rate of my social eloquence makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure

We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch, the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
The snakes out, hissin', shots missin', observe and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin' wit loaded dice
It's like gettin' stabbed with ice and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt

Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flower, fresh shower
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin', ride the 808 rollin'
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster

With more moves than the Tai Chi Master

My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than the fuckin' cactus
Conquerin' globes and universes with Galactus

Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin' intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes, the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate but now I'm yellin' checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die

The herds start stomping, the promoters that be fronting
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that
Security's shining flashlights like where the weed at?
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it

Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men

Raindrops keep falling on your head
So heavy that it's tearing what you're wearing
Ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick, so you know it be authentic
Like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener

Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it 'The Wu, they be about it'
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap

That's the fire till my Clansmen starts to spread terror
Spin your wig back like we DJ'ing, he ain't playing
My songs set a trap, catch 'em laying
Now we stuck but he's overwhelmed by what he came across
Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop

I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio, the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows
Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed
Most of your strength is in the pocket of your clothes
That you endorse in every rhyme like it's Garbeson robes

",Did Ya Say That,2002
GZA,"[Intro: GZA]
This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
They small close in their community with crime
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams
Boy...

[GZA]
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his child passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage

[Interlude: samples]
""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""
	""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
""This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""
	""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""

[GZA]
The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice",Luminal,2002

An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal

How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

[Chorus 4X]",Highway Robbery,2002

For the grip tells told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen

They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost

In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the (?) and the chemical contents of the sun

A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest

We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be,

That Nigga be the GZA from Wu
And if you odn't know
About the piroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize....

Why U-N-I-verse run like clock works forever?
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A story with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments

Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debree
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar

From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)

Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
on his target through a crowded market

But good things take time to create
You can find me in your studio

Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands

Designer and most of man

Powerful motor controls are mad stable
No room for error, injury proves fatal
Hundred ton air-jack, quickly raise the steel
After blowin' out the belt drive, Math' change the wheels
Bust ya, slash ya, we still thick like plaster
There's always potential full-on scale disasters
In the rec' [?] narrowly missin'
My camp be forced into periless proposition
We must come see ya, despite imminent danger
Was short on fuel, before he flew out the hangar
From the cold dirt, rocks and all, rap galore
Watch the river flow backwards once we storm the shore
Nigga, mark with razor-sharp eyes of the scope
On the ropes, hanging from the towel and cliffs and slopes
The magnitude of the devastation untold
The collective laws of countless souls lay in the road

Got to go to the game and I hold the main controller
Soldiers from the jump, and today the same soldier
I stay low, play close to bank rolls
Polly with the greatest who walk the same road
Oh you ain't hear? Ain't nuttin' new but the gear

We rhyme back-to-back, deangerous emcees
Move on track-to-track 100 bar measure
Lost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure
Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood
eventually they would 
Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle 
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble

Engine powered by five hundred horses 
Press by a threat of joint forces

Now do your mission and while you were thinking 
Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming 

Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in

Submerged in deep blocks of ice

Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch 
The rat squeals 
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals 
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles 

Here the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees 
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves 
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk 

Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk 
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain 
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra 

He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah 
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet 
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 

So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see 
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators 
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later 
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees 

The tick moved with the fleas 
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas 
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow 
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough 

See a million mosquitos from the West now 
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild

The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark 
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark 
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved 

And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist 
And the bats use their sonar to guide and a**ist 
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale 
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail 

The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes 
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes 
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor 
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula 

They both prey on gra**hoppers beetles and flies 
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies 
What costs little, is a little worth 
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf 

From birth they grow up walking the thin line

GZA,"I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck, tt was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven

And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood

We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak

And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood

Smoke on a deserted street just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals right from the start
That'll rip out your heart and consume the fattest part

Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant he was so far from free

Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast

He said this individual killed for low billings
And purchased a murder kit blocks from the killing

The sheriff's office had no time to waste
Plus the inmate never deal to avoid the case
So he cooperated fully and snitched on his chop shop mechanic
Who used to move bodies on the pulley

An extortionist involved in similar incidents
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments
Suspicious activities that flooded the place
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls were traced

The hair that was taken from his car interior
Was that of a young girl who felt inferior
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger
Holding off her life as she faced the strangler

The crime seemed to be sexual from nature
It was substantial evidence that the nigga raped her
The suspects had marks on his face and chest
But it just wasn't enough to get an arrest

Asked of his whereabouts on the third of July
Said he partied with his friends and had a solid alibi
But there's always something left at the scene on a small scale

This language is so captivating
When we lose a rap nigga, the news is devastating

Whether to the prison or grave, you know this rap shit
Is built from the strength of those to hunger the crave
My Clan got rhymes for days to be skilled, it pays
Most of them can't escape the solar rays

Let alone try to hold the pen that I write with
You can even chop off my fingers I type with
Those I hold a mic with, thinking I might quit

They didn't know, that only makes me more determined
Ich lebe fur hip hop, you can ask the Germans
Some say I never got this for recognition
So I drop another, they shocked and still listen

The clock ran out, the ref throw the sign, it's over time
The rambling, visiting teams scheme
The championship ring fending, they must be dreaming

These rap players and slayers got a lot of endorsements
Make them hire law enforcements
Plus, I just turned down tracks, can't remember the
Producer with the beats is wack, sound similar

It gotta be exciting, striking, lightning
Bring the best out, to dawn through Harlem
Writing, light stroke from my pen might choke
The tape lent, got a little air, then half the spins

M.C.'s be stuck with fear fascination
The nature in the scale of events, shook the station

And my hand take hold on judgment
I will take vengeance upon my enemies
And I will repay those that hazed me

When you got bass all in your face
Sub woofers pumpin' all throughout the place
A fake rap nigga tryna plead his case
It's about to be a catastrophe

And if you got beehives right before your eyes
About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies followed by some cries
It's about to be a catastrophe

Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef 'til they get caught in smoke
But the problem is never cured, on top of that
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators watch the human drama
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor

A homicidal attempt that had failed
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled
He talked a good one but it was make believe
Much too low for the human ear to perceive
He confused science fiction with science facts
He couldn't separate the block from the recorded tracks

What some talk about had little or no bearing
Could the next be some real shit that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings

Through the years, a countless number of victories
Changing the era we swarm unpredictably
A rhyme book is not difficult to manage
I leave a mic in a bandage from catastrophic damage

Rap niggaz on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather
Scuffed up but remained durable as old leather

But I hold the pen, you feel the whiff of Polo wind
Something like Jesus, when he civilize older men
The math that shed light all across the borders

GZA,"She dated Jolly Green Giants, that flew on jets
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially bears
Was a role model, like a Cardinal to our peers

A patriotic tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a dolphin
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore bangles
Drove a Bronco and she was far from Star Spangled

Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, 'cause she was behind them bills
Had a man who always roared like lion
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying

Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""Ten I See"", you just need to tighten your game

Her ancestors were chiefs, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the Seahawks, who battled the buccaneers
The redskin garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners

They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at cowboys and 49ers
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical

She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started Texan her, soon as my plane had touch down
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the Jaguar

Her brown skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a raven
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her

There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were vikings
Militant as panthers, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the charger

I introduced myself to gain yardage
Cause anything less then smooth, would of been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, steelers and panty raiders

She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would of been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line

Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was 'bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to packer, as she stroked my helmet

And I was thinking these girls was saints
But it was first and ten and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a colt, before I released them puddles

They spread eagles like wide receivers
As I ram them in the end zone, and they became true believers

I be liking chess
Cause chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess

Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward
Only armed with the bow and a mad flow
Poisonous arrows on a mark that was set to go

Traveling at high speeds towards a target

He was the greatest sam-urai in the empire;
And he was the Shogun's decapitator.
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords.

It was a bad time for the empire.
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out.
People said his brain was infected by DEVILS.
My father would come home -- he would forget about the killings.

He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him.
Maybe that was the problem.
Then, one night... the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house.
They were supposed to kill my father... but they didn't.

That was the night everything changed *voice fades*

I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crime

Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Into the chamber, and it's a whole different sound

Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn and ripped up
Stripped up, shacked up and backed up from fiends
'Cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up

Kids are slingin' in my lobby, little Steve and Bobby
Gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek

Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin' hectic

My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title

I'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol

You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid, come home from doin' the bid and nuthin' changes

What is the meaning of crime
Is it criminals robbin' innocent motherfuckers every time?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard

Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like the umpire

But it's an everlasting game
And it never cease to exist
Only the players change

So I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back, I gotcha back

This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a 44 banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I pay homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with the Lord-Justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Philadelphia to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And ya'll are more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gonna die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here leave your frame backless
The police always trying to aim flame at us
So I don't mind when a pig brain splatters
I don't mind that we all gonna die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb

yeah...vinnie paz baby...yeah...yeah...yeah

There is no escaping once my blade start scraping
My sword indeed make more niggaz bleed

So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed

Imagine a rhyme in it's prime from off the baseline
Skyscraper a vertical support the hang time
Evidence that was left at the scene of the crime
Trace back to a few from outta group of nine
Who performed well regardless to the price of the ticket
Off or on stage whatever still kickin'
With the footwork of Freddy Adu, its all new,
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe
With the rose now, and its difficult to climb
With the heat and wind and fallen rocks combined
Its hard to stay alined the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber the force it unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman blaze sharp, I'll cut out your heart
Mc's want no part of any type of conflict
Be 'cause when I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change

Punch the data in ya mainframe

Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
Your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this

Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar, ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Reservoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13

And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch

Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman

While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart

I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala
Max mostly, undivided, then slide it, it's sickening
Guaranteed, mad em jump like Rod Strickland",Triumph,2008

Shoot out the speakers when my guns get Jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gun play I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds

Better, respect it, bitch believe

I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe

We in them authentic alley switchin' joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin' me now respect get your fingers off the glass

Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin' for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin' yo, big fat nigga bleedin'
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

[Chorus]

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor, coming from the RZA

The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
Are-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to snuggle you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little rock'll turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge

[Masta Killa]
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is MC'ing at it's best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul to war us, be the growlest
Asiatic arctic flow is so frigid

[RZA]
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Wu, so coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distressed like the damsal, lost like little Hansel
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Gold-plated desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the neighbor yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being took and operated
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, ark, who goes there?
Power-you smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Ain't nothing but bones, we plotted the sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See-Cypher Pigs, can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a click that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic

Both of them turned green from counting the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue
And kid yo, I never rocked with laws they keep away, we cool
I devised my own stimulus plan, I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice
To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque
Let the imam pray over my head and wash

Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets
Nabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim

The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, distance, places be forming wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub
As He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
Seven hundred books were opened
Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean
Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed
God felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea
Satan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty
K.P., K.P

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as the fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug will sell your garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, the household dramatic
Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts
Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem

Falsche Freunde gehen, echte Brüder bleiben

Wollen Stress haben
Kein Problem! Man sieht sich demnächst in der S-Bahn

Krokos die beißen, die meinen das ernst!
Gib uns was ab, man, der Scheiß war kein Scherz

Die Klamotten gefälscht, doch die Treter sind echt

Kein Eigenheim, doch ich steiger mein Hype
Bin bereit für Streit! Bist du bereit für Streit?
Ratatata macht der Motherfucker
Mach das mal nach was der Macker da macht
Sag das nochmal, man wir scheißen auf Hundert

H,"You are the deep water
You are the thin ice
The edge of the high cliff
And the November fires
You are my church bells
And the silent early hours
You are the ghost I hear
Echo in the half-light
Ecstasy and heart failure
Trembling and pounding in the magic spell
You are my wild flower and my wishing well
The spinning cut crystal above my bed
that dazzles and jabs me
Indigo blue and postbox red
I run away and away and away from you and everyone
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
I make believe I make excuses I make fun
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
Oh my love
I know what I am
A lost cause
Selfish beyond forgiveness
Oh my heart
Knows what I am
A lost cause

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.

Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",2002

Time and again
I've been here to fill your dreams
Tonight I'm gonna show you
Love is closer that it seems
And just like before

I can't believe it
You're standing here in front of me
Like a promise
Like a breath of honesty
I surrender to this feeling in my soul
And my heart's desire
Can't pretend I'm not about to lose control
I'm falling for the fire

Chorus
Love has never ever looked so beautiful
Never ever felt so wonderful
So wonderful
There's no turning back
I'm falling for the fire
Love is making me believe in miracles
Making me believe I'm home again
I'm whole again
There's no turning back
No turning back from here

You won me over
In just a second the skies were clear
I saw the sunrise, I heard the music
And lost my fear
I surrender to this feeling in my soul
And my heart's desire
Can't pretend I'm not about to lose control
I'm falling for the fire

Chorus

I'll sing you a love song
Write you a letter
Paint you a picture
Of how it could be
I'll sing you a love song
Last you a lifetime
Open your eyes and you'll see
It's you and me

Chorus

I was wishin on the stars
I was prayin for a sign
And tryin to beat the odds
I was dreamin of you
Long before I saw your face
And there you were baby
Waitin for that day
Then you reached through the hurricane
When you baby you called my name

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs…..
There you were

Must have broke into heaven
Just to roll back the clouds
Were you on a mission
Were you seekin me out
Was I that one in a million
Was I that one sacred kiss
That you couldn't chance
You just couldn't miss
Then you whispered through the silent tears
When you, you swept away all my fears

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby you are the fire
Burnin the midnight sky 
And your love 
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone

There you were

Standin in the middle of nowhere
With your arms wide open and you
You were the reason when there was no reason
In my life
You're the reason in my life

H & Claire,"Used to be we had so much to say
Always thought that love would last and time would slip away
But now I'm only dreaming of those endless summer days
And how they fade to gray, wish it was yesterday

One day we're gonna laugh about it
Maybe they'll write a song about it
But now I'm too close to tears
Too hurt to talk anymore

One day you're gonna meet me somewhere
We'll look back without a care
But now I'm too close to tears, it's too bad we lost
I don't wanna talk about us anymore

It's funny how a day can change your life
You wake up and realize there's nothing left inside
Nobody wants to say the words, it's easier to hide
There's something you should know
It's harder to let you go

One day we're gonna laugh about it
Maybe they'll write a song about it
But now I'm too close to tears
Too hurt to talk anymore

One day you're gonna meet me somewhere
We'll look back without a care
But now I'm too close to tears
It's too bad we lost

I don't wanna talk about us
I don't wanna talk about us
Now it's too late we've gone too far
We've lost that dream along the way
Now there's no time for happy endings

One day we're gonna laugh about it
Maybe they'll write a song about it
But now I'm too close to tears
Too hurt to talk anymore

Remember girls that were my destiny 
Those feelings that were always inside of me 
Always I thought - BAM - there was reality 

My heart my insight once had a bright light 
Forever I thought but I never know 
That that kinda love, onesided and not given back 
Would break my heart, yeah and would break my back 

So never again I vowed to the earth and sea 
To trust to rely on girls to set love free 
Feel the thing in my heart the way it's been before 
But life was gonna teach me, down in N.Y.C 

So my memories full of fear and agony 
I experienced the way when love is set free 
Revealed by both though never said through words 
But this time love failed 'cause distance sealed it

Think about the Real Love! 

So I was back, back in the place 
Where I started before not willing to love 
Show feelings no more, wrong time, 
Wrong place they said to myself, what a disgrace 

'Cause then it happened, emotions continuity 
Took it's toll prepared today's reality 
Courage and luck on my side and inside of me 
Are-E-A-L-I-T-why, it's been to me 

Like a dream I had as a little child 
With a thousand colours totally wild 
Bleedin' into one embracing themselves 
Brighter and more fluorescent than anything else 

And now I'm back, back in my reality 
Looking at my life, my love and feel the 
Essence of thruth, ethereal eternity 
I finally found it, God I love reality!

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I used to think that the day would never come

And when I turned ten I began to like a friend All things deal with emotions from you until the end, oh

Emotions make you sad sometimes
Emotions make you glad sometimes
But most of all they make you fall in love.

H-Town,"It's a thin line between love and hate 
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning 
And you're just getting in 
You knock on the door 
And a voice sweet and low says who is it
She opens up the door and lets you in 
Never once asks where have you been 
She says are you hungry? 
Did you eat yet? 
Let me hang up your coat 
Pass me your hat 
All the time she's smiling 
Never once raises her voice 
It's five o'clock in the morning 
You don't give it a second thought

It's a thin line between love and hate 

The sweetest woman in the world 
Could be the meanest woman in the world 
If you make her that way 
You keep hurting her 
She'll keep being quiet 
She might be holding something inside 
That'll really, really hurt you one day

I see you're in the hospital 
Bandaged from foot to head 
In a state of shock 
Just that much from being dead 
You couldn't believe the girl 
Would do something like this, ha 
You didn't think the girl had the nerve 
But here you are 
I guess action speaks louder than words

H. Aviles,"Nadie...
Comprende lo que sufro yo
Canto...
Pues ya no puedo sollozar
Solo...
Temblando de ansiedad estoy
Todos...
Me miran why se van

Mujer...
Si puedes tu con Dios hablar
Preguntale si yo alguna vez
Te he dejado de adorar

Al mar 
Espejo de mi corazon
Las veces que me ha visto llorar
La perfidia de tu amor

Te he buscado por do'quiera que yo voy
Why no te puedo hayar
Para que quiero otros besos
Si tus labios no me quieren ya besar

Why tu...
Quien sabe por donde andaras
Quien sabe que aventura tendras
Que lejos estas de mi

Te he buscado por do'quiera que yo voy
Why no te puedo hayar
Para que quiero otros besos

Que lejos estas de mi
De mi",Perfidia,1994
H. Aviles,"Tus besos se llegaron a recrear
Aquí en mi boca
Llenando de ilusión y de pasión
Mi vida loca
Las horas mas felices de mi amor
Fueron contigo
Por eso es que mi alma siempre extraña
El dulce alivio
Te puedo yo jurar ante un altar
Mi amor sincero
A todo el mundo le puedes contar
Que si te quiero
Tu labios me enseñaron a sentir
Lo que es ternura
y nunca dejare de bendecir
Tanta dulzura",Contigo,1995
H. Aviles,"Como un rayito de luna
Entre la selva dormida
Asi la luz de tus ojos ha iluminado
Mi pobre vida

Tu diste luz al sendero
En mi noche sin fortuna
Iluminando mi cielo como un rayito 
Claro de Luna

Rayito de luna blanca
Que iluminas mi camino 
Asi es tu amor en mi vida
La verdad de mi destino

Tu diste luz al sendero
En mi noche sin fortuna
Iluminando mi cielo como un rayito 
Claro de Luna
