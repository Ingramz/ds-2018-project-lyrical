Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger!

Where oh where can he be?
Low or highbrow, they all cry now
""Please play that Tiger Rag for me""

Capt. John Handy & the Easy Riders Jazz Band,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Capt. John Handy & the Easy Riders Jazz Band,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

Captain,"A spirit for a smile
A doubt for a dream
You're saving my falling
You're shooting my star

A spirit for a smile
A doubt for a dream
You're saving my falling
You're shooting my star

And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there

Oh, oh

You're the beat of my heart
The door to my home
If I lose my voice
Then I'm left alone

You're the way that I can see
You're the best champagne
Yes, you cure my loathes
And joy steals my pain

And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there

Built this island out of frustration
There's no point teaching a girl who can never learn
And just when I feel like Robinson Crusoe
My intentions strobe to light, a beacon out in the sea
I caught your eye and you're staring back at me
Great minds coming to the same idea

'Cause when it keeps on whispering in your ear
Keeps on whispering in your ear
Keeps on whispering in your ear
Wait for something and it never appears

Oh, no
And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there

So why don't I just take your strain until the sun dies
You're staring at the ocean, not afraid to bring it to life
We're not afraid to bring it to life

You're the beat of my heart
I said oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart",Broke,2006

In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face

You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through

And share your dreams with me

And maybe watch the rubber tongue, when it comes out
From the puffed, and flanulent mexican rubbergoods mask.

Make me buy the flosser.
Make me grow brainiac fingers.

In the laboratory of the utility muffin Research kitchen.
Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon,
He gathers an Intimate quantity of dried muffin
Remnants and brushing his scapular aside,
Procceds to dump these inside of his shirt...
He turns to us and speaks:

""Some people like cupcakes better.
I for one care less for them!""

Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas 
Snoot of a fully charged icing anointment utensil,
He 'poot's forths a quarter-ounce green rosette,
- oh ah yuk, yuk... let's try that again...! -
He 'poots' forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
Near the summit of a dense,
But radiant muffin of his own design.
Later he says:

""Some people... some people like cupcakes
Exclusively, while myself, I say,
There is naught nor ought there be nothing 
So exalted on the face of god's grey
Earth as that prince of foods... the muffin!""

The match struck blue on a railroad rail
The old puff horse was just pullin' through
And a man wore a pegleg forever

I'm on the bum where the hobos run
The air breaks with filthy chatter
Oh I don't care there's no place there,  don't think it matters

One stick poked down
Gray of age fell down on a pair of ears
An eagle shined through my whole watch pocket

A gingham girl, baby girl, passed me by in tears
A jack rabbit raised his folded ears
A beautiful sagebrush jack rabbit

And an oriole sang like an orange
His breast full o'worms
And his tail clawed the evenin' like a hammer
His wings took to air like a bomber

And my rain can caught me a cup o'water
When I got into town
Odd-jobs mam, ah your horse, I'll fodder
I'm the round house man, I once was your father

A little up the road, a wooden candy-stripe barber pole
And above it read a sign, ""Painless Parker""

Licorice twisted around under a fly
And a youngster cocked her eye
God, before me if I'm not crazy, is my daughter

Come, little one, with your little old dimpled fingers
Gimme one and I'll buy you a cherry phosphate

Take you down to the foamin' brine and water
And show you the wooden tits on the Goddess
With the pole out full sail, that tempted away your pegleg father

And a soft lass with brown skin

And galloped off into the moonbeams
She pulled up her blouse
Compared her navel to the moon

So she rolls around all night

I'm just saw the thread with a drooped body
I'll set up with ya, big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daylight
I'll stay up all night

I won't droop if you won't talk about your hands bein' too small
You know something's happenin'
Or you wouldn't off come out like you did

She ain't built for goin' naked
So she can't wear any new clothes or go to the beach
They laugh at her body 'cause her hands are too small

When big Joan sits up
Her hands are too small
She's out of reach

A turquoise scarf and sleeve
Rolled up over a Merc Montclair

I'll sit up with you big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daytime
I'll stay up all night
If you promise not to talk about your hands bein' too small

Captain Harry,"Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, worries, it worries me, shame and scandal in the family

Love - I'm trying to hold
Weaker I get everyday
Lose control of the things that I say

Tell me how can I get right
Like a day without his bite
Don't know which way to go
Don't know what I'm looking for

Meditate all the time
Hoping that I can find
A ladder that I can climb
To get this off my mind

Until then I'll just be trapped
In her arms I'm deeply wrapped
Until I lose control and start
To scream and scold

Show me a land where
Someone like me
Can make a stand
Make any living 

When all that you can
Is tear down all you don't understand
I find you're a little impossible
I find you're a little impossible
Impossible to me

Time is breathless - you better check 
This way we're livin' is wreckless
Jealousy kill the people with envy
Lack of self control that could be

The answer that you're throwing on
To a life style that ya showin' on
So go on with your bad self until
Find ya life in a shelf

Checking your beeper
Trying to keep her
Most of the time can't even sleep
Living large - she's in charge

With his brim pulled way down low

How do you think I'm going to get along,
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
And kicked me out on my own

How long can you stand the heat

Like to find a little hole in the ground

And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It`s just like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you`ll be smilin`

Your sister`s gone out. She`s on a date
You just sit at home and masturbate
The phone is gonna ring soon but you just can`t wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in you New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
But still your finger`s gonna pick your nose

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah but there`s no place to go anyway
And what for...
You`ve got everything, but nothing`s cool
They`ve just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won`t be going back to school
Anymore...

And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight

And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh, but still you`re aching for the things you have not got
What went wrong...
And if you can`t understand why your world is so dead
And why you`ve got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you`re twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that`s too long...

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,1963

Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Always callin' a woman out a name,
Callin' her a ""bee-eye-itch"" now that's a shame.
What if somebody called your woman that?
You'd be all up at the century club, boy, with your stri-nap.

You just mad 'cause I got more hos than you got diamonds on your rolex.

I realize after makin' six platinum's in a row
The shit was easy, so I had to get some mo'.
I never did like stiff hos.
I fuck like a rap, ain't no quick flows.

It won't happen as long as she's my bitch.
I give a fuck if you fake pimps peep my shit,
'Cause I'm a mack these hos like never befo',
And every time I grab the mic I gotta better flow.

I went from rappin' about the clothes I was wearin' at a party,
To all the hos that let me see their naked bodies.
It's not an overnight transition thing,
I wasn't born pimpin' hos, wearin' pinky rings.
Never walked around sayin', ""Who am I?""
'Cause when I seen old movies like ""Superfly,""
It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy,
And reach levels other niggas never see.
In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on.
One day I said somethin' on the microphone
About sixteen hoes, suckin' ten toes,
People loved it, that's how the story goes.

Like a house party, or a side show,

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando

We used to listen to the radio and stare out at the sea
I know you don't recall that song we heard

It's nothing to you it was everything to me
I'm weary of this tired town and wary of its vices
And we were finished years ago, I'm sure that you'd agree
""Don't know you anymore,"" is all you say
""And you're back out on the road tomorrow anyway.""

Not bound to this desolate place
This time tomorrow I'll be gone
1400 miles and moving
Leave these troubled streets behind
Forget the look on your desolate face
This time tomorrow I'll be no one
Nothing but a ghost of something fading in the dust
Of all you have and all you know and all you see
All you'll have is this memory of me
I've nothing left to leave with you -
Just leave you with your silence
But I would give a fortune to know
What's churning in your head
Because the sentiment of your silent smile
Has silently been killing me all the while
What I would give to get inside your skull
Sort through all the things you haven't said

And every time you say you'll never make it to the end
Remember the truth because its you that I trust
You walk so many miles
All the water you tread
Just remember all the times it was over your head
And after all the lies you told the truth instead
This is your life you should never have a single regret
Scream as loud as you can
You gotta get up and dance
Here's the moment don't let it go even if its breaking your hands

There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks

And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again

Love never fails
But where there are prophecies, they will cease where there are tongues
They will be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away
For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child
When I abandoned my childhood, I put these ways behind me
For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face
Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known

And now these two remain",Famous Prophets (Stars),2011

Hello, my name is Hojin Stella Jung, I am a senior at McQueen high school
My portfolio is a collection of paintings that was created during last summer 
And the first half of my senior year and it's called The Lady
And I didn't feel very well when I painted the first
And I didn't feel very well when I painted the last
And it was intense, it was an intense process, and it was how I was trying tovery hard
Personify that intensity, but it's hard to talk about her now because 
I think she wasn't me, at least that's how I feel
And I'm trying to figure out what to do now
Like she represents ferver in woman, she is powerful yet fragile
She stares but also averts her gaze
And I love her, at least I did and
But now I feel lost
And unsure of what to think and feel most of the time
But I did believe in her, The Lady
And maybe there is a different form now that the intensity takes

She loves her love and love is no more

â??Tis out in the meadow this fair maid did go
Picking the lovely primrose
The more she plucked the more she pulled
Until she's got her apron full

She climbed on yonder hill above
To give a rose unto her love
She gave him one, she gave him three
She gave her heart for company

And as they sat on yonder hill
His heart grew hard, so harder still
He has two hearts instead of one
She says, young man what have you done

How foolish, foolish you must be
To think I loved no one but thee
This world's not made for one alone
I take delight in everyone",She's Like the Swallow,2002
Cara Dillon,"Bonny, bonny was my seat in the red rosy yard
And bonny was my ship in the town of Ballynagard
Shade and shelter was for me till I began to fail
You all may guess now my distress lies near the Nightingale

Grief and woe that I must go to fight for England's King
I neither know his friend or foe, and war's a cruel thing
The nightingale is near at hand, my time at home is brief
And Carey's steams and mountain land I part with bitter grief

No more I'll walk the golden hills with Nancy by my side
Or dream along the sun bright rills, or view my land with pride
We sail away at dawn of day, the sails are ready set
When old Benmore I see no more, I'll sigh with deep regret

Now all must change and I must range across the ocean wide
Our ship she may in Biscay's Bay lie low beneath the tide
If I should fall by cannon ball, or sink beneath the sea
Good people all, a tear let fall and mourn for mine and me

If God should spare me my greying hair and bring me back again
I'd love far more my Antrim shore, its dark blue hills and rain
Around the fires, my heart's desires, heaven grant till life shall fail
And keep me far from the cruel war and from the Nightingale",Bonny Bonny,2004

Every blow

Broken bridges, wish I could lie down
Freedom angels come and save me now
So I lost my fortune then found it in a glen

Will we learn to wait until tomorrow
Not knowing where we'll go

Cara Dillon,"Farewell to old Ireland, the land of my childhood
Which now and forever I am going to leave
Farewell to the shores, where the shamrock is growing
It's the bright spot of beauty and the home of the brave

I'll think on its valleys with fond admiration
Though never again its bright hills will I see
I'm bound for to cross the wide swelling ocean
In search of fame and fortune and of sweet liberty

Our ship at the present lies in Derry harbour
To bear us away across the wide swelling sea
May heaven be her companion and grant her fair breezes
Till we reach the green fields of America

It's hard to be forced from the land that we live in
Our houses and farms all obiged for to sell
To wander along among Indians and strangers
To find some sweet spot where our children might dwell

Our artists, our farmers, our tradesmen are leaving
To seek for employment far over the sea
Where they'll get their riches with care and with industry
There's nothing but hardship at home if you stay

So cheer up your spirits, you lads and you lasses
There's gold for the digging and lots of it, too
A health to the heart that has courage to ramble
Bad luck to the lad or the lass that would rue

We'll call for a bumper of ale, wine and brandy
We'll drink to the health of those far away
Our hearts will all warm at the thought of old Ireland
When we're on the green fields of Americay",The Emigrant's Farewell,2004
Cara Dillon,"Oh draw near each young lover,
Give ear to my story
That bears my sad, mournful tale.
Come join me in chorus
And lend me your pity,
While I my misfortune bewail. 

The grief my poor heart
No tongue can disclose.
My cheeks are now pale,
They once bloomed like the rose.
And it's all for a young man,
Whom I do suppose
Is now far from sweet Erin the Green.

Now when were children
We walked out together
Along the green meadows sweet. 
And although we were childish
We loved one another
Whilst gathering the wild berries sweet. 

It was to sweet Garvagh where we were sent to school,
He was first in his class 
And correct in each rule.
And I cheerfully walked home by Kilnacoole
With the flower of sweet Erin the Green.

Oh his head on my breast
And he used to repose
At each evening under the shade.
A song in my praises my darling composed
And he styled me the cool Derry maid.
At the time I denied him I'd die for his sake,
It was little I thought my denial he'd take.

Oh, but my own misfortune
I made a mistake
When he left me on Erin the Green.",Erin the Green,2004

All things left unsaid, that were in my mind
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw

Sandy hills all around, nothing standing clear
Softly light is falling through, time was never here
When I stood on this deck, stranges things I saw
STRANGE THEY HAVE VANISHED NOW
I'm standing on the shore

Headlands fading out of sight, horizons disappear
Hazy shores and silent seas, nothing DO I fear
Air and water, grass and sand, merging into one
In the silence of the mist, I am still alone

Strange they have vanished now

With treasures rich and rare.

To scenes of long ago;
Across the sea to the Benedy
And the winding river roe. 

Right well do I remember now
Those happy childhood days.
And the times I had when just a lad,
On Carn's lovely braes. 
And when my mind is thus inclined
No other joys I know,
For my heart remains on the verdant plains
Near the winding river roe. 

Benbradagh's crown o'er Dungiven town,
Is still within my view
And the Benedy glen I worshiped then
Still lives in memory too.
The beautiful scene of Cashel Green
Still haunts wherever I go.
And in all my dreams, I see it seems
The winding river roe. 

If fortunes smiles on me awhile,
I would cross the sea again,
And all these years of toil and tears
Will be forgotten then.

Cara Dillon,"""Oh rise up my darling and come with me
I want to go with you and leave this country
To leave my fathers dwelling, this house and the land
So away goes Jamie with his love in his arms

They go over hills and the mountains and glens
Traveling all through the night in the mist in the rain
But her father has followed and has taken his men
And he captured poor Jamie with his love in his arms

Now home she was taken to her room she is bound
While poor Jamie lies on the cold stoney ground
And he knows all the while before the judge he will stand
For the stealing of nothing but his own true love's hand

In the cold hard iron his hands they are bound
Handcuffed like a murderer and tied to the ground
And the goaler tells Jamie ""last night I did hear
That your Lady will hang you or else set you clear""

The judge says ""this young girl being tender in youth
If Jamie is guilty she will tell the truth""
Then the radiant beauty before him did stand
""Oh I'm happy to see you my bold Irish lad""

But the father cries out ""Lord have pity on me
For the man came to bring disgrace to my family
And he stole my only daughter, all part of his plan
And if you don't hang him I will quit the land""

But the daughter is crying and begging is she
""The fault isn't Jamie's the blame lies with me
I forced him to leave and run away with me
And I'll die if I can't save my bold Jamie""

""Good Lord he has stole all her jewels and her rings
Gold watches and amber, all my precious things
And it costs me a fortune in thousands of pounds
And I'll take the life of Jamie before I lie in the ground

An when we are parted I'll have them removed
But a true lovers token wear on your right hand
And think of me darling when you're in a foreign land""",Bold Jamie,2006
Cara Dillon,"One night as I lay slumbering in my silent bed alone
Some reckless thoughts came to my mind which caused me for to roam
To leave my native country and the wee girl I do adore
So I thought it fit to take a trip, strange lands for to explore

Now the night before I went away I was walking over Brockagh Hill
When I met my darling on the road and her eyes with tears did fill
""Stay you at home dear John"" she said ""and do not go away
For I'll have none to comfort me when you are on the sea""

Well I took her by the lily white hand and I held her hard and fast
Saying ""adieu to you my darling for my ship it lies in Belfast
But if you prove loyal sure I'll prove true for you know that I'm well inclined""
So we kissed goodbye and parted and I left my girl behind

And when we landed in Greenock sure the people all gathered around
And they said I was a rakish lad come to put their harvest down
They told me to return again and never more be seen
So without delay I sailed away for Ireland's lovely green

Sure when Mary heard that John was home her heart did beat with joy
Saying ""come into my arms"" she cried ""you're my darling lovely boy""

Cara Dillon,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

Cara Salimando,"And she was just 
Another lullaby 
With candlelight eyes 
Singing you to sleep 
Drowsy with heat 

And you were just 
A warning to avoid 
Asleep upon the soil 
Holding onto night 
Fading with its light 
Fading with its light

[Chorus]
And your heart was a bird, scared still and alone, and the only thing she ever cared for 
With wings tattered and torn beating unevenly, beating unevenly 

And your heart was a bird scared still and alone and the only thing she ever cared for 
When your heart was forgotten, alone on the floor, she picked it up, brushed it of dust, brushed it of, dust 

And you were just, a love drunk vagabond
With little reason to hold on 
Pressed against the glass
Watching people pass 
Watching people pass

[Chorus] 

And you both intermingled 
Beautiful and as simple 
And you both intermingled 
Beautiful and simple as dust 
As dust 

And you were just, another lullaby
With candlelight eyes, 
Signing her to sleep 
Singing her to sleep",Dust,
Cara Tivey,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She
(We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home
(We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?

She
(We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
(Never a thought for ourselves)
Home
(We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She
(What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having
(We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun
(Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for
(Bye bye)
So many years

She's leaving home
(Bye bye)

Sounds of scene where often been of depression and despair
People laughing and joking, drinking and smoking, they are not aware
Of the guy or his song as the piano plays on, they don't really care

He's just paid to please them, he's a clown without a face
A sound to fill their silence, a soul that leaves no trace
Every happy song is drowned in, drowned in sorrow
Yet no one sees the tears in his eyes
His dreams are gone, no special song, no tomorrow
No chorus as his spirit slowly dies

In the hazy gloom of this living tomb, a stripper earns her pay
To lusty cheers and the drunken leers, the piano fades away
As she sheds her clothes in a vulgar pose, she strips him of all pride
Yet he plays on such a desperate song, feels a savage changing tide

Won't someone help me?
I just want to play my song
If only you would only listen
I'd be so happy if you all would sing along
I'd have the things that I've been missing

But very soon came the final tune, no worry turned to song
Just an empty stool and a stagehand's call, his weakness was too strong
So twisted and high while starting to fly, he saw the changing tide
And he followed its will, until all was still, the piano player died",Piano Player,1986

A gift of love to fill your eyes, to fill your eyes
And if I turn your head awhile, my heart will sing
Thunder songs of love to make you smile

I've traveled far in search of things I didn't know
I could have found as well at home as in the skies
There's so much time misspent in dreams of wealth and fame
When all you need is love in your eye

Take a cup of new found wealth
Drink it down and do yourself
Let your feelings tell you why
Have no fear for lonely days
Mind in hand you'll find a way
You must believe me till you've tried

Caravan,"Standing on a golf course
Dressed in P.V.C.
I chanced upon a golf girl
Selling cups of tea
She asked me did I want one
Asked me with a grin
For three pence you can buy one
Full right to the brim

So of course I had to have one
In fact I ordered three
So I could watch the golf girl
Could see she fancied me
And later on the golf course
After drinking tea
It started raining golf balls
And she protected me

Her name was Pat
And we sat under a tree
She kissed me
We go for walks
In fine weather
All together

We talk in Morse",Golf Girl,1994
Caravan,"Up on a hill top, far from the city
Overlooking a stream
I heard a sound, it made me look round
I looked back where I had just been
There just behind a ledge
There was a man he leapt to and fro
Clipping away at a hedge

Suddenly I heard a ringing singing
But he was nowhere to be seen

Pulling my trousers up to my knees
I waded across the stream
Back to the place where I could hear sounds
And where the old man once had been
There just behind a ledge
I looked about, I couldn't make out
Where he had been clipping the hedge

I could not hear what he was singing

When we'd ride to a dock on bended knee

With a feeling of you still that was my own

Oh, I would love to, love to love you
Yes, indeed, I do love you, love you
My, my, pigs might fly, that can't be bad

A man came through the wall and stood by me

Think of me now while you're yawning, sunshine the tears from my cries 
What I see I know is real, what I touch I know I feel 
If I don't care for what you say, it won't mean much to me today 
 
For I see your world that is living, my mind is yours, yours is mine 
Don't talk to me bout forgiving, so much to do, no more time 
All my love goes straight to you with just a thought for something new 
All I have is what you feel with hands in mouth, you gently kneel 
 
What I see I know is real, what I touch I know I feel 
All my love goes straight to you, all my love is you
 
There's a place where I can go, where I listen to the wind singing 
Songs of happiness I know, and it brings it all back again 
Somewhere deep inside of me, there's a song that I can sing 
Jigsaw puzzles on a tree, and it brings it all back again 
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow? 
There are people waiting here who really want to know 
 
And sometimes I think of wine, songs and laughter flowing free 
People talking all the time, and it brings it all back to me 
 
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow? 
There are people waiting now who really have to know 
 
Can't you feel it in the air? I wonder what it's meant to be 
Its the thought that can`t' be spared, and it brings it all back to me 
Yes it brings it all back to me",Nine Feet Underground,1994

I can't see what was happening

Please hear the love I bring for you to follow
Come with me, with diamonds in the sea
And stare the hearts of men whose fight in sorrow
It's foolish to suppose you know me well, I know
Everything that I touch won't turn to gold
Money's not my way although your own lost soul's
Waiting for the day to break that hole

And I love you
I've never loved someone like I do
I love you
The world is yours if you want me to
I love you
I've never loved someone like I do

Whisper please some scandal to the trees
I'm sure they would enjoy themselves enormously
Will you and I sit up in the sky
And chase our minds through space and time relentlessly?

If the time is right, we bid a fond farewell

Then seldom find the time they know so well

How you`re always flowing, blowing in my mind 
Like a stream, these magic waters move me to a dream 
Of travelling with you, drifting carefree, dropping downward through fresh grasses 
Bubbles merrily as it passes, never knowing where you`re going 
Carry me with you, carry me with you 
 
Be conjured up in a midnight dream, ancient castles dark 
As wandering minstrels play tunes of yesterday 
When dragons roamed the land, knights in armour gold 
Charged on horseback bold 
The maids were saved, the dragons slayed 
 
Sail scene, sea green, sailing forward to a new land 
Treasure waits, paradise gates, for the taking, can`t start waiting 
All you need, but take heed, remember it pays to pay the sandman well 
Make no fuss, for you must, in stardust, he puts all the colours in your dreams 
 
Bells chime three times, naked dancers enter slowly 
Smoky room, scented gloom, audience eating, fat men drinking 
Candles burn, a dull red light illuminates the breasts of four young girls 
Dancing, prancing, provoking, dreams are always ending far too soon 
 
Life`s too short to be sad, wishing things you`ll never have 
You`re better off not dreaming of the things to come 
Dreams are always ending far too soon 
Sounds of a distant melody, once played, lost from memory 
Funny how it`s clearer now, you`re close to me 
We`ll be together all the time",Winter Wine,1995
Caravan,"This time (this time), I am gonna give you all the lovin' you need (this time),
this time, set your heart free, set your love free (this time).

How can I be at ease when I know soon I'll lay my eyes on you,
I close my eyes imagining the moment that my dreams are gonna come true.
The way you wear your hair, the shyness underneath your smile,
the warmth of your embrace is gonna thrill me in just a little while.
I rushed right in before but right now I'm gonna take my time,
every moment we share I'm gonna savor like a vintage wine.

And when you kiss me (I'm gonna taste my lips) I won't let go,
and when you hold my hand, baby I won't say no 'cause...

Ooh baby I want ya, I can't live without ya no way,
I ain't never gonna love this way again,
no time to pretend, no, no, this time,
I'm so glad I've got another chance, mmm, to love you again,
Oh this time.

I can feel you closer to me, closer as the moment comes,
I thank God for another chance to love that very special one. (Thank you.)
Will he return my love I've held on for so many years,
I close my eyes to cry, then I heard you whisper in my ear...

Ooh baby I want ya (oh I want you), I can't live without ya no way (no way),
I ain't never gonna love this way again (no, no),
no time to pretend, no, no, this time (this time),

This time, I'm gonna give you all the love you need (all the love you need),
set your love free (set your love free, set your heart free),
ooh this time it's gonna be forever.

Happiness I can't explain, inside I have you just for mine,
I'm kissin' your lips, you're lovin' me,
this phrase keeps runnin' through my mind...

I can't live without ya no way (no way),
I ain't never gonna love this way again (never gonna love this way again),

Caravan,"With a song on my mind 
I'm thinking of you 
Through the dreams of a million eyes 
I'll stand still with you 
And wait till I find 
The world that you're searching for 
A cloud-coloured blind 
Has entered my eyes 
And everything's going 
A slight shade of purple 
But me, I don't mind 
Today is my day 
I'm living the life that I choose 
I've found a way
 
I can see a noser 
Sit there all alone 
And dream I'm sitting here 
While magic fires the moon 
I turn around my mind 
And bid farewell to fear 
 
Swimming through a wish 
That I know I'm in a dream 
I'm changing the music by ear 
 
I'll have to leave behind 
To reensure them in 
And wanting oh so clear 
 
Deep insert of time 
I catch my breath to find I've got so far to go 
Howlin' through the trees 
A cry which is my ears 
I turn around and go 
 
Following the dream 
Is not the easiest thing 
Out of the shadows I see 
 
And blackened till the moon 
A magic creature moves 
And says belongs to me",As I Feel I Die,1998

And all the world will sing so big and beautiful
Never know what it is but it goes on

So we're coming with you, we're coming back to fight again
Back with our love for a place in your heart

Count it out, but into yourself, love that's the thing

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Why won't they come and play with me?
Backyard. Tree Fort.
Want to let them in.
But they're not my friends
Sometimes the ash grey mask will suit me fine
The moon is ignored only with the day
The sun is prettiest just before it goes away
Giants in a small world
Forever was just one day
Never really dawned on me
Such short-lived history
Everything I wanted never came
All that I'll become is for another day
Everything I had never stayed
Now the house is so empty
Put me in the chest my ventriloquist
Sometimes living in want is not so bad
Best friend I ever had

Is there something to be said here? Hope you
Realize
Few and Far between are these rocks to hop
So set up shop and get to work
No such thing as a living room
When you sit around.
Streaked a frozen lake just to test testosterone
Message to me (did a world of good)
Lost eleven pounds to the tracks in Ireland
Never bet on the likes of a horse named
Robin Hood
I would give anything to visit History.
Anything to replant History
Oh, to dig for parts of me
Stem to branch-trunk-seed
Caught the theme of just what life's to be
The specters speculate
With their pounding on my head
They're rattling my bed
The slumber sucks you in
I didn't hear from you
And you and you on my birthday
Message to me? (I'm quite the same way)
Building new boats instead of Raising Titanics
What am I trying to say?
We swim or die. We sink or burn
We try and fail (but try)
This message sent to me is that
This picture ain't complete
Run along, live. Don't sit around

I need to find a way home 
Back on the moon to be alone

To run it takes the courage of a lamb
To love, the fierceness of a storm 

Paloma you wonder if you'll miss the thunder
Everyone's staring , but no one is caring for you now
Just spread your wings, latch onto the breeze
Just take the leap... and you're free 

Chase the high ground - where you'd rather be 
Where you might be found 
This move may erase the troubles in your head
Or expose the absence of your soul
And so, it takes some time to get away
And you will have to tear down what remains
And I can't stand for goodbyes
So hold on to me, or lead the way

Paloma you wonder if you'll miss the thunder
Everyone's staring , but no one is caring for you now
Just spread your wings, latch onto the breeze
Just take the leap... and you're free 

Pace yourself when outrunning fear
Take cover when it's dark
And keep an even keel
In your world you're only a phone away
But in my world you're too far to feel
And it may take some time to learn what's real
And you may have to beg and borrow
And you will surely steal
Remember all those lonely sessions
Turned into yesterday's lessons
To never forget love, to never forget love

Paloma you wonder if you'll miss the thunder
Everyone's staring, but no one is caring for you now
Just spread your wings, latch onto the breeze
Just take the leap... and you're free

Paloma you wonder if you'll miss the thunder
Everyone's staring but no one is caring for...
Paloma you cry out you beg for connection
The dreams you seek are straight ahead in every direction
Now you're free
Now that you're, you're free
Now that you're, you're free
You're free

There's no time to cry or grieve
For the fallen family tree

Rise above the flooding plain
Crouching low to dark the flame

Up in smoke, down the drain

Burns the tree and thins the blood
If your tears don't want to dry
I can help you cry

Through the night
Through the night and day
I can't take your pain away
But I can help you cry

Cut the branch from this tree
Carve a place for you and me
Wooden seat that we can string
From a branch where we can swing

We'll take this block of wood
Carve it down, sand it good
When finished it will be
Souvenir of the family tree

And if the fire, if the flood
Burns the tree and thins the blood

But God help me please
Come save the family tree

In the ash, I found an ember
Something warm to help remember
A block of wood that used to be
A strong tall family tree

Blowing in the breeze

And the reasons why,
You smoothed me out.

For showing me how to live.

Can melt these winter bones.

All over napkins on the plane.

Trying hard not to make my space

The wisest change of all,
Any place from here up here
Would be the finest place to fall

On all the time zone lines.
And if I daylight save,
Do I jump ahead or fall behind?

Any plane I ride can fly me home.
And I'm fine 'cause I know.

You know, I know.
It's easy to see,
Clouds were built for dreams,
Because nothing up there
Is as easy as it seems.
I step out and try to walk around,
As I fall, I look up
And wonder why it let me down.

That's twice the speed of sound...

Before I hit the ground.

By an airplane in the sky,

And we would always love to fly.

From shipyard to sea, From factory to sky
From rivet to rifle, from boot camp to battle cry

If red is for Hell

The dead released, with the ship still sailing,
Out of our hands and into the swallowing sea
I felt the crossfire stitching up soldiers
Into a blanket of dead, and as the night grows colder
In a window back home, a Blue Star is traded for Gold.

When metal is churned. And bodies are burned
Victory earned

Long before you were born
Before I bore a son
What good did it do?

Perhaps this paradise is my decline

Riding high on a temporary vibe
Life and love are messy most of the time

If we were sober, we would know that this is real
Beyond a feeling and I'd never let you go
If we were sober we would know that this is real
Beyond a feel, I should have never let you go down to Mexico

We could be drinkin' cheap tequila on the playa Esquinita
And it sure is good to see the sea again
We could be drinking cheap tequila on the playa Esquinita
And it sure is good to see the sea again

We both know what this could be or pretend that it's not happening
Float forever, take a trip with me
Live forever in a postcard where it lives and breathes in blue and green
And roaring up a gentle breeze

We're riding high on a temporary vibe
Life and love are messy most of the time

If we were sober, we would know that this is real
Beyond a feeling and I'd never let you go
If we were sober, we would know that this is real
Beyond a feel, I should have never let you go down to Mexico

We could be drinking cheap tequila on the playa Esquinita
And it sure is good to see the sea again
We should be drinking margaritas in a foreign Buena Vista
And it sure is good to see you once again

Carbon Leaf,"Float from the balcony 
We ride the pine top swells 
Down from the old hotel 
On the lake of Silver Bells 
Leading is lonely 
When you make alone decisions 
Leading is lonely 
When you're dancing through derisions 
So much left for giving 
In the year of living dangerously happy 
On the lake of Silver Bells 

Light flickers by 
A hundred suns behind the trees 
Melts us in a lullaby 
Our eyelids are like movie screens 
And we close our eyes 
And feel the warmth come into frame 
We close our eyes 
Until our dreams become one and the same 
So much left for giving 
In the year of living dangerously happy 
On the lake of Silver Bells 

We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
To muffled chimes out on the lake 
We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
On the lake of Silver Bells 

We've reached a secret place 
To rest and reconcile 
We close our eyes 
The only change is no change for a while 
We'll buy the old hotel 
And we will make this place our own 
And fill each room with sons and daughters 
And never be alone 

We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
To muffled chimes out on the lake 
We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
On the lake of Silver Bells 

Looking passed the love you face 
You miss the place you never had 
But what you need's not just the dream 
But something on the other end 
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. 
You're much too fast asleep

We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
To muffled chimes out on the lake 
We dance across till we drop 
The bells keep time and never stop 
We sleep and we wake 
On the lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells

600 Rolls Royce's and Ferrari's on the PAVEment
Ghetto fabulous, Rolex with the pearl face
Million dollar mansion, imagine livin like Scarface
And then the Feds started watchin me

You know the pain right, you can feel my pain right?

But whoever thought I'd wake up one mornin' with no budget
It's Cardi the golden kid with that older shit
I live, learn, learn to live, the older I get
And I remember Thursdays, hungry Thursdays
'Bout sixteen, seventee, um, Murphy age
But this rap game I love it, it's like I'm married to it
I proposed on Clue?, she said I'd be happy to do it
Gave her a kiss, mmmwwhha, she gave me fifty G's
Silly Cardi I spent it, now Cardi on his knees
Now I'm livin' reality, a Biggie Smalls theme
Askin' for one more chance to show her what I really mean

She said, you done seen a lotta things baby bro'

Whole town love us, no one is above us
Treated you, no talent, knowin' niggas like brothas
No street team, no promotion
Just woof tickets, raw fuckin', no lotion
One year later you decide to drop an Ep
At the same time drop us, that confuse me

So like a bastard child, we on our own
Put out and left alone, why'all won't answer the phone

You ain't got nobody else to blame, nobody but yourself
You know what I'm sayin', mad truth to that

Let me pretend that I'm a lawyer and explain the situation
Facin' three-to-one five across state, humiliation
St. Louis set it off, phone calls was long distance
(Ay yo, it's four birdies in Houston), c'mon, send some one to get 'em

Who would do it for a grand?
Eighteen, only thing on our mind was that killer money
From Missouri to the T-e-x-a-s
Two cats strapped it tight, right up under her chest
One-way trip on Southwest but she didn't make it that far
Metal detectors went bizarre, one-way trip to the car
Your honor, she got a baby that'll drive my granny crazy
A long distance lawyer that keep on tellin' us ""maybe""
And we all raise her baby, takin' care of her daily
This law shit is crazy, never cease to amaze me
It's different from the eighties, ninety-five to lately

Tú no quieres saber na' de mí (uhh, nana)
Dime qu[e fue lo que yo hice mal (dime qué pasó)
Te pusieron en contra de mí (uhh, nana)
Pero es peor pedir perdón que perdonar

Se murió una flor y cambió de color (yeh-ieh)
Tú eras mi diabla, yo te daba calor
Fumando pa' olvidarte, pa' matar el dolor
Y a veces quiero morirme, pero nadie ha muerto de amor

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no, no, no, no, no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (leggo')

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no, no, no, no, no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cuando lo hacíamos
Cuando en la cama nos matábamos

Te dejaste manipular, tú no sabes amar
Tú dices que tú me odias, pero tú no me va' olvidar
Sabes que tus piernas, yo te las pongo a temblar
Yo te devoraba, y tú empezaba' a gritar

Si se mueren, en la muerte traicionan, 
te aman, se van y te odian
Y en la muerte es como la personas que te dejan sola después que te lloran
Hablando con la luna, como un lobo buscando a su loba
Buscando al demonio que te está devorando en su alcoba

Hablándote mal de mí
Como si yo ya me morí
Dile a ese infeliz que te la coma como yo te la comí
Y que te haga mojarte como yo te hice venirte
Tú dijiste que encima 'e mi cuerpo tú más, tú querías morirte, yeh

Sólo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decías nada, nada, no, no

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
""Ya no, no te conozco"", ""hoy 'ta to' bien""
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver

Solita yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer

You ain't cherish shit when you had it
Turn me back to a savage
Grab your stuff while you at it
Now my heart as cold as my Patek, uh

Man, I guess you've been away now
See me on the way up, you on your way down
You had you a ten, but now you a dub
You ain't here, but you wishing you was
You gon' miss grabbing this ass
Now you can miss me with them subs
You don't gotta check on me 'cause I got a check on me
I don't need nothing from nobody, not you especially

And you know that I'm the baddest, Cartier glasses, Fendi fabric
And I'm years away from basic, and I'm miles away from average
But, one thing ain't adding up to me
How you gon' mess with a bitch that look up to me, off

I cannot let up (let up)
Hungry like a Gucci sweater (sweater)
Ain't nobody drippin' wetter (drippin')
I took the time to write a letter (I took the time)
We worked hard out the ghetto
I don't deserve your heart, know you fed up (nah)
We both had a broken heart when we met up
Your body a piece of art, you don't sell it

You know that I miss it, I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone, lookin' how we would kick it (kick it)
Knock at the door, it's a visit
She take that shit off then I fuck in the kitchen (smash)
His and hers, Mr. and Mrs. (hey)
When I talk to her baby girl listens (listen)
I had a dream and you was in it (dream)
When you gone, I feel like I been sinnin'

Come back, come back, come back (come back)
You not really rich, got the bomb pack (bomb)
Dive in the water, have fun with that (dive)
I might put a daughter or son in that (I might)
I bought you a ring and five hundred racks (hey)
She like the triangle Balenci bag (drip)
You know you an angel, come save the bad (angel)
If you really love me then take me back (J Balvin, men)

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
""Ya no, no te conozco"", ""pues 'ta to' bien""
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver

Los dos, sólita yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver

If you need it and I got it you can have it, bitch, I'm sharing
If you cryin' I'ma ask you why you cryin' bitch I'm caring
If you need me to look out for you I'm posted and I'm staring
Thou should never have another boyfriend, I get jealous
Yeah, I’m all 'bout spreadin' love, but I get crazy as a felon

Honestly, don't give a fuck
'Bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes
Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say goals
Bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some Bape
I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face
I'm like okay
I'll let him do what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills
I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me
Their baby father run a bill

Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me
If you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms
These is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both
I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off
Don't get comfortable
Look, I don't dance now

You a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way
You can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts
Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip

This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that li'l bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they niggas is safe

I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like frosted flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott

Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me

Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore y'all get the cost?

They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain

Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it

How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him

Drippin' peppermint schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie holiday
Sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little latasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor store
That she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us

When miles Davis Cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be, chillin' with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be, only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be, chillin' with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky

To see the stars and heaven's journey flashing 'cross the sky

And when the rivers end into the sea

And in your summer and in the air
Have you forgotten how you got us here?

You fail to see beauty through invisible tears
I know what you mean but
Its not what I'm getting at when
I say
'The bits of broken glass
In the evening sun reflection
Look like stars in the night sky
Of the central reservation'

You just say
'That's not how I see it'

Moving through the rain
I hear you here
Say life is a valley of tears
And your heart is a drain
But how can that be the truth when
The storm that came was invited by you?

I say

'The rain is just the moon
She's sending soul in your direction
I hope she softens you soon
With her subliminal affection'

'That's not how I see it'

If all you see is what your eyes see

",How I See It,2001
Carina Round,"So you say we have no future?
As father and daughter;
I wish you could see me in your skin, 
And the hole you left within

But you never stop to see what you begun
Oh lord, look what you've done
The consequences of your slick Italian style
Rumbling beneath the humdrum (?)

And all the seas here will carry a breeze of 
A scent I do not know;
The breath of my father
My sister of another
Bathing the wounds

So you say we have no future?
What with no past either?
But you were never stuck for your excuses;
Just say you remember,
Don't let it slip from your mind.
The girl is on her own...

Would you say my name the way it's meant to be said?
Let it fall from your mouth...?
To see a flicker in my father's eyes,
To feel his breath upon my brow

And all the seas here will carry a breeze of 
A scent I do not know;
The breath of my father,
My sister of another,
Bathing the wounds

Julia, you're here in my fingers.
You seem to flip between my skies;
Sharing the dream of, of a life I will never know.
I will never know...

And all the seas here will carry a breeze of 
A scent I do not know;
The breath of my father,
My sister of another,
Bathing the wounds

Would you say my name the way it's meant to be said?
Let it fall from your mouth,
Let it fall from your hands,
Let it slip from your hips,
Let it slip from your skin,
Let it slip from your mind.
I am knee deep in your blood and you are knee deep in mine...

Every time I take myself. 
Where can I take you? 
Where you won't be there? 

Out of my reach, 
The past hangs bright like 
1800 watt lightbulb, 
Illuminating my mind. 

I just don't know anymore, 
What you're thinking or when you're thinking about it
Would you touch me or would you rather do without it? 

All your life, well do you crave for something more? 
It's high time you opened your eyes, open your eyes... 
All your life, do you crave for something more? 
These dreams, my fears, they disappear, I'm falling free, falling free... 

Passion and desire, 
My heat is rising; 
There's a hungry dog howling 
In the throes of my mind. 

All that's left, anymore 
A heartbeat through our young skin. 
Nothing comes out
And nothing goes in... 

All your life do you crave for something more? 
It's high time you opened your eyes, open your eyes. 
All your life do you crave for something more? 
In dreams my fears, they disappear, failing, falling... 

All your life do you pray for something more? 
Your dreams, my fears they disappear, they disappear, they disappear...
All your life do you crave something more?

Carina Round,"Snipping threads
Images fall clear
Elevation would you find me down here?
I will be waiting for you
Outside of my skin
Falling with the dust of a butterfly's wings
Would you send me a song from the cloud you're on?

Dip into my heart of a vacant season
I would leak my soul to film your ears
Emotion won't you come alive?
I would drag the stars from my own eyes
If you'd send me a song from the cloud you're on.

Always lost in the same sound
Everything comes on the way down
Come around
I'm still waiting for something to take me over.

Measure the weight of your perception, your words and their effect on the resurrection of love and pain and devotion, the child like vision of a lost world in motion...
See through to your star strung gut, reveal the hidden universe no longer deep 'neath the silk chic/a of desert milk skin, now a brilliant libertine, you drift on a carousel of emerald green sheen. I await the forbidden dream, reborn on the weaving words that rise in my throat....
They say I am just the blood that drags from the black cunt of Venus, be spit from a split lip or slip from the slit body of a madman...for the thirst for the thrust for the victory for the thrust for the suck of the breath of a stranger, to with pressed finger map the endless waves of imperial spirit. Influx of sonic impulse. Divine rhythm impulse. Find your divine. Define you divine. Find your divine.

Sometimes I'm so sure I can reach beyond this sky.

Envious, and different in time
What brings you back to me again?
Again, oh
You touched my life this way

You said I was
You said I was beautiful
And then you let everyone touch you
I don't know who

You say

'Don't you know, I'm happy for your sake
Can't you see - it's easier for me?'

Everyone, everyone could tell me it's true
Everyone, everyone but me
What takes you away from me so soon?
So soon, so
You're taking it all away
I don't know you

But you said I was
You said I was beautiful
And then you let everyone touch you
I don't know who

Come down
Down down ribbons
They're falling down
And they're loosening around my neck
And inside bloated seeds silence is you
The sound of beauty's song
A heart broken on jagged edge
A heart broken on your unkempt melody and face
My love, disentangle me
I don't know you
If you see me, unable to see from miles away
The beauty of me

I feel like I could be hanging on your door
I know I'll never have your soul

Your bloodhounds they come around
At the foot of my bed

Dancing on moon beams
His body was shed
And then he said

'You know where you can find me
Always around
I'm lit up and I'm up there
You know where you can find me
Rising your road
I'm lit up and I'm up there'

He said
'Your demons are gradually dissolving
And your virgin is wilder than the waves inside your heart
Stop reaching for what wisdom has no time for
Find your wings girl
Search your spirit'

From my little death woken
Fading rhythm of lifeline
Is music for a dead child
I'm skirting the rim, skirting the rim 
...of reality
Skirting the rim
Love don't pull me in

Somehow everything is broken
Hours past and never replayed
I see the sickness of a love that,
Though it breathes, can never be made

There are cracks where the white light burns through
It seems I see everything but the truth
Once more to that sacred place
The dream that sucks me under

It's freedom to find

Speaking in disguises your words are ornamental
A vapour trail and then you are gone

And I've got a lesson to learn

There's a lot to be 
Said for this morbid self-attention
The problem lies in my external obsession
Animal is hungry been sleeping for far too long
Gonna fill this lacuna somehow

I'm thinking of a man I once knew 
I thought I had the hang of
He never learnt that the heart is perishable without love
But keep your heart out of it now 
Concentrate your vision
I'm lying here like a forfeit awaiting your incision
I don't wanna hear about it

I just wanna leave here wearing a smile

Hanging over Gare do Nord like I never asked for more
Statues on the building tops
Stooping for the fire we got
Heart's new incantation
Your face bared to the sheer moonlight
Time flies and I'm here to ride

Red lights, cars zoom past, New York had a heart attack
Screaming into a new world
Sunrise at Sacre Coeur, I turn to move into the church
Silence wraps around my head like everything I've never said
My heart is reeling, opening to let me in
New day's illumination

Will it rain then and drown this out?
I could die here and never be found out

Sweat freezes on my face
Moving forward from this place
Screaming into a new world

Let it, oh God, let it come

Hair jet black, he'd stars for shoes (?)
Smoked his cigarette 'cause his lips had touched it

He sure knew how to use a hotel room
I could open my hands and let the rain come down
But you're just to close to dream I had
I'm scared, I don't know why I do
But I miss you

He stood there restless, waiting for me
Body hummed with colours I have never seen
So we keep on burning like two stars in the same constellation
Screaming through the air
With a look like the light leaving
He said 'I've known you for a thousand years'

I could open my hands and let the rain come down
But you're just to close to dream I have
I'm scared and I don't know why
I couldn't watch you go
I can't watch you go
You know it sounds strange and untrue

Black straight hair from the tip to hip
Brown eyes blazed under blue eyelashes

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,

Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live

Come on and listen to me

My God! I saw him.
He looked three-quarters dead!
And he was so bad I had to turn my head.
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.

I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

Was clockin' onto you too yeah I had to admit

With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smilin' hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty hearty lookin' tan

You walked towards my path but just brushed right past

Il mare mosso, la calma piatta

Io resto al letto co' 'n filmetto streaming in sub Ita
I Clacson cantano pare che è lo Zecchino d'Oro
Un vinello vuoto digerisce morti di Marlboro, ehi
Speranze dentro un trolley
E noi che ridevamo a crepapelle in un Blue Monday, mo'

Cade giù il soffito e crolla il cielo in questa stanza
Si aprono le acque mentre passa l'ambulanza
Mentre io ti strappo i tatuaggi dalle braccia
La luna è già di schiena e c'è la gente che si affaccia

Ma come mai
Te l'avevo detto mille volte facevi sì
Ma tu non mi ascolti mai
Ti cerco nell'ombra
Sotto questi lampioni rotti
Ma in questa città
Non c'incontriamo mai

Neanche di notte

7:30 e io rimando un'altra sveglia
E tiro su il piumone fin sopra la testa (ah)
Ti ho incrociato mentre stavo in dormiveglia
Ed esco col maglione messo alla rovescia (ah)
E sono al bar e sto impegnato a fare niente
Non ci incontriamo mai, ma io ti cerco sempre ('ndo?)
Al terminal delle partenze
Tra le pieghe del letto
Tra le rughe sul viso della gente
E stiamo immobili
Col sole che ci spia dalle veneziane
Gli occhi rossi pe' i pollini
Svolazza nel vento un foglio di giornale
E ci sporcavamo i panni con la Vinavil
E ci perdevamo dentro questi vicoli
E se mi sporgo dalle scale ho le vertigini
Come fossimo vis-à-vis

Nessuno crede veramente in ciò che fai
Spero che Dio mi tenga lontano dai guai

Ho preso un disco solo per la copertina
Mille messaggi, sempre la stessa faccina
Ma se non usi i social nessuno si fida (ah)
