Stratovarius,"When clouds are covering the sky
I can't help thinking what's behind
In a fading evening
I feel strange thoughts in my mind
What if we aren't alone here
There's a clone of everyone somewhere
That duplicates all that we do
Not like me not like you but our other ego

There ain't no wars or crises
Only joy and compromises
Time has stood still 

Why don't you take me there
Want to feel some infinity
Why don't we just dare
Coz after all remains, eternity 

A landscape with no trees
And a mist arising from the distance
An illusion just for me
Or a proper reward and a chance

There ain't no wars or crises
Only joy and compromises
Time has stood still 

Why don't you take me there
Want to feel some infinity
Why don't we just dare
Coz after all remains, eternity",Eternity,1996
Stratovarius,"If I could stay awake for awhile
It would be another morning
DonÂ´t want to fall asleep now when
Everything seems so far and beyond 

Walking down a familiar road 
But the darkness is misleading me
I know I should feel fear inside
But still the shadows is where I want to be 

Just an ordinary day stealing all the hope away
Wanting me to be the one who has dreams made of clay 

My fading confused mind
Creating phrases unknown 

I know I shouldÂ´t stay awake
If I fall asleep they just might find me
Now all is so clear
I can finally proceed 

Just an ordinary day stealing all the hope away
Wanting me to be the one who has dreams made of clay 

My fading confused mind
Creating phrases unknown 

Waiting for the dawn
Soon to arrive
So few options that I have
And I can use
LifeÂ´s circumstances
Can be so cruel
If I take a chance I just might
Make the wrong move",Night Time Eclipse,1996
Stratovarius,"Learning by trying itÂ´s hard to deny it
While paying for what I used to know
Dreams are deceiving until IÂ´m achieving
The goals I havenÂ´t set too low 

Waiting for a new day
To wipe away the Uncertainty
That flows around me
Once again to stay 

So many choices but so few answers
My time slips away while thinking too much
Whom to believe in theyÂ´re all just repeating
The same old lies so nice to clutch 

Waiting for a new day
To wipe away the Uncertainty 
That flows around me
Once again to stay",Uncertainty,1996
Stratovarius,"Look around there´s no time to waste
Life goes on nothing´s gonna change
Feel the winds of life blowing cold
It won´t take so long you are growing old
There is no answer to be found
It is so easy to fall without a sound

Days of loving and gold
Kept me from feeling so old
Times I´ll always recall
When the night meets the day
Gates of heaven I saw
While flying through the misty dawn
Those days I´ll always recall
When the night meets the day

I don´t want to let you out of my sight
But here I´m lost and alone in the night",When the Night Meets the Day [*],1996
Stratovarius,"I feel like I'm drowning
Trying to catch my breath
Don't know what is happening
There's no sense of time

Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within
Hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you

Can't resist
I don't know why
My life is changing
I cannot recall

Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more
Am I losing my mind

The sun isn't shining
But your eyes light my way
I've found what I've been searching for
My love won't go astray

Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within
Hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you

Can't resist
I don't know why
My life is changing
I cannot recall

Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more
Am I lost

So many years my drifting heart has wandered around
Don't turn on me, won't you stay by my side
Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes

Meaning so much more
Am I losing my mind",The Abyss of Your Eyes,1997
Stratovarius,"Before the summer turns to winter
Before the dreams will turn to snow
I see the yellow leaves are falling
And soon I know I have to go

But I'll be back before the summer
Next year you're in my arms again
The winter breeze will send my message
It will keep you warm until then

The path to home is long and winding
I'll keep the flame alive for you until I am back
You and I will walk that road together
I'll show that all the dreams are true

If you only let them be before the winter
Before the summer turns to winter
Before the dreams will turn to snow
I see the yellow leaves are falling

And soon I know I have to go
The path to home is long and winding
I'll keep the flame alive for you until I am back
You and I will walk that road together

I'll show that all the dreams are true
If you only let them be before the winter",Before the Winter,1997
Stratovarius,"I wake up in the morning
So far away from home
Trying to make it through the day
Many miles are between us
I'm sending my love

From this payphone
Through the storms we've wandered
Many mountains we have climbed
But all the bad times are behind
The road is free, I'm coming home

Without you I am like
A ship without its sails
Calling the wind to save me
I'd climb the highest mountain
I'd cross the seven seas

Just to see you smile again
All the trust that was built along the years
Is coming back to stay
I know, just look ahead
The road is free, I'm coming home

With every stem I'm closer to home
When I'm back you won't be alone
Soon I'll see the familiar door before my eyes
And you
Through the storms we've wandered

Many mountains we have climbed
All the bad times are behind
The road is, the road is free, and I'm coming home",Coming Home,1997
Stratovarius,"I have seen the future of mankind
The wisdom of my prophecies you'll find
Follow the truth, and be careful; are we the last? 
Hundred years has passed; what have we done?
Inconceivable damage under the sun
I think it's too late to change the man - we are the last
The world keeps turning, while people yearn for more
Mother nature is crying for change
The time will come when we all must pay for what we have done
Are you prepared for that?
As we are reaching the end of the century, there's message we can send
Be strong, and bold, and never lose your mind, 'cause we are the last
Signs of the end, I see
Let them hear my voice in every corner of the world
Take heed of the warnings that I give
I have seen the Southern Cross forming in the sky

""There shall be heard in the air the noise of weapons 
And in the same year the divines shall be enemies. 
They shall unjustly put down the holy laws and by thunder and war, 
True believers shall die."" - Nostradamus: Century I V:43-",Visions (Southern Cross),1997
Stratovarius,"These empty days are filling me with pain 
After I left it seems my life is only rain 
My heart is longing to the better times 
When everything was still so fine
I wonder why it happens so fast 
You give your heart away knowing it might not last 
IÂ´m still here waiting for the rain to fall 
And to see you once again

Four thousand rainy nights 
Four thousand nights IÂ´d be with you 
Four thousand rainy nights with you

I keep your memory in my heart 
You give me hope when everything is so dark 
That thing nobody can take away 
Forever in me

Four thousand rainy nights 
Four thousand nights IÂ´d be with you 
Four thousand rainy nights with you",4000 Rainy Nights,1998
Stratovarius,"The setting sun creates another world 
The shadows fall another day is in the end 
The Paradise is sleeping peacefully 
And one more day is again history

Tell me can we go on like this? 
Everybody is living in a bliss 
Are these the last times of our Mother Earth? 
Or is it just beginning of new birth?

Don't be afraid we must be wise 
Patient and peaceful and strong 
Maybe it's like you would throw the dice 
Then hope that nothing goes wrong 
Remember that you have the right to say 
All things that you feel inside 
Open your mind and you open your eyes 
Together now is the time

Sing the anthem of the world 
But will we ever learn 
To control our hate and to forgive 
We must learn to find the way 
To just live another day
And be free like an Eagle in the sky

How about if God just let us down? 
If he just is polishing his crown? 
What's the key to the Universe? 
Is life down here just one big endless curse?

Don't be afraid

Sing the anthem of the world",Anthem of the World,1998
Stratovarius,"Summer's gone a while ago
The daylight dims away
I'm watching here how the snow begins to fall
Yesterday's like a dream
A memory in my head
Like the life's gone behind the winter wall

I'm lighting up the candles and lock the door
Sitting by the fire
It's time to dream some more

I have to find a way how to survive
I am surrounded by the starlight
I have to find the path
and to escape from the Cold Winter Nights

And in the morning there's no trace of the sun
Just gray fog hanging above my head
All the birds are quiet hiding in the woods
Can't see no movement are they all dead?",Cold Winter Nights,1998
Stratovarius,"The times are changing so fast, I wonder how long it lasts. The clock is ticking time is running out. The hatred fills this Earth and for what is worth, we're in the end before we know. 

Throughout the years I have struggled to find the answer that I never knew. It strucked me like a million lightnings and here I am telling to you. 

Every second of day it is coming your way, future unknown is here to stay. Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray. 

There's a time to live, there's a time to die. But no one can't escape the Destiny. 

Look all the things we've done, under the burning sun. Is this the way to carry on? So take a look at yourself and tell me what do you see. A wolf in clothes of the lamb? 

Throughout the years I have struggled to find the answer that I never knew. It strucked me like a million lightnings and here I am telling to you. 

Every second of day it is coming your way, future unknown is here to stay. Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray. 

Let your spirit free, through window of your mind.
Unchain your soul from hate, all you need is faith.
I control my Life, I am the One.
You control your Life but don't forget Your Destiny... 

It's time to say goodbye, I know it will make you cry. You make your destiny. I know you'll find the way. 

And outside the Sun is bright. The things will be allright. I will be back one day to you. So please wait for me",Destiny,1998
Stratovarius,"So long I have been accepting what I've seen, never really speaking my mind. Now the heat's leaking out. I'd like to scream and shout. I want to leave it all behind. 

There's no one else to turn the wheel, I've got my own life to steer. 

No Turning Back, coz I want to know who I am and I want to live my life.
No Turning Back, tomorrow's awaiting, I'm on the way. 

Hard to find the right words and not to make it worse. A choice that has to be done, it is just my life. Can't make no compromise and to stop what has begun. 

There's no one else to turn the wheel, I've got my own life to steer. 

No Turning Back, coz I want to know who I am and I want to live my life.
No Turning Back, tomorrow's awaiting, I'm on the way. 

I have all the strings in my hands. The choices that's been laid for me. I am not taking more commands, coz now finally I'm free",No Turning Back,1998
Stratovarius,"Hunger grows stronger I feel it day by day
I need I desire her passion now
I see that look the shine in her eyes
CanÂ´t let her go sheÂ´s so divine
ThereÂ´s no one who could stop me now
SheÂ´ll be mine

SheÂ´s teasing IÂ´m unfreezing wanting more and more
IÂ´m dreaming just like streaming through the door
I see that look

Playing with fire
Hiding inside the flames
Playing with fire
ItÂ´s a dangerous game",Playing With Fire,1998
Stratovarius,"You found the truth again 
I showed the way 
The Path of Wisdom is the only way to reality 
You learned to live Your life 
The hard way 
Your tears put out the fire from your soul

Lost behind the lies I can hear your cries 
Now is the time to rise again so strong

Learn from your past 
But better make it fast 
The time is running out for you to change your life

You must learn to live 
ThereÂ´s so much to give 
Set Fire to your soul again and be, the Rebel 
Hold your head up proud",Rebel,1998
Stratovarius,"I'm waiting for the rain now, to settle the dusty air. Clearing up my emotions. 
Facing it all if I dare.
I've been thinking, I've been trying but I've always been denying. 
Wasted days are still inside of me, it's time to set them free.

Why don't we see what is going on? 
There are not so many years to be wasted until the damage is done and the beauty is gone.
Save Our Souls.

What is the price that we pay?
Save Our Souls.
Do we have nothing to say?",S.O.S.,1998
Stratovarius,"ItÂ´s 4 in the morning 
IÂ´m gazing the sky with 
Millions of stars 
A moment before the Dawn 
The endless Universe fills me all 
Where are you now? 
Alone just like me and Venus in the morning?

I touch your face thatÂ´s filled with pain 
I kiss away the tears from your eyes 
IÂ´ve waited you for 8000 days 
Now IÂ´ve come here to set you free

But where are you now

Forget the future donÂ´t live the past 
Live for today because life goes too fast 
Go find the Key to your Divine Mind 
Open the Door so many answers youÂ´ll find

Like Venus in the morning",Venus in the Morning,1998
Stratovarius,"Look around do you see 
So many things have changed 
And you should know by now 
I never meant to hurt you at all 
All my life I have been an outcast 
But now IÂ´ve been reborn 
And I see things so clear

Open your eyes and realize 
Hard times are over if you want 
Open your mind 
Reach for the stars 
Answer is there for us to find

Years go by 
Never know when itÂ´s too late 
Years go by 
Yourself you seal your fate 
DonÂ´t look the answer from horizon 
ItÂ´s closer than you think 
Years go by, oh how they go by",Years Go By,1998
Stratovarius,"Once again I try to make things work
Facing all the power of society
Searching all the answers of the life
I´ll never make it on my own

Was I meant to fail every time
Seems to me that's my destiny
Is this all that´s left to me
Confusion and bad memories 

But now my time has come
No more running in the dark
I want much more than this
I really want it all 

Against the wind we run
To every place under the sun
We have got so much power inside
We will never give up
Against the wind we go
Towards the new shore
Together we´ll forget the sorrow
It´s forever gone",Against the Wind,1998
Stratovarius,"Again I see you standing there watching me
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself
There's fascination in the air
I try to fight this strong sensation
But there's no chance to escape from this temptation

Feels like I've known you before
Repeating phrases
But I yearn for something more
I know I can't stay by your side forever
But I know I won't forget your beauty
My black diamond",Black Diamond,1998
Stratovarius,"Went into the plane was scared like hell
Tried to relax for awhile
But when we took off I feared we would fall
Waving goodbye to this life 

I´m flying through winds tonight
No sign of the dawn or light 

Silhouettes in the sky
Wings are carrying me through the night
Silhouettes in the sky
Destination unknown  
Distant Skies 

Then after awhile I tried to sleep
But watched two movies instead
The fear struck again 
How I hate this plane
Hope this would come to an end",Distant Skies,1998
Stratovarius,"Walking down the path that leads me to my memories
Pacing all the way without a care in my stride
Where are the friends of my yesterday
Have they moved on with their lives
Can we still laugh and joke about things like before 
There's no need to hide the past that I have left behind
It's a good resource somewhere for me to find
Why am I waiting for someone to reach out
It should be all up to them
Keeping in touch ain't that easy but I'll have to try 

Where have all the years gone
That's what I am asking now
What have I learnt so far
Tell me Father Time 
Tell me now 

Now I understand I'll take from time what I need
And I store it inside it's there for me to find
I can't deny that the years will pass by
But it won't bother me
Coz now I will set out to realize my dream 

Where have all the years gone
That's what I am asking now
What have I learnt so far
Tell me Father Time
Tell me now",Father Time,1998
Stratovarius,"I stand alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to childhood
To days I still recall 

Oh how happy I was then
There was no sorrow there was no pain
Walking through the green fields
Sunshine in my eyes 

I'm still there everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Will you wait for me forever?",Forever,1998
Stratovarius,"They try to give me answers
To questions I´ve never asked
I'll have no part in their conspiracy
I guess I am the kind of

Guy that will never stray
The thing I need is privacy
Some guiding, depriving
Misleading and combining

They're watching our every move
They can try to bind our arms
But they can't chain our minds or hearts
We will keep our faith inside our souls

And never let it go - we are forever free
You see them making headlines
New pictures tell old stories
Explaining what they have said and done

Media's new illusion
Creating more confusion
But I know that they'll soon be gone
Some guiding, depriving

Misleading and combining
They're watching our every move
They can try to bind our arms
But they can't chain our minds or hearts

We will keep our faith inside our souls
And never let it go - we are forever free",Forever Free,1998
Stratovarius,"I hear footsteps closing in
I recognize them from my early days
The times are different the image remains the same
Repeating backflashes remembering the name

Approaching visions of things I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises
The night awaits

The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas

Haunts me once again
In your private chamber you're all alone
The well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
The flame of the candle casting movement to the wall

Your eyes filled with guilt keep staring at the door
Approaching visions of things I can´t recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises

The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek

The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again",Kiss of Judas,1998
Stratovarius,"Far in the core of the earth
First it was given birth
We heard the call the message was so clear
The tracks were laid for the future to come

Sons and daughters of the Rising Sun
The armies in Europe here we come
We run like the wind we play from the heart
Now we are here together we sing

Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel we're the Legions of the Twilight

We survived the hard times
Never accepted the lies
You run like the wind you sing from the heart
Now that we're here together we'll sing

Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel we're the Legions of the Twilight

When we have to go back home again
We'll keep the memories we gained inside our hearts
Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again

We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel we're the Legions of the Twilight
Raise your hands for us!",Legions,1998
Stratovarius,"Late at night I find myself again
Wondering and watching TV
I can't believe what is on the screen
Something that I wouldn't care to see

Many rare species will perish soon
And we will be short on food
Why do we have to be so selfish
We've got to change our attitude

I know that I am not
The only one that's worried
Why don't we all
Wake up, and realize

Like the birds in the sky
We are flying so high
Without making any kind of sacrifice
We've got so little time

To undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise
It seems to me that there's no sense at all
Nobody cares it's always the same

Mother nature's crying out in pain
We are the ones to blame
I know that I am not
The only one that's worried

Why don't we all
Wake up, and realize
Like the birds in the sky
We are flying so high

Without making anykind of sacrifice
We've got so little time
To undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise",Paradise,1998
Stratovarius,"Season of change life feels so strange
Look into my eyes do you see the truth
I'm lost and alone feelings unknown
Come to me stronger than before

On winds of time my soul will fly
The angels are knocking at my door
Oh now I need to be free
From all this hatred I feel inside

Let it be my dreams
Let it be my thoughts
All those things in my heart
One too many days
One too many years
I wasted for nothing
I never realized
The truth is inside
Of every man for all to see
Listen to me now
I'm so close to you
Never felt like this before

The carousel is spinning fast
Better enjoy while it lasts
Every moment is like gold
You'll remember when you're old
And the meaning of this life
Is to live and is to die
Make the best out of your dreams
They're the world where you are free
All the sorrow and the pain
Will be washed away by rain
An eternal joy will come
It can be found by everyone
Though the end is drawing near
I'm not feeling any fear
I have found the truth inside
After all the tears I've cried

Season of change",Season of Change,1998
Stratovarius,"Today is just an other day
Of my life too short to live
I should have some kind of meaning
A destiny to believe in
Before I go to sleep 

I find some pictures of a time

I will give it all I have inside everything

At the speed of light",Speed of Light,1998

After us the road goes on forever
Many changes lie along the path

That´s the price we pay for our selfishness
We are headed for the end
From the skies shall come the powerful kind
Before and after the Mars reigns at will

Not far from the great age of millennium
Buried ones shall come out of their graves
(Nostradamus: Century X:72,74)
When the comet tears out the sky

After all this the time will come for the chosen ones

Instead so many things for us to attain

The land is green and full of life again
The sorrows wiped away now

To close your eyes
They've seen much pain
It's slowly filling your mind

But now so pale
You better leave all your worries far
Behind

Not long ago when you
Had the Fire
Burning inside of you brighter than any flame
You were the one that I believed in
Keeping our hopes up high where are you now?
Where do you aim?

Let me take you there
To the place you know
Why don't you Dream With Me

Now it is time to open your eyes again
See how all the sorrows have disappeared
Faded away
I am right here waiting for your call
If you still need me to guide your pace

For the young girl who's gone away
She had to return to where she came from
How I wish she would stay, even for one more day

I only knew her a little while
But I'll never forget the time
When we stood on the bridge at the edge of the world
And she asked what was on my mind
Tell me what's on your mind

And I sang a song of sadness 
For the moments forever lost
She had to return to where she came from
Though the seasons have changed 
The loneliness still remains

The cool clear sunshine mornings 
With honey flavored tea 
And the notebooks she kept
On the things that she loved
Were open for me to see
All her secrets for me to see

Wonder if they'll turn black ever
Comtemplating one together

Distorted dreams,

There's no place that can be better
When you're up in clouds forever,
Pacify your mind with islands
Colored snow and green-field skies and,

Poisoned dreams,
Distorted dreams,
Mushroom dreams.

Don't have to tell you it feels better than,
Floating free, walk upon the sand
Got to give you things much better
My mushroom's green and brown forever.

One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you

Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump. bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races

Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

'Cause we came here to set this party off right

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved
The sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return
Of the-the Doc and Shady, no one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels.
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens.
Do do do lookin out my back door


Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?
Doo, doo doo.
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician.

Stray Cats,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Has God on its side. 

Oh the history books tell it 
They tell it so well 
The cavalries charged 
The Indians fell 
The cavalries charged 
The Indians died 
Oh the country was young

Oh the Spanish-American 
War had its day 
And the Civil War too 
Was soon laid away 
And the names of the heroes 
I's made to memorize 
With guns in their hands 
And God on their side. 

Oh the First World War, boys 
It closed out its fate 
The reason for fighting 
I never got straight 
But I learned to accept it 
Accept it with pride 
For you don't count the dead 
When God's on your side. 

When the Second World War 
Came to an end 
We forgave the Germans 
And we were friends 
Though they murdered six million 
In the ovens they fried

All through my whole life

It's them we must fight 
To hate them and fear them 
To run and to hide 
And accept it all bravely 
With God on my side. 

But now we got weapons 
Of the chemical dust 
If fire them we're forced to 
Then fire them we must 
One push of the button 
And a shot the world wide 
And you never ask questions 
When God's on your side. 

In a many dark hour 
I've been thinkin' about this 
That Jesus Christ 
Was betrayed by a kiss 
But I can't think for you 
You'll have to decide 
Whether Judas Iscariot 
Had God on his side. 

So now as I'm leavin' 
I'm weary as Hell 
The confusion I'm feelin' 
Ain't no tongue can tell

What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try, 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme, 
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know 

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

I'll surrender to the simple thought
Of losing everything

When slipping out of reason, she took from me the cause

Of losing everything

Hoping you'd never walk away

I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position

And fade out again and fade out

These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again

[chorus]
We have struggled
We have prayed
We still searching for something more
We have struggled
We still pray
We're looking for the chance... to be free.

Our music is a shout to where we know were not alone
We sing the words of our favorite songs, they bring us home
We find a little comfort, a little peace of mind
Say goodbye to being left out, hello friendlies come on in

[chorus]

Go slow young man
Go slow young girl
Grow strong young man
Grow strong young girl

All of my life I've searched for clarity
I have wrestled with the demons inside me

Chorus

(go slow young man) To break free
(go slow young girl) 'Cause you gatta hold on to your dreams
(go slow young man) It's not as easy as it seems

I can't stop myself.

Until they swallow every last drop of me and you.
I need to learn how to breathe.

We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nuthin'
You made a brother feel like he was something
Thats why I'm with you to this day boo, no frontin'

You would rub me on my back and say baby it'll be O.K.

And I'm a walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids

Motherfuckers halt, when my Colt, start stompin
Thunder, strikes your land with a jolt
Your stamina level is low, like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't die-tect
The infantry, peep the weapon-try as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung
It's the ethics, the rigorous training methods
Of the Abbott, incite overseas to opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates
Breakin down your resistance
Leavin competition defenseless, Masta
Hip-hop antagonizer, dumb deaf and blind civilizer

Anger rap book causin chess blade smoke

Jaw-breaker humanoid vice-grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro, pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in
Sweet action packed rap
Bite it, stomp on a beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status, now, wisdom to the masses

Cock back my tongue like a hammer, my head is like
A nickel-plated bammer, spit forty-five caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull, without penetratin your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu scamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programmin fat tracks at Camp Cristal

Home on the range, rebel with a pen
Writin critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mista, Meth, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my Sex Pistol, deal me in

The bewilderin killa bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta life one fuckin finga
Make sure to God I reef turns on the ringer
We duckin the subpeona
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina

Check the 150 millimeter, heater as it blows holes
Through your fuckin speaker
Makin you weaker creepin inches centimeters
Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Masapeaqua

Things'll never be the same, after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came, for one accord
For one mind and one cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position
You might hear me but you don't listen
Competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleedin, through the paper
Of his sick premeditated, murder caper

I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat em up, cold crush, bumrush
Spot rusher get touched backed up handcuffed
Y'all niggaz can't FUCK with us

Pass me the black velvet embassy suite killin me
Spell it Maxi Priest caught me in the days up on Delancy Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipin Jah, so ha-lo-ha
Pineapple crushed 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spittin off the roof, holdin my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like, stalkin through your airport with a chunky nine

The undervolt Staten New York
Blood sport gun talk holdin fort back, take em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound facedown you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through midair
Landin thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest, for the conquest
Subway, wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase, in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
And shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam, Bigolo
Throw a flow like Nomo relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hangin MC's by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno",Deadly Melody,1997
Street Life,"So get your egg crashed, by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
Left his son to grow, in the ghettoes of the slums
With a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get, P.L.O
By the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep Son every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But eighty-five percent uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
Killer instinct slave rap niggas get lynched

So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slow footed penguins, duckin from these
Hot rocks that's flamin, chocolate for all you rap Damian's
Spraying cards ex-pionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
And a mink in, next album ""Blood on Chef Apron""
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a FUCK swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbin a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladjé

Ha ha ha ha, yo
What you know about this, specialist armed dangerous
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split all your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the Force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bit the mic sayanora
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword cross your throat you joke

We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsin the sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your matress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm goin in
Shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then, still can't get no satisfaction
Once again, back on the block crumb snatchin
Blowin backs in cold
Blunted non-assassin, time for action, Johnny Unitas
Handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas

Drownin problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Gettin boosted off of killer bee pollen
Stone columns get trapped by drum tracks mac loud as gun claps
Pin a crab nigga to death of a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu Sensai fold, it bees the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The fig newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber trainin new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
When bullets scream from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
(""Sometimes..."") Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block cause them blood to gush
From digital to analog, the Wu-Wear camoflogue
The entourage squad we stompin through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connectin Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows

Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleama
Lex graffiti name Ramo, hold em we rollin
Askin me though, raps is hotter than, hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passin off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with a axe, Maxamill
You could crash a meal, got you back steel
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyein y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spittin fire out
Verb burgular, design the Wally shoe store reserve
A jet status, Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose inside a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Stylin rich, RZA made the waves in one chain
Feelin mics like, wheelin a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right
We movin on it like, wind breaker niggas get they face broke

Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's 

So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield 

On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still 

never follow beef hey beef follow me 

want to settle in the court I say settle in the streets 

like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it 

Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it 

I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute 

Stash my dough secure the funds of profit 

[Prodigy] 

Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time 

Fuckin with my niggaz, extraordinary line swishin 

your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit 

Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this 

Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song 

Doin this for too long, to not come strong 

You're only a pawn of Viet Dong 

Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born 

Secluded on a distant farm 

This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 

Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 

Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch 

It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck.. 

Chorus One 

Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready 

for a war here, fuck peace, what?

Deadly Melody part two 
That's my word 
It ain't safe no more, no more bitch 

Yo yo 
Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal 
Hour of assassination be upon you 
Moving with the tiger strike  bound  gagged and shot 
The head in  (not sure of this verse) 
East remains hot with police 
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions 
Observe the magnetic attraction 

And its time for some grid 

Iron rap, action-packed grudge match 
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno 
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard 
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O 
Plus like a calico, tally ho 
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo, 
Stole-a-might, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?) 
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights 

Sight beyond sight, late night, city light 
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like 
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant 
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty 
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin 
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence 
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains 

It ain't nothing like hip-hop music 
You like it cause you choose it 
Most D.J.'s won't refuse it 
A lot of sucka M.C.'s misuse it 
Don't think that Wu can't lose it 
Too much to gain you'll abuse it 
The name of the game is rapture 
This one is completely captured bass 
 
Yo 
I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts 
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks 
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo 
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro 
Galico, throw verse, we slide my dough first 
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk 
From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow 
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno 
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees 
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task 
S-I-N-why, and what, had a gut 
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous 
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets 
Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus 
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous 
Criminal minded killas rust 
I intend to build a fortifying man, 
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick 

Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act 
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap 
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical 
Slide up in your worth casual 
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra 
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable 
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers 
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers 
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting 
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales 
John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo 
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through my beige window 

Spazz Spazzola Ola

Lock your door 
Crack your jaws

Street Life,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

Yo, when we do this, we do it for real
We do it for the love, we do it for the money
For the cash, for the women, the birds
We do it for the foundation, for the people
No matter how we do it, we do it for The Cause
Yea, yo

What you die for? I hope its for The Cause

What you work for? What you stand for?
What you strive for? I hope its for The Cause

[Inspectah Deck]
Inspectah, rhyme beretta nine in ya sector
Wet the scenery with extreme measures
Supreme lecture, bless the heads, you dare enter
The 9th Chamber, dance with the mind bender
Surrender your thrown, there's no room for pretenders
Bystander pollyin worldwide with nine members
Distributin, my verbal sharp shootin
While I execute the deadliest moves with fine tunin
Duel of the Iron Mic bound to spark fusion
Movin at the speed of light, nice at what I'm doin
Drop it in ya brain like spice, without the five mics
Heads roll off hilltops when I strike
Sniper aim, stick you up for your price of fame
Like the flame, watch you get hot inside the game
Recognize my name, I.N.S., your highness
I rep for live sets, place ya bets, make ya threats
There's no cure, even the experts are stunned
My work is done as soon as I've just begun *echo*

[Chorus]
[Streetlife]
Strictly, Streetlife, I never play a fan of the fame
Just build on my name, and master the slang
I'm hittin harder than a lot of artists in the game
I'm lyrically inclined, rockin just the same
Than any MC who ship platinum or gold
And only recoup to pay back what you sold
Over budget your video, got pimped like a hoe
My niggas move slo-mo like robotic clones
I'd rather be alive and paid, than dead broke
My life is like a thin line, on a tight rope
A fiend with no dope, wrong way to provoke
The man behind the scope, tucked, ready to smoke
>From the same place you from, different hood, the same slum
Mother's third seed, father's first son
Bastard child runnin wild, livin foul
Ran into some juvenile niggas in design
P.L.O. Style, sign my name on the dotten line
Your beef is mine, dangerous minds combine, we all carry nines *echo*

[Chorus]
[Inspectah Deck]
Hitman like Thomas Hurns, bustin while the weed burns
Shorty, sixteen, yearns for my crew to take turns
I'm a loose cannon, medically examined
Found deadly as a plague, soon to spread like famine
Splurgin, livin out the dirty version
Throwin rocks at the ghetto birds circlin the urban
Workin overtime, you notice the shine
Niggas scope mine, models won't work Capone nine

[Streetlife]
We travel in pairs, you got the front, I watch the rear
Got money on my mind this year, by all means
Put an end to your cold stairs, crush your small dreams
What you hear is the truth, fuck what you used to
I provide you with street music you can ride to
Push through, sound blastin through the sun roof
Street surfer, lurkin, thirsty for the loot
I'm in it to fuck fans and rock mic stands
I work for cash and fans, and die for the Clan",The Cause,1999

Yo, what's poppin' off out here son?
Yo, hold up, I think that's my baby mama on the phone
Damn, yo, hold on, yo hold on for a second
Yo, man, you see shorty right there (look at shorty right there)
Yo, I'mma call you back in a second, aight?

[Streetlife]
Yo, excuse me Miss Thang with your nose ring
The way your body swing, you make a nigga wanna sing
I can tell by the bling-bling, you like the finer things
And you highly motivated by what money brings
You got a dope fetish, attitude to go get it
A little athletic, no need for cosmetics
A little bowlegged, street smarts and good credit
You got the best part, that's why you actin' hard headed
It's a man's world, baby girl, don't forget it
But what's a thug without his ladybug, I must respect it
I know a woman's worth, ladies come first
I'm the Sun, you're the Earth, mother of the universe
I know what you like, you go for the street type
Who keep the g tight, and hit the G-spot right
I just might, call my wife
Tell her ""Baby, I'm not comin' home tonight""

Yeah, checkin' baby girl with the wavy curls
Precious lady pearl in the shady world
Please to meet you, your dress fit as if see through
Niggas treat you like royalty and dream to freak you
Diva in your own right, keep your home right
Bad bitch with the switch, let's trip the strobe lights
Tight with the Power-you, I'll devour you
Everything about you, make me scout you
No doubt, boo, make me fiend for a taste
Your hot like a fireplace, shows in your face
Now, come out the closet, baby girl, it's safe
Just a taste, of sex, lies and videotape
Let's skate, but late on the way, sound clever
Drinkin' brown leather, she down for whatever
We he call tomorrow, that's the question asked
Call it love at first sight, til the next one pass like

[Chorus]

[Streetlife]
Look at shorty right there, with the six-pack
Lookin' like a fruit snack with the shoe strapped to her knee caps

[Inspectah Deck]
Look at shorty right there in the blue Range
With the two bangs, high in the eye, she's a true dame

[Streetlife]
Nah, look at shorty right there, with the mini skirt
With pink finky shirt, the way her body jerk make my jimmy hurt

[Inspectah Deck]
Nah, shorty right there, the amazon
Six foot three, with the glasses on, built for a marathon

Look at shorty right there with the big hips (where?)
With the group of chicks, aiyo, lady who ya'll rollin' wit?

To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all n***** is p****, so is the d*** that sent you

And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive and still the sun'll come out tomorrow

And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bulls***, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya n***** know what's on my mind

May the caviar pate you were eating
Block your airway
May your manservant deliver
The Heimlich, with honor
May this make you vomit on your Dolche govana
May your wife's worried face show her horrific expression
May you realize she's not worried, that's just Botox injections
May all the commotion cause to crash the chandelier
? Shock diamonds from their beards
May your Ferrari break down
May your chauffeur get high
And smash up your stretch rose?
Up bermodeo drive
Off the breaking backs of others
Where you got all your bucks
Till we make the revolution I just hope your life sucks

May your pino be sour
May that white stuff you snort be 96% flour
May the famous rapper you bring
To your daughter's sweet sixteen

May the death squads you hire be bad with instructions,
And instead be at your mansion with the street sweepers bustin'
May this make your parties get ?
Dive behind the chimney all cryin' and cussin'

Street Sweeper Social Club,"And the wealth don't trickle down
People pinchin every nickel now
Even if we don't fight
Bodies hit the ground
I spit the sound
Of a million fists finna pound
I'm in the crowd til this whole thing switch
Around
Our brains are on temporary disconnect
I shoot my mouth off
I can't find my pistol yet
You can call this music disrespect
'cause I'll slap you in your face at your local
Disco tech
Mr Green with your missiles and rockets
My paycheck burns a hole in your pocket
You told the judge put my name on the
Docket

Let's fight

Let's win
We gon fight
We gon smash
Let us in

If it don't work, we gon do it again

Your honor may it please the court
Swear me in on a book full of Tupac
Quotes
After what I say
You might noose my throat
Reporters please scribble down a few
Hot notes
Allow me to be the first
To throw dirt on their graves
Excuse me
I never learned to behave
My great great granny was a Carolina
Slave
She wispers in my ear
Sayin ""Spark the blaze.""
Somewhere on the eastside of steal and rob
A whole generation got a McJob
And the light bill still ain't resolved
See the hungry mob pulse and throb
If you got a blacklist I wanna be on it*
If we gon attack this then we need to run it
If you see my hood man
You might call it ghetto
Politicians are puppets y'all
Let's get Gepetto

Let's fight
Let's smash
Let's win
We gon fight
We gon smash
Let us in
Let's fight
Let's smash
Let's win
Just like getting up in the club with a fake ID
If it don't work, we gon do it again

Well it's a matter of fact that I'm gonna
Die one day
But muthafucka
Right now I breath
And I may not be able to predict my
Demise
But you can bet it won't be on my knees
I'm rappin at the speed of the falling dollar
They got greed to make you crawl and
Holla
It's old school like Easy-E's impala
Ay! Ay!
You gon lead
Or smoke trees and follow?

Let's fight
Let's smash
Let's win
We gon fight
We gon smash
Let us in

And I'm tangled in sheets
It creeps between my eyelids
Seems the blinds sprung a leak
Pills crushed in wine are a headache sometimes
But not 'til the feelings worn off
Still the sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm not getting up
There's nothing like a beautiful morning
No there's nothing like a beautiful day
No there's nothing like a beautiful morning
To make me hate the way I hate myself today
The sun hangs over Sunday
I pull the blankets over my head
And it creeps between the stitches
I melt like wax in my bed
There was someone here last night
Before I closed my eyes
She's just a scent on the sheets
Still the sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm gettin' the fuck back to sleep
The sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm hung over as well
The sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm hung over as hell

Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)

Never lost to emcee's as lame as why'all
Never, trick a bitch car payment off

Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam to sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me""

Say, ""Yo, Meth, fuck it, throw a Jim Brownski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be""
Them Billie Jean shits and they real Rocky

I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch

Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!""
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make y'all wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me in your studio

Half baked, eatin' ganja cake

You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands

With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels

I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam

Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years

And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly

The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted

Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow

Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound

A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics

I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular

To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation

Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy

Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from

Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives

Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

[Chorus]

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor, coming from the RZA

Your middle finger up at the light, I'm nice
Doc ride or die, I bubble up when the pouring peroxide
It's dirty, lookie here
Still sharp like I'm back in school
It's like Wonder Blade, cut a nigga smooth
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, who let the dog loose?
Whips and chains, I don't wanna argue
The big whale that's writing fishscale
Like me, better believe, I'm too hard to harpoon
My goons, think like Chris Wallace
'Give me the loot' and I don't wanna talk about it

Crush the building, how about that?

Kicks crazy, jewelry is bonkers
Whether in the club or you see me in concert
I go hard, who created a monster?

First of all, my royalty come quarterly
My hoes, my niggas, all move accordingly

My foreign exchange, but always in the capitol
Straight cash advances, while you be calling
Your label all day, hoping someone answers
I flow with no auto-tone, just me and my bitch
My blunt, my beat, my microphone
I shine with no jewelry on, another star is born
Watch me perform, beyond the norm

If you nasty, I shoot 'em with penicilen, you heard?
I'm like Cali, so carry, when I'm flipping the words
Flip the script on your bitch ass while I'm flipping the bird
Meth sick with the pen, stick a few in your men

Homicide Housing, that's what I represent

Last raid, another fed paid, bed rum: Sunday
The world dyin' for the love of money
Expensive chains, intensive pain from that cocaine
Condition the brain, children in strain, as I look back
Memory lane, civil and plain, it be in fame
A major part of the game, chemistry grain
Foolish kids ran when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain
Spark right through my vein tunnel, aim through this jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang
But watch me bang as in Eagle/Crane
Step back, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system where he barely sustained
Forkin' in, I sold a million way, his first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, nigga
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, then I be top of your list

We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever, yeah, yeah
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever

Check the Words from the Genius, that was written in pen
Murder gloves, hide the fingerprint, but never the sin
Ghetto prophet that's born to quote
Got the crimies, behind me, with the face on stroke
Don't provoke, trust son, that thing bust, and we roll dangerous
Who can handle us, when we rush the clubs on thrust
Yo, don't miss the lead vocalist, terrorist
Wu-Tang, a pure danger, the God hold a fort
Teach law, universal, beat down, my stomping ground
We hold courts in the streets of New York
Snort the gun powder, eyes stay red like fire
Cut the mic wire, hit a love ballad note
Pen stroke, beautiful quote, for you to deep throat
Ghetto life had to rough up in the housing
They only make 'em us, every twenty five thousand

To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire

And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out

Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass

In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw

P.O.'s violate your dirty urine

I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in

I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""

Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul

That's my word

Hour of assassination be upon you 
Moving with the tiger strike  bound  gagged and shot 
The head in  (not sure of this verse) 
East remains hot with police 
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions 
Observe the magnetic attraction 

And its time for some grid 

Iron rap, action-packed grudge match 
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno 
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard 
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O 
Plus like a calico, tally ho 
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo, 
Stole-a-might, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?) 
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights 

Sight beyond sight, late night, city light 
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like 
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant 
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty 
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin 
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence 
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains

Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks 
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo 
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro 
Galico, throw verse, we slide my dough first 
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk 
From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow 
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno 
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees 
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task 
S-I-N-why, and what, had a gut 
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous 
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets 
Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus 
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous 
Criminal minded killas rust 
I intend to build a fortifying man, 
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick

Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap 
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical 
Slide up in your worth casual 
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra 
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable 
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers 
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers 
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting 
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales 
John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo 
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through my beige window

Streetlife,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane

You’ll always remain the same

Welcome to the meth lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, back 'til you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
'Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
'Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you lie, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So at your court hearin', judge show me some leniency
Can't escape old havoc, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your car seat, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

Eat shit and die slow, battle ground no survival
You goin down, y'all niggaz fuck around
Shittin where you sleepin, so my rhyme Proposal came Indecent
Beef from the butcher, sink your teeth in

Fuck what you believe in, you real-fake
Fishin in the same lake, eatin off the same cake you blow face

Who go that ready cook, synthetic look, actin crook
Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
Your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized by his un Alikeness
Knowledge is the truth and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands
Observe the black sands in the hourglass, fallin fast
In the savage land haulin ass, Days of Thunder
It's Road Rage, your days are numbered
What RZA put together let no man tear asunder (motherfucker!)

This is P.L.O., Killa Hill flow but you don't hear me though
Live in stereo, pumpin loud until your speaker blow
Ghetty-o slang pro, sling rap for cash flow
Keep it live from the intro until the outro

Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check

Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all niggaz goin down

I'm on a suicide run, y'all niggaz know the outcome
Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar, ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Reservoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13
Professionals wit no things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the P.J.
To Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon
Hood rhymes that's be-yond ya thinkin
For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds
Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy n*gga
Rag time, bad sign, flatline

I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent 

About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event 

It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville 

Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill? 

Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase 

Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's

Doin this for too long, to not come strong 

You're only a pawn of Viet Dong

Secluded on a distant farm 

This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 

Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 

Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch

Deadly Melody part two 
That's my word 
It ain't safe no more, no more bitch 

Yo yo 
Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal 
Hour of assassination be upon you 
Moving with the tiger strike  bound  gagged and shot 
The head in  (not sure of this verse) 
East remains hot with police 
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions 
Observe the magnetic attraction 

And its time for some grid 

Iron rap, action-packed grudge match 
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno 
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard 
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O 
Plus like a calico, tally ho 
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo, 
Stole-a-might, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?) 
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights 

Sight beyond sight, late night, city light 
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like 
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant 
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty 
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin 
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence 
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains 

It ain't nothing like hip-hop music 
You like it cause you choose it 
Most D.J.'s won't refuse it 
A lot of sucka M.C.'s misuse it 
Don't think that Wu can't lose it 
Too much to gain you'll abuse it 
The name of the game is rapture 
This one is completely captured bass 
 
Yo 
I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts 
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks 
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo 
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro 
Galico, throw verse, we slide my dough first 
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk 
From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow 
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno 
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees 
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task 
S-I-N-why, and what, had a gut 
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous 
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets 
Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus 
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous 
Criminal minded killas rust 
I intend to build a fortifying man, 
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick 

Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act 
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap 
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical 
Slide up in your worth casual 
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra 
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable 
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers 
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers 
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting 
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales 
John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo 
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through my beige window

Streetlife,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

It's the synical, lyrical rap individual
On my death bed I spit sick flows that's critical
I'm not a fan of this, I'm a mic vandalist
Thug therapist, my clan's too original
My slang bang to wax, words that's visual
Too digital for y'all common street criminals
Who want to come test, lick the sweat from my genitals
We can get off the mic and get a little physical
I was born to rock since they cut my umbilical
Cord, I swing swords, behold the prolifical
Rhyme writer, hip-hop provider, prize fighter
Live wire, quick to set the mic on fire
I speak legalized dope, hitman for hire
I quote murderous notes, dope rhyme supplier
Hang glide on the mic like a stunt driver
And I won't stop rockin till I retire

Yo yo yo
When it comes to the darts, I throw em
Flamethrower, blow your section-eight home to your payphone up
Grass smoker, in the cut for the lawnmower
I water, I ride the wale that ate Jonah
Over, your faced wit the black cape over
You woke up four gorillas wit a makeover
Packin a punch, asthma pump takeover
My crew boards, and the whole plane lays over
You can't talk wit the tape over
Pass the pussy, get out, date's over
Back to your gray Nova that's way slower
Redline to five on the highway shoulder
Enemies say ""Doc the one to play closer""
This baboon loose off the chain choker
Hardcore, jacore I hate poker
But y'all spread when my bullet's daytona

Comin through, comin through duck, run for cover

Yo yo this ain't ya granddaddy music, it's hip hop
Comin through your woofer like a mute kit
Hundred-thousand watts on some bullshit
I blackout eclipse wit the semi bust a full clip 
Touch one if any, that's my complexing conquest
Now tell that shit to the court, I plead no contest
From none of y'all, please
I potty train pissy-ass rugrat for free
Keep the cake for the family and off Sarah Lee
That's how we do, powerful, movin on ya left!
Mista who, Meth, black gorilla, beatin on his chest
I suggest, you pay yo' debt or Protect Ya Neck
I suggest, you wear a vest makin all them threats
Here's a chin check that cash and splash niggas in half
Smash rappers like hash (smoke em down to ashes)
At last it's the crew that party crashes the masses
Madness wildin out like special ed classes

Straight out the gate, meet Tony
Don of all dons, behind New York King Tut wit one arm
Been at nutcrunch last cinnamon toast wit power rose
Whips dirty, dustin my bitch, FUCK PAROLE!
Peace shout he's Wallee Timb's, wild out (wild out)

Came out his mask it was Ollie North
Oh shit, what up what up Ghost
Congratulations on your new flick
Burn it dead who max the most
Word up you got the most Clarks

All emcee's falled when I heard the albums droppin'
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it

The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear Sean John and Phat Farm up
I never gotta Soul Train award
Never lost to emcee's as lame as why'all
Never, trick a bitch car payment off

Lets trick the night fantastic
I'm flexable, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on why'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like nobody used to wizz
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the clan and you know the fuckin' man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin' in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin' down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith & Weston
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F it be flexin'
As hard as my erection, kid learn your lesson
'cause what if I decide to start testin' the joint in the muthafuckin session?

[Saukrates]
Let a nigga get into it
Lubricate why'all veins with your ""Do-It"" fluid
I Einstein these rymes, spit these thangs to prove it
Cross with the mac, in fact my games are truest
Now I'm on the highway, doing it my way
With Street the legal, Meth, Roc, and Doc friday
Performin' like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin' out a prescription
With diciton, they in thick, when I put fire to the stakes
And burn the arch, like a iron to your face

Look out! Big 'Sauks is here, hit the button",Enjoy da Ride,2001
Streetlife,"Yeah, six o'clock in the morning
That's right, we gotta get this darts right
Spray y'all niggas on some marksman shit

Yes, I said, ""Look, I got ready to graze
Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam to sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me""

Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three
Say, ""Yo, Meth, fuck it, throw a Jim Brownski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be""
Them Billie Jean shits and they real Rocky
The fans can't knock me
I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch

Once I took off the hoodie, revealed the face
Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!""
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make y'all wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me in your studio

Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands
",Silent,2002
Streetlife,"I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

It's the funk Doctor Spock smokin' Buddha on a train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize, Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick

Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on till the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed we got a fuckin' O
Check it, I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screamin' for the antiseptic
Movin on your left kid, and I'm methted, out my fuckin' dome piece
Plus I got no love for the beast
Hailin' from the big East Coast
Where niggaz pack toast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats
[Hey boy, you's the rude boy on the block
You try and stop the bum rush you will get popped]
As I run around with a racist
My style was born in the fifty staircases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and glocks in ya
Enter the centa, lyrics bang like rico-chet
Rabbit, I brings havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smif'n'Wes
Punks take a sip and test
Who split your vest
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama
Just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with, or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes, I love those Section A Bit-ches
Hittin' switches, twistin' wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga,
Boo, scared you, blew you to smithe-reens
Fuck the marines, I got machines
To light the spliff, and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya five times like US Air off an instrumental
Look I'm not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks em up proppa
Ask Biggie Smalls 'Who Shot Ya'

Look, I got the tools like Rickle

This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed, motherfucker

Welcome to the meth lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, back 'til you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
'Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
'Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you lie, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So at your court hearin', judge show me some leniency
Can't escape old havoc, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your car seat, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

Another weak day comes along,
And all my righteousness goes wrong.
But I was doing so well;
My dreams to be a Godly man
Seem out of reach of my own hand,
But where I fall short, His grace still stands,
If I have faith like a child.

And if Monday's child is fair of face,
And Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Then you can call me Tuesday's child.
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe,
And Thursday's child I've got far to go,
But you can call me Tuesday's child.
Sounds too easy some might say,
There's a bigger price to pay;
But when Jesus have His life away,
It was once and for all.
So with more of His grace filling me,
I more than ever want to be
Growing up in purity,
With the faith of a child.

That's what I want to be,
Full of His grace for me,
Knowing He's all I need.

Stretch,"I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep; share it with me!

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker; who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me; what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family; what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club!
Got my mind on danger; never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessey, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase them down
Like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble everyday in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches, ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passing me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's looking lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back, yo; give 'em slack, yo
And now they label me the mack, yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get your ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you're on, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin', yo, there's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, ready to get my slug on
And I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't looking when I'm blastin'
I'm a nut, and drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why, ‘cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother I'm trapped, I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain

Stretch Armstrong,"A lot of brothers out there been
Flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality

We been doin' all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

Well what you want me to do?

Express yourself!

I'm expressin with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flava, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube; because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat; and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm droppin english
Even if Yella, makes it acapella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nnothin'
But makin a sucka and you equal
Don't be another sequel

Whoa!
Express Yourself

Now, gettin back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Whatch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' or guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear Stretch Arm Strong say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to express yourself!

Whoa!
Express yourself

Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it (a big part of it)

Expression is a big part of it, a big part of it!

There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, Stretch Arm Strong is the lynch mob!
Yes I'm a climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage
Or I'm a be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're gettin' hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

Express yourself!
Whoa

Come on and do it
Come on and do it

Will I measure up?
What am I supposed to do?
I've never felt this way
These are my darkest days 
I feel so far away
Away!
A life of perfection
Constant reflection of what I'll never be
Smothered by your love
Safe in your embrace
Unending devotion
The memory of your face now I know
Now I know me
So, I'm reaching out and I'm hold on
And I'm trying things I had left behind

Stretch Armstrong,"Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand
Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand?
I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now
Where'd you come from? Where am I going?
Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for...

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

Every night these silhouettes appear above my head
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper
Every time I fall asleep Every time I dream
""Did you come? Would you lie?
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for...

Waiting for you""
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything
I'll only stand here

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

The kids are here they're by our side.
So light the torch we're on the way.
All together, let me hear you say.
Everywhere around the world, every boy and every girl.
It's in our blood, it's in our soul.
No matter your age.
Many wonder why.
Few will ever understand.

Stretch Armstrong,"A lot of brothers out there been
Flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality

We been doin' all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

Well what you want me to do?

Express yourself!

I'm expressin with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flava, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube; because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat; and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm droppin english
Even if Yella, makes it acapella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nnothin'
But makin a sucka and you equal
Don't be another sequel

Whoa!
Express Yourself

Now, gettin back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Whatch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' or guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear Stretch Arm Strong say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to express yourself!

Whoa!
Express yourself

Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it (a big part of it)

Expression is a big part of it, a big part of it!

There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, Stretch Arm Strong is the lynch mob!
Yes I'm a climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage
Or I'm a be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're gettin' hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

Stretch Armstrong,"Dig deep inside my mind I know I can't forget you.
Reality and rawness I find, I know this is truth.
Stripped of all my pretense I feel so lost and naked.
With your tenderness for love I can make it.
Confusion, fear consume my thoughts the things I say and do.
It's all so difficult because I'm not with you.
I know that (I'm not growing) ,

Pieces of life scattered all around
The art of politicians spread their
Canvas all over town
Thick lines of red
All the lies and promises
The images won't leave their minds
The witnesses can't leave it all behind

Hearts on fire burning hot
Searching for more blood to feed them
With their desire they'd rather not look 
For peace while their hatred's breeding 

Destroy! Rebuild!
It won't bring it back
All the life we've killed!

Back through time in and out of days
Fragmented lives seem to waste away
The monsters have once again made their mark
They paint with thick lines of red
All the lies and promises
The images won't leave their mind
The witnesses can't leave it all behind

Hearts on fire burning hot
Searching for more blood to feed them
With their desire they'd rather not look 
For peace while their hatred's breeding
And this will never end until their weapons melt
And we will never see or fell what they felt

We've got the numbers but we're running out of time
One voice united we echo through these lines
We've got the numbers

But tonight we had it all

I will draw the line like I have one thousand times before

I want to run away, I gotta get away
Can we find a better way?

Right now, right here
This is our last resort, but the air is clearing
The situation is too tough to report but the outcome is still pending

And my desire to erase these memories from my mind
So I lie here waiting for the right time
Could it be the right time to turn and walk away

I've been up three long days and we've covered a million miles.
Or so it seems
My face is cracking from all the fears and miles,
My trials and all my dreams
And I know why I live this way
My energy left me, it's back today
Sacrifice my body and mind
Because this is our time.

So many dreams stretched over these endless miles
So many faces and places we left with endless smiles
But buried deep within our souls
The inability to let go

So many dreams stretched over these endless miles
So many faces and places we left behind

I've been up three long days and we've covered a million miles

Sacrifice my body and mind
Because this is our time

So let's pack it up and gas it up
We'll give this one more try
And answer this burning question that's consumed us all the while
We'll give it everything we've got and if this ends today
We'll know that we gave it our best shot

And I know how it feels to be battered and frayed
And since we're all still here, I'm glad that I stayed

And tonight we'll make this ours

And so I'll pack my things and I'll wipe your crying eyes once again
It hurts to chase this dream but I'll follow this one through to the end

What, Silky Don Entertainment
That nigga Strick, Royce the 5'9''
Rock-A-Block all day, what yo yo yo
I'm the type to show up to the studio

Write that shit, spit it, hit it, leave ya'll askin ""Who dat?""
I'm the next nigga to boom, I assumed ya'll already knew that
Hip hop's hottest new cat, lay your crew flat
Have your label faxin my label askin ""Why ya'll have to do that?""

It's a true fact, when you rap, the crowd boo that
And more than a few cats agree you shouldn't even do rap
What you recorded, screw that, buy a new DAT
Your girl's a true rat, so when I fucked her I wore two hats

So move back you little newjack
'Fore you fuck around and do some shit that get not only you
But your whole crew whacked
Too strong and I'm too black

And pack not one but two gats
And I'ma aim em at you black, true dat

Strick,"Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, 'cause I know shit ain't really like that
'Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout ""Strick, I'll be right back!""
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Made 'cause I stack more, and what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell am I sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some bound to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I don't came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart feces, get it? Dumb shit
Couldn't give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: ""Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em""
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say hi to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fly wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
Atleast go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
'Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
And bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit 'cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down 'cause they ain't sign me first
So let me stop right now 'cause I know y'all niggas be dieing to be writing my verse

[Chorus]
If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve at night to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!

If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you seen them things then blow ya horn
'Cause if ya not there's something wrong!

I came outta rap training camp as a reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'till I see my name and my face on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, ????, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'ma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'till I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish it was O.J and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I pack bigger
Just ask your wife, 'cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back on for my birthday
I'ma do another video, too explicit to play

Ace, Zee, yo Strick, Bricks, Zee, Outsidaz, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Niggas fear me like the fear of Aids
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braides
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably apin' in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared at jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we re-modeled the spot
That's why y'all cats be spittin' that shit from em
See you grinnin' when I stop and the rims keep spinnin'
Fuck with Zee I'll bash ya face
I'll fucks wit' Masta Ace, bitch",Something's Wrong,2001
Strick,"I'm startin' to think that my skill is a waste
Still in the race with an ice grille on my face
Mad at the world, mad at you, mad at my girl
Mad at my friends and anybody drivin' a Benz
I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail
But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail
I hate my neighbors, they always askin' for late night favors
Hate indie labels, especially hate majors
I don't give a fuck no more, fuck this tour
Fuck these shows and these groupies, they all ho's
Hate these rude people stayin' all in my face
And hate the fact that Visa always callin' my place
So all you mean creditors and magazine editors
Same ones that debted us and put niggaz ahead of us
I'm a mad dog who sits in the dark
I'm fixin' to bark watchin' 106 And Park
What a mess, I guess I'm sorta stressed
Turn on the radio and I get more depressed
No wonder I'm kinda bitter
Strick told me I should quit player hating, but fuck that I'm not a quitter
Had a few cats betray me, try to play me
Bail and try to blame me, fuck you pay me
If y'all could, y'all would finish me
That's why this finger here is for everybody in the industry

When you tryin' to hustle for pay and people get in your way
That's when you ready to say ""Fuck all y'all""
When the job is givin' ya hell and pay is minimum scale
That's when you ready to yell ""Fuck all y'all""
When it's really starting to seem that people killing your dream
That's when you ready to scream ""Fuck all y'all""
I'm talkin' to you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm talking to you nigga

Yo I'm simply trying to eat ‘til my belly is fat
And I rest in the Midwest where R. Kelly and Nelly be at
Where my name ring bells like ""Who's celly is that?""
And ""Yo Strick you about to blow!"" yo stop telling me that
'Cause at the end of the day I'm still just a nobody
'Cause nobody knows me no record label chose me
But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me
A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky
A huge debt, three lawyers, and two managers
A bullshit advance that didn't recoup the damages
A couple of singles that wasn't really chartin'
Yo Ace I got a Cherokee! ""Bow Wow got an Aston Martin""
That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool
A rec room with many games and plenty women too
He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin' hot tub
I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs
Speakin' of nots yo, I'm not a happy camper
Not gettin' no younger, feeling like a grandpa
Yo I got low self esteem
Just like a nigga running in place tryin' to chase his own selfish dream
And fuck my girl, soon I'll be startin' to creep
She's a slob and don't care if her carpet is neat
She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak
And can't cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep
I got a dog that don't bark and cat that don't meow
Everybody else is rich and I don't fuckin' see how
Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up
Should just end it and give back the spot I'm takin' up

When you tryin' to hustle for pay and people get in your way
That's when you ready to say ""Fuck all y'all""
When the job is givin' ya hell and pay is minimum scale

They stole the mic I grip 
Now that it's gone (what's wrong?) 
I'm feelin tired and sick (How did they do it?) 
I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long 
When I woke up (what happened brother?) 
My microphone was gone 
At first i panicked (how?) I put the cops on the case 
But they were stuck (damm?) Without a clue or a trace 
So sure as smokin cigarettes is bad for your health 
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself 
So I picked up the phone (for what?) 
I called Dizzy 

What's up? 
My mic is gone 

Word? 
Let's get busy 
Before I could tell Dizzy What I wanted to do 
He was over at my house with the TMS crew 
He said 

Word is out in every mouth 
In the street now that your mic is gone 
It's not long until your beat 
And then it hit me (Damm) 
I got a battle at six 
Without my microphone I'm guaranteed to get whipped 
You might think it's unbelievable but word to the strength 
when it comes to rockin' rhymes I'm a musical nymph 
They gave me other mics but yo it wasn't no use 
I tried to rock One two one two 
But I couldn't get loose I said forget it 
My microphone or not I gotta do it 
Give it all that I go (What if you loose?) It be the first time I lost 
But if I beat em I'll finally prove I'm the boss 
I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets 
Suckers was hopin' and preyin' Strictly Dope would get beat 
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight 
Yo I was confident that I'd win 
To hell with the mic 
I hopped up to the stage Dizzy started the beat 
suckers shivered cause he Tasted defeat 
Then I signalled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme off my head 
Perpetrator fell back (Huh?) And then he was dead 
I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that night 
Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic
