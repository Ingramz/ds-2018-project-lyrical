Rick Trevino,"Maybe the juke box can heal up a heartache
But I'd go into debt
Maybe the whiskey can wipe out a memory
But it only hurts my head
Maybe some dancing will pick me up
But the best songs always ends 
Now I'm down and telling myself 
Time is a fools best friend.

[Chorus:]
Doctor time, have mercy on me
Don't wait too long to set me free
Doctor time, I'm counting on you 
Cause your the only one 
Who can pull me through

Friends tell me hard work can fill up the hours
But it don't fill this bed
A quarter says a phone call can bring forgiveness
She'd hang up again
Gotta find something to forget her
Everytime I lay down
There ain't a night goes by I don't wish
I'd wake up a year from now

[Chorus:]
Doctor time, have mercy on me
Don't wait too long to set me free
Doctor time, I'm counting on you 
Cause your the only one 
Who can pull me through

Time tell the truth your the only one I trust
How many weeks until I leave this heartache in the dust

[Chorus:]
Doctor time, have mercy on me
Don't wait too long to set me free
Doctor time, I'm counting on you 
Cause your the only one 
Who can pull me through",Doctor Time,1994
Rick Trevino,"When I was a baby, my sweet momma told me
Go around this world and see all that you can see
Find a good woman, get a job and settle down
But I could not stay away from the lights of town
I had to go where the music is loud
I fell in with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd

There's was debutante in Dallas, that nearly blew my mind
She was raised on caviar and real fine wine
She didn't like hillbilly music and that was more than I could take
I left that lovely little cowgirl waiting in the Lonestar state
'Cause I had to go where the music is loud
I'm right at home with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
'Cause I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd ",Honky Tonk Crowd,1994
Rick Trevino,"Oh you won't see me smile again no not for a while
'Cause way down here on lonely street there's heartaches by the mile
I try to hold my head up and forget about the past
But my heart recalls and the teardrops fall
'Til I break down and laugh

Oh I cried, cried, cried when you left me
Oh I tried, tried, tried to forget your memory
But when I see your photograph it tears my heart in half
And it only hurts me baby when I laugh

I think I'm going crazy look what you've done to me
A victim of your reckless ways is all I've come to be
The jukebox in the corner knows excatly what to play
Singing the blues and born to lose while I laugh the hurt away

Oh I cried, cried, cried when you left me
Oh I tried, tried, tried to forget your memory
But when I see your photograph it tears my heart in half
And it only hurts me baby when I laugh

And when I see your photograph it tears my heart in half
And it only hurts me baby when I laugh
Yes it only hurts me baby when I laugh
",It Only Hurts When I Laugh,1994
Rick Trevino,"You've got me wrapped around your finger 
Like a yo-yo on a string
Playing games with my heart
And I can't do a thing
Well you throw me down than you snap 
Me up I'm in the palm of your hand
Why you get your kicks doin' 
All these tricks I'll never understand

You give me just enough rope, just enough hope
Just enough ties that bind
Just enough love but not enough 
Off security or piece of mind
You give me just enough slack then 
You yank me back right before I'm gone
You give me just enough rope
Just enough hope to keep me hangin' on

Well you tell me that you love me 
Then you push me away
How you're gonna treat me changes day to day
Well you build me up then you tear me down 
And when you've got me standing tall
You pull the rug out from under me just to watch me fall

You give me just enough rope
Just enough hope, just enough ties that bind
Just enough love but not enough 
Off security or piece of mind
You give me just enough slack then 
You yank me back right before I'm gone
You give me just enough rope
Just enough hope to keep me hangin' on

You give me just enough rope
Just enough hope, just enough ties that bind
Just enough love but not enough 
Off security or piece of mind
You give me just enough slack then 
You yank me back right before I'm gone
You give me just enough rope
Just enough hope to keep me hangin' on",Just Enough Rope,1994

Que bonito fue,

fuimos un par

why llenos de amor,

un momento alla


No existia el bien

ni tampoco el mal,

nada mas tu why yo

why un momento alla


Refran


Dias sin fin,

noches tambien,

amor asi, nomas uno en

la vida

Entregare

todo me ser

por un momento alla


Te siento temblar,

Es porque te vas?

O piensas quedarte

un momento mas?


La luz es amor,

no se acabara

Logramos brillar

un momento alla


Dias sin fin,

noches tambien,

amor asi, nomas uno en

la vida

Entregare

todo me ser

por un momento alla


Por un momento alla

                                    And when she talks about the pain

                                     And she says that I'm to blame

                                       You can bet I did my part

                                   If she says I didn't lift a hand when

                                          she walked away

                                    It's true I didn't make her stay, but

                                      How it hurt to watch her go

                                 There's a million things that she might say

Rick Trevino,"Hello heartache, I thought you'd be here
Why don't you and loneliness go grab yourself a beer
Misery loves company, that's why I knew he'd come
We're havin' us a family reunion

How ya doin', must have been years
I didn't see you guys at all, the whole time she was here
Let's break out the bottle, the party's just begun
We're havin' us a family reunion

Here comes ole mister teardrops
And look there's uncle blues
On and on with sister faded love
In my cup of mornin' blues

Hello sadness, you finally came around
She filled my life with love and I guess you were outta town
Come on in the gangs all here, I can't say it's been fun
But we're havin' us a family reunion

Looks like another big old broken hearted
No guests have yet departed
Can't stop once you get started
Kinda family reunion",Family Reunion,1995
Rick Trevino,"My friends think I'm crazy that I'm working too hard
But they don't see these memories that haunt me in the dark
Since you went and left me since you broke my heart
Baby I ain't playing with a full deck of cards

The lights are on but there's nobody home
The heartaches are here but the love is all gone
I'm out of my mind I'm no longer in charge
I'm no longer playing with a full deck of cards

I should have seen it coming but it caught me off guard
That joker came and ran off with my queen of hearts
I'm playing solitaire now and the cards are all marked
Tonight I ain't playing with a full deck of cards

[Chorus: x2]
The lights are on but there's nobody home
The heartaches are here but the love is all gone
You're out of my life but you're still in my heart
Tonight I ain't playing with a full deck of cards

Tonight I ain't playing with a full deck of cards",Full Deck of Cards,1995
Rick Trevino,"I like the old ones and I like 'em new
Everything about them fits my attitude
No matter where they're going or where they're from
I like to watch 'em go by, each and every one

I see them on the roads, out in the parking lots
They're purring in my ear, showing me what they've got
I've never wanted anything so much
I've got to have one - I want a girl in a pick-up truck

Power steering, gun rack, spare tire in the back
Goose neck trailer hitch, four-wheel drive
Son-of-a-muddy-ditch wouldn't slow her down
She'd be too tough, man, I want a pick-up truck

I sure am lonesome sittin' all alone
Just waitin' for someone to come and take me home
I guess some guys have all the luck
To have a girl by their side ridin' home in her pick-up truck

Power windows, granny gear, tool box in the rear
Four-barrel dual wheels, king cab cowboy
Carryin' automobile, I'd put the windows down
Turn the radio up, man, I want a girl in a pick-up truck
",I Want a Girl in a Pick-Up Truck,1995
Rick Trevino,"When I was young I was frightened by shadow monsters on my walls
I was convinced they would get me in the dark if I slept at all
I knew she was there in her bedroom, so I'd tiptoe down the hall
Lay my head on the floor and try to see under her door

[Chorus]
I was looking for the light
When it was on, I knew everything was all right
Before I could knock she'd open the door,
and I'd look up and see that smile

She always knew when I was looking for the light
At 19 I had all the answers, thought I could make it on my own
As we were packing she said,
""Don't ever forget, this is always your home""

Soon I found a one room apartment
Has monsters of it's own
So sometimes late at night I'd drive by that old house

[Chorus]

I stood there filled with fear, as she was passing away
They said, ""She can't hear you now, all we can do is pray.""
As I squeezed her hand, she opened her eyes
Smiled for me one last time
She always knew
When I was looking for the light",Looking for the Light,1995
Rick Trevino,"Hello old friend it´s me again
I´ve had a change of prayers
I´ve learned that love´s not meant to be
When only one heart cares

Hiding all these tears I cry
Is like holding back the rain
Lonely days and scary nights
Only amplity the pain

Chorus
I know that she´s gone forever
That´s something that nothing can change
I´m not asking for a miracle
Just help me Lord
To live with the pain

I´ve heard that time´s a healer
Only time will tell
I´m a true believer
You can lead me from this hell

Can move mountains apart

Rick Trevino,"Oh you, poor, broke, mixed up mess of a heart
You let a little bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times but you wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up mess of a heart

Yeah, I watched her buy a ticket in Charlotte, North Carolina
I heard her say, ""One way please to Denver""
She's goin' to meet that other guy, it won't do us no good to cry
'Cause she's wearin' his ring on her finger

Oh you, poor, broke, mixed up mess of a heart
You let a little bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times but you wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up mess of a heart

I watched her tip the porter as she stepped aboard
That midnight train bound to take her faraway forever
And I watched the tail light fade away knowing she was gone to stray
And now I wish that's broken heart was leavin' with her

Oh you, poor, broke, mixed up mess of a heart
You let a little bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times but you wouldn't listen or pay me no mind

That's exactly how I found her
I wasn't lookin' for her
But how could I ignore her
There wasn't no way around her

She was singin' like she just got saved
And wavin' her hands toward heaven
I saw the light that night as I was 
A-comin' out the door of the Seven-Eleven
With a bag of chips and some bean dip
Down in Memphis, Tennessee
And I said, ""Good Lord, if you're gonna save this one
Save this one for me.""

She was so good lookin' and I just stood there lookin'
Oh, I guess it must a been five minutes

There to greet a working man when his day is done

I'm savin' a place for you in this heart of mine
By way, anyhow, what's wrong with right now

It's hard to have faith
When so many dreams
Somehow lose their way
The path isn't narrow
It turns and it twists
But I knew my future
The first time we kissed

But God as my witness
You can be sure
This heart you're holding
Will always be yours

But it ain't gonna take all the memories I've got of

[Chorus]",Bobbie Ann Mason,1996
Rick Trevino,"When I was a young boy I could play any song
From rock & roll to country, I could play all night long
Grandpa would tell me, play that Rose of San Antone
And I´d just smile in my youth & say I´d learn it later on

Chorus
Here´s my San Antonio rose to you
The song you wanted me to learn for you
Whatever you go, this song´s for you
Here´s my San Antonio rose, & it goes out to you

Maybe I thought Grandpa would be around forever
It never crossed my mind how fast he could go
Soon I grew much older and so did he
Suddenly I realized how fast we grow old

Chorus

The day Grandpa left us was a day I can´t forget
Never did I learn his song
So if you´re listening from up above keep those
Tears from my eyes
And let me know that I´ve touched you so
High in the sky

Rick Trevino,"He sends her flowers right out of the blue
Calls her up at work to say I'm missin' you

I wish he wasn't so good with a tender touch
I wish just once he'd forget 
How lucky he was finding that girl
But he never does, and just for myself
I wish he wouldn't treat her that way

I guess that I should be happy for her

He tells her how she hung the moon and the stars
Then counts them for her every night while she's in his arms

Rick Trevino,"I sat at a table and wrote a good song
About eyes as blue as the sea
Drank down the whisky
And let out a sigh
And thought of how things used to be
Children played on the floor near the bar
With toys made of wood and string
Lovers kissed and others laughed
As the band would strum and sing

Habla me Rio de Tenampa
Canta me canciones de valor
En este rincón del cielo
Dejo mi cariño y amor

And I passed once a place we'd go
To escape the heat of the day
Tell all the stories of good times and bad
And hear the violins play

Habla me Rio de Tenampa
Canta me canciones de valor
En este rincón del cielo
Dejo mi cariño y amor

Remember the story about a lady on the hill
Gave roses to an Indian boy
Ran down to tell everyone he knew
About his love and his hope and joy

Rain now falls on a plaza in town
At a fountain where mariachis sing
I wonder how long these memories would last
And dream what tomorrow would bring

But you'd always see him with her at the store.
She was never much for football.
She'd sit there and pretend she wasn't bored

You saw one you saw the other.
Like a two lane Texas highway straight and true.
But just over that horizon the road that they were riding split in two.

Separate ways, his and hers
A love that went from great to good to bad to worse
Separate lives, what a waste
The last thing they ever did together was go their separate ways

It really scares me baby.
How easily that good love slipped away.
Let's remember that forever is something that we should work at everyday.
And after all those years together, it killed me when I saw their love go bad.

So let's hold on to each other and don't end up like my mother and my dad.

Separate ways his and hers.
A love that went from great to good to bad to worse.
Separate lives what a waste.

Why should we spend money
On a show or two

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2008

Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise

How can the wind with its arms all around me

Rick Wakeman,"I awoke this morning
Love laid me down by a river.
Drifting I turned on upstream
Bound for my forgiver.
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.
Sound did silence me
Leaving no trace.
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.

He spoke of lands not far
Or lands they were in his mind.
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time.
In no time at all he took me to the gate.
In haste I quickly checked the time.
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.
Had to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing your wonderous stories.
Hearing your wonderous stories.
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there to stand
So cautiously at first and then so high.
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories.
Return to hear your wonderous stories.

Rick Wakeman,"The tension is there in the hall as they stand
Soon the dancing will start
To square old Syd Watter's band
Anticipation is calm, mainly under the arm
As they wait for the dancing to start

Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
There's a plumber from Hackney with a hooker from Bow
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
What once held up high I'm afraid now hangs down low

The costumes are strange just like the people inside
Some men four foot six tall, some women four foot six wide
Still the floor's reinforced for the onslaught to come
As they wait for the dancing to start

Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
Yes they glide round the floor just like hippos in snow
Quick,quick,slow,slow,quick
Here's the Irish contestants, yes it's Doreen and Mick

They each have a number so it's easy to spot
Those who can tango and those who cannot
With their arms in the air and their legs wide apart
They prepare for the dancing to start

Good lord a couple out there are really having a go
He's turned upside down, their bodies now intertwined
What's their number, ay yes, sixty-nine

And Doris there who makes all her own clothes
Unfortunately it's Sydney who's wearing them

Formation teams in a line
Some full of hope and some full of wine
You know the reason why they're there more or less
And their idol's dress

And our solo tenor saxophonist has done for music
What Walt Disney has done for blue movies
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow


Everyone's eyes are on the big silver cup
Come in number seven, 'cos your time is up
It must please one couple out there on their own
'Cos everyone else has gone home

Rick Wakeman,"He's an aging man without a future plan
He was a star but now they've all forgot
Now he just lives in the past, he's just a blast from the past
Our aging star has lost the plot

Well he spends every day in salubrious bars
Dreaming that he's still a star
He's got a big enough gut to string a thousand guitars
Wow!

He writes songs all year wich no one wants to hear
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star
He's got no record deal, he's got no modern feel
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

There's more grooves on his face than on his latest LP
Which the music press just shot down in flames
He's musically dead for all the world to see
Wow !

He grumble he was as big as Jimi Hendrix
Now the only thing that grumbles is his grumbling appendix
Lots of children he's got, well he was on the road a lot
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star
Now the groupies ain't  there...and nor is his hair
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

He cries in his sleep but there is no one to hear
He once used to have the ears of the world
Now there is no one around to care for one single tear
Wow !

Now there is no one around who wants to hear his new sound
That he hoped would shoot him back to fame
Now he's dying inside as well as dying outside
A talent that has turned to shame

Rock and roll ghost, rock and roll ghost
Ghost of a rock and roll star

So he's fading away, getting dimmer each day
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

Rock and roll ghost, rock and roll ghost
Ghost of a rock and roll star

So he's leaving my friend, career at its end
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

Rock and roll ghost, rock and roll ghost
Ghost of a rock and roll star

They find him one day, at last passed away
To the rock and roll heaven afar
So at last without risk, there's a psthumous disc
By the ghost of a rock and roll star

We used to laugh that we were poor
And then it left us
We left each other
We let each other take it away

And so we laughed and cried
Watched as each other died

Which maybe I can be me

Climbing up your ladder I keep falling down

Sword from this stone
And anvil, is the true-
Born king of all Britain

Upon a New Year's day
A host of knights did pray
That from the anvil one could draw the sword.
As each knight took his turn
They found the anvil, held it firm;
None worthy of a future king and lord.
Sir Kay the bravest knight
Appeared to try his might
He dreamed of being king, as all the rest
To Arthur Sir Kay called to search
And bring for him a sword
In earnest Arthur set about his quest.
A churchyard in the wood
The sword and anvil stood
And Arthur drew the sword out of the stone
The anvil now defeated
His quest for the sword completed
A sword that was to place him on the throne
A sword that was to place him on the throne.
Sir Hector and Sir Kay saw the sword
And knelt to pray
Then gently took it from young Arthur's hand
They marveled at his quest
Proclaiming to the rest
Arthur is the king of all this land
Arthur the king of all this land.",Arthur [Live],1992

Rick Wakeman,"Write the rules for the games we play
Carved in stone for a future time
Broken pieces thrown away
Broken pieces that are mine

Hope in words so nearly true
Peaceful times are long unseen
Promises I give to you
Only I know what they mean

Charter for a freedom lost
Made by man who knows not why
Leaving youth to count the cost
They only suffer times gone by

It would never be the same
If ruler lived beyond his past
He would have to live his game
And speed of truth is never fast

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The scream of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

And so
Time moves on
A war
Waged in words
With Kings and Church and common man
But no winner
Or beginner
Can understand the battle plan

But the battle never lasts long
Even though it is an old song
And the singer never sings the same old verse
Turn the melody to war chant
Change the flowers into warplants
Kill them all
Just to swell the purse

Pray to the Father
Peace ever after
Only love
Up above
Glory to the war



So for peace we wage a war
As in war we fight for peace
Death to all, be rich or poor
Comes in such a bloody feast

Will they meet in a future time?
Will it happen yet again?
Only God knows the truth they say
Only He is ahead of our time

Where is the charter made for love?
Where is the charter for killing war?
Sadly hidden in the warrior's glove
Making light for ever more

Magna Charter shows a path
Over which no truth can stray
Floating as a neutral craft along its way

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The screams of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

Rick Wakeman,"Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.
The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise
Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle
Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""
The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving down to the depths in a single motion
Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light
Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream
Brownish hue dictates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere
Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age

Can burn a way into a lost,
Icy cold heart
Change at will
And melt man into man
And turn his head slowly to love
Slowly to love

A Queen for a King
To give the touch of a young
Young woman to sing
Love to the people
But when she's not there
How soon the heart hardens to stone

But what of the man engulfed in love?
But for just brief moments in time
Lost in space with eyes everywhere
My friends
That is the story of love

And if you want to
I can tell you of the pain to follow
And of the innocent
And not the guilty who will suffer
But you won't listen
As the person we are talking to is you

Hey, calm down, main man
No longer are you in control
Bow down to the power of love
A never ending starring role

Queen of hearts
The heart is king
No-one wants to be the clown
A deep breath for the power of love
As the walls come tumbling down

But the man still fights
For the right to be King of England
To lord over all
With a rod of iron and steel
But caught in the trap of love by chance
Nobody gives him a second glance
Not a nice way to get caught
Within the turning wheel
Hear love squeal

Fire coming out
With every single word that's said
With the force of the source that's working
In the secret passage of your head
So sail away
Golden day
So that love can paint the hate clouds red

There's a main frame above
That's the mainstay of our love
(If you ever want to go and find it)
Our love is the right term
For looking for a right turn towards love
(If you ever need to find it)

The man with the arrows is firing at you and me
No good diving
He can fire at land or sea
Attack
Launch
Fire
Fire
Fire your love
Fire your love at the plan
Turn him out
Burn him out
To the passion of a molten fire
Hold on
Release now
I said now, now, now, now, now!


A King for a Queen
A Queen for a King
A song built of love
A love meant to sing

A heart now sold
A heart now won
A heart on fire
A love as one

And if you want to
I can tell you of the pain to follow
And of the innocent
And not the guilty who will suffer
But you won't listen
As the person we are talking to is 
The person living inside you

Lure the Black Knight from his lair
Fight and kill the evil man
Rid his evil from our land.

Knowing to save the waste land he must fight
Eager to kill all those who came his way
He must stay
He must fight

Struck Lancelot with fearsome force.

Then struck the Black Knight to the ground
Leapt from his horse and then he smote
A single thrust and pierced his throat.

Guide me by truth laid down by Arthur's hand

Sword from this stone
And anvil, is the true

That from the anvil one could draw the sword.
As each knight took his turn
They found the anvil, held it firm;
None worthy of a future king and lord.
Sir Kay the bravest knight
Appeared to try his might
He dreamed of being king, as all the rest
To Arthur Sir Kay called to search
And bring for him a sword
In earnest Arthur set about his quest.

The sword and anvil stood
And Arthur drew the sword out of the stone
The anvil now defeated
His quest for the sword completed
A sword that was to place him on the throne
A sword that was to place him on the throne.
Sir Hector and Sir Kay saw the sword
And knelt to pray

Rick Wakeman,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

So pack your rusty razor
And don't bother with goodbye
Your cup runneth open
But mine is always dry

[Chorus]
Standing room only
But I can't stand no more
Standing room only
Outside my door

Don't help me set the table
Cause now there's one less place
I won't lay mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the street
Me, I'll read a good book
Turn out the lights and go to sleep

Struck foot most far before us
His birds and beasts supply our feast

Be the best knight in the world.",Merlin the Magician [DVD],2008
Rick Wakeman,"The hillside was a patchwork quilt 
Neatly stitched with tidy hedge 
And crumbling grey stone wall 
The trees were bare, but Spring was near 
To conjure up its endless strings 
Of green magic handkerchieves 

Could you only see what I've seen 
You would surely know what I mean 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven. 

A string of diamonds formed a stream 
That tumbled down the daunting cliff 
To sparkle bright on the beach. 

New born lambs that sweetly played 
Speckled eggs all newly laid 
But for you I would have stayed 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven

Yeah, you know I never felt
Let's make our tortured Romeo's
Personal health can be beat
You bring it on yourself
Burn out when you might peak
The Holy Ghost is exiled from your heart and from your soul
If you control it it's no fun, and if it's fun you've lost control
Your past is plagiarism
yous symbols have dried up
Your corruption's as confused
As old lovers that you've dumped
Like some hidden toxic fume
Your soul dissipates
It's the ozone of guilty acts
Eroded by all the things you hate
There's bodies dancing, crazed
Sexual heat
Grazing from the orchard where starving people eat
Her great weight overwhelms, at times bodies fall
Bankrupt from the beaten
Let's split one more eight-ball
Blue as beggars, beaten, bleeding
Tired eyes made of rust
And we all know when it gets like this there's no one you can trust
No no there's no one you can trust
No no there's no one you can trust
No no there's no one you can trust
No no there's no one you can trust
Some say the solution's locked in the sweat-box
I wouldn't know
I've never been there, I sold my keys to get a ride
We sing along to forgotten AM radio stations
And drink expensive wine, toast the friends that we left hanging
Like prisoners in conceit
We hurry through the cracks
I know for sure don't trust no one who says' they've got you back
The windows all explode
Outside the noise pollution blooms
Everyone's now hidden like cockroaches in dark rooms
I've been brought back from the dead before, so anything can happen
Obsessed with tragic [unintelligible, 5 syllables] like Eric Clapton
These are my wild years, I'm trying to enjoy the pain
The euphoria of dying
Toxins wrestle in my brain
We've all been leaves of corruption
We've all been spiders on the wall
Waiting for a hand to smash us or the bloom of light to fall
Is this guilt of just self-hatred
Only wild, uncontained
Leaking from a broken soul
Is this creation or a stain
Is this creation or a stain
Is this creation or a stain
Is this creation or a stain
Is this creation of a stain",Creation or a Stain,2000

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Now they're on their way
Dashing through the snow
To St. John's, here we go

Well, it could be a boy
But it's okay if he's girl

The things that we give

We should move to the west side
They still believe in things
That give a kid half a chance

When he pulled off the road
Step in a waltz of ted moon-beams
Said he fit an APB,
A robbery nearby

And he go for his wallet
And they thought he was going for a gun
And the cops blew Bird away

The far side of the tracks
Lolitas playing dominoes and poker
Behind their daddy's shacks

On a pearl splashing glass

If they come up on our ass
We'll just give 'em the go-by

That you wear like a switchblade on a chain around your neck

Now its daddy on the booze
And Brando on the ice
Now it's Dean in the doorway
With one more way he can't play this scene twice
So you drug her down every drag of this forbidden fit of love
And you told her to stand tall whet you kissed her
But that's not where you were thinking...
How could a Natalie Wood not get sucked into a scene so custom tucked?
How now look who shows up
In the same place
In this case
I think it's better

Once Johnny the King made a spit ring
And all the skid kids saw a very, very proud man
And he entwine her in his finger
And she lay there like a baby in his hand
And climb upon the rooftop docks lookin' out on the crosstown seas
And he wraps his jacket across her shoulders
And he falls and hugs and holds her on his knees
But a sailor just takes a broad down to the dark end of the fair
To turn her into a tattoo
That will whisper
Into the back of Johnny's black hair
And now Johnny the King walks these streets without her in the rain
Lookin' for a leather jacket
And a girl who wrote her name forever
A promise that -
We belong together
We belong together

Shall we weigh along these streets
Young lions on the lam?
Are the signs you hid deep in your heart
All left on neon for them?
Who are foolish
Who are victim
Of the sailors and the ducky boys who would
Move into your eyes and lips and
Every tear
That falls down on the neighborhood now
I said ""Bird, we just gotta tell them""
And they turn and ignore us
And the only heroes we got left
Are written right before us
And the only angel who sees us now
Watches through each other's eyes
And I can hear him
In every footstep's passing sigh
He goes crazy these nights
Watching heartbeats go by...
And they wisper -
We belong together

Far above in heaven a bird flys through the terrible cloud of unknowing
Trust can make a man into a wood, trust can make a man green

An everything that longs to Be
Broken and small enough to see
To be held in his hands
To be a part and yet alone

Here he is, reaching for the sound of forgiveness
Now wounding 'round the waterfront she listens for a voice
A sign of Mother God, a sign of God the lad

Try to lighten up, want to back you up
But you just back down

Julie got some brown girlfriend, got it for a coin
Landlord threw her clothes out on the street in the tenderloin
Everybody's been a dog, everybody's had to beg everybody's been a moth,
Been a moth, when she woke up on her knees, everybody made her say please

I was in a wild place where I go, I couldn't hear you
Julie found god in a bus station and she liked it a lot
You put your money in the basket that comes, you remember the first one that you bought
Everybody starts out pure, starts out ridiculous, starts out beautiful nobody wants to be alone

Out here I'm all on my own

A little boy named Howard, everybody knows one of those guys in school who kills everything he finds,
Every little cat, every mouse, every dog, likes to burn his sister with cigarettes

Green life teems up from the underground
Glows in the dark, sifts the sands of garbage
Reach hard in for the ragged star fish

And only her lipstick bleeds,
And the color seeds into all your paint by number schemes
What was yellow, what was white, what was day, what was night
And now in soft detective voices the past rises

And follows you in shapes of rain and dew
And you walk through the fun house,
Those sonic faces hit you like a bus
'Till you're knocked down by the doppler waves of trust

And over here I scare myself day after day,
Cube after cube, dot after dot laying down on the kitchen floor,
Tapped into the secret code she's a down girl,

The altered universe, step right up
Door swings both ways and now tattooed children, two-legged potions
Follow us while lightening bugs circle overhead,

Chasing us across summer and into sleep
It's down rain, down time, she's a real down girl,

Been on a train north, baby did you hear the whistle blow?
I saw a man, take a needle full of hard drug and die slow

There's a bright light in the north wind, gonna bring you home
Mister there's a bright light in the north wind, it's gonna bring you home

No, no, damn you Mister and I dragged him out the door

We can't always walk in the sun 
I've come to show you another way 
Around
Weaving a home
From patterns of sound

We catch marvelous moments
Put them down, put them down
Ah don't I recall
All of us flying
On parachutes in fall
Into the wind
To all stars again

There

Ricky Bell,"When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while

Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

[Chorus]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl, understand me
You will always be my candy girl

While you sucked caramel apple lollipops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that want to socialize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the temperature was high as could be
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled, I remember all that

[Chorus]

(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

[Chorus]

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat

And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried

Who you are and how far you were created to fly?

And there's no limit to, what together

So you might even notice, there's not a single one
Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise!

There will always be somebody who got something to say

Cause Jesus said He opens doors that no man can shut
And it don't matter 'bout your status or mistakes you made in your past
If God is for you He got your back like a coat tag
Trust me, you can note that, in Him there is no lack
You can drick from His fount in Zion's Mountain With no cash
Man, ya life is on smash, but you're in ya room
With a box of tissues, wiping sniffles, wishing for Ya tomb
But the sky is the limit God knew you in the womb

They'll never go nowhere, as long as you care
So you gotta understand
There's gonna always be a man, tellin you that you can't
So if you never spread your wings, you can't youch the sky
And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried
So are you really gonna let someone else decide
Who you are and how far you were created to fly?

You are so wonderful and fearfully made! 
Albe to do all things great! 
Oh, you better know your maker
Cause He's got a plan a purpose for you
And there's no limit to, what together
You can do! 

So you might even notice, there's not a single one
Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise! 
Cause you just might be the one to listen and obey
Despite the doubt and all the uncertainty
Significance is not built on what meets the eye
It's who you are and how far you were created to fly! 

You are so wonderful and fearfully made! 
Albe to do all things great! 
Oh, you better know your maker
Cause He's got a plan a purpose for you
And there's no limit to, what together
You can do! 

There will always be haters like commentators who get carried away
There will always be somebody who got something to say
But don't fret or be discouraged when your plans are cut
Cause Jesus said He opens doors that no man can shut
And it don't matter 'bout your status or mistakes you made in your past
If God is for you He got your back like a coat tag
Trust me, you can note that, in Him there is no lack
You can drick from His fount in Zion's Mountain With no cash
Man, ya life is on smash, but you're in ya room
With a box of tissues, wiping sniffles, wishing for Ya tomb
But the sky is the limit God knew you in the womb
You got ya eye on the clouds, and He's trying to give you the moon
So step back for a second and realize your purpose
Yea, people gonna talk but know God's will is perfect
Beckah Shae is here to tell you when you're trying to cross an obstacle
Know that God is with you, and He'll make all possible

You are so wonderful and fearfully made! 
Albe to do all things great!

But keep the secret, today no one can touch you
Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed
Alone at night it's dark
Hear a lonely dog bark

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

",Come into the Air,1980
Ricky Ford,"In the beginning was the word, man said: Let there be more light
Electric scenes and laser beams, neon brights the light abhorring nights
On the second day he said: Let's have a gas
Hydrogen and cholera and pest
Let's make some germs, we'll poison the worms
Man will never be suppressed

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen, amen, amen

On the third we get green and blue for pie
On the fourth we send rockets to the sky
On the fifth make the beasts and submarines
On the sixth man prepares his final dream:
In our image, let's make robots for our slaves
Imagine all the time that we can save
Computers, machines, the silicon dream
Seventh he retired from the scene

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen (amen), amen (amen), amen (amen)

On the eighth day machine just got upset
A problem man had never seen as yet
No time for flight, a blinding light
And nothing but a void, forever night

He said: Behold what man has done
There's not a world for anyone
Nobody laughed, nobody cried
World's at an end, everyone has died
Forever amen (amen), amen (amen), amen (amen)

Ricky Ford,"What do you do when they turn on the light?
You guard your heart, so they steal your sight
You reach out in blindness, touch the alone
His icicle fingers chill you to the bone

What do you do when the cat gets ya tongue?
No way to tell it's all going wrong
Mouth out the words on the telephone
Nobody answers, nobody's home...

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

Well, I reach out in blindness now, but what do I care?
I'll walk into walls and I'll stumble downstairs
I'll laugh like a fishwife, I'll cry like a clown
Up is the only way to go when you're down

When I reach a mountain top, then I start to climb
I'll walk on the water, I'll turn water to wine
Hope is the one thing we got on our side
Hope can be salvaged when all else has died

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun

Ricky Ford,"What kind of things are you that deliver papers
White papers that you say apply to me
Reams of rules constructed for protection
Protection for yourselves, but not for me

You hide behind your walls of bureaucracy
I find that you've nothing to do with me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

Today you went out to inspect your servants
I saw you wave and rave from my T.V.
You promised soon that they would have a paper
Give them the right to kill quite legally

So you hide in your palace of bureaucracy
I hope that you never come terminate me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

Ricky Ford,"Round and round and round again
Increasing circles, what a fun game!
We think we're different, we're not the same
As you and me and she and he

And we always believed that we're something unique
Our new little rich friends want us in their clique
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

There's you scratching my back, me scratching yours
Rub up the right way, it always ensures
We'll know the right people, open right doors
To the land of the famous incredible bores

And I got no respect for you, you're just a fake
Gave up your lot for a bite of the cake
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stuck at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

Your smug little cliches, they get up my nose
Your hair dyed, your fine clothes, they're all for the pose
Naked before me, your cover is blown

Here come the robots, the mindless, the clones
And you sold up our insides, body and soul
Do as you're told now, and we'll play our roles
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stop at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel

Ricky Ford,"Living in the shadow of the mushroom tower
Who needs it?
Find no shelter from that kind of shower
Who needs it?
Nuclear rain, melting my brain
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

At the top of the tower there's a creature who wants power
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
If he gets in the dungeon, he could just press the button
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
He'll flee inside, and you'll have nowhere to hide
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it
Here comes the era, the era of the living dead

Ricky Lynn Gregg,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Quiet nights just you and me

And the floor's thump, thump thumpin' underneath our feet

Gonna beat it like a drum

Ricky Lynn Gregg,"It hurts down deep when angry words are spoken
Because of this countless tears are shed
Much too often tender hearts are broken
When hasty thoughtless angry words are said
As you know I stormed out of the house again this mornin'
I slammed the door and didn't even take your usual kiss
Well angry words can make us do things without a warnin'
I could hardly wait to get back home to tell you this
First of all you're the reason for my living
You've stuck with me when things were at their worst
We've got the home the kids and the joy they're giving
But over all you always will come first
We found out a long ago this life's no paradise
We're not angels or else we'd all have wings
Above all angry words I hope you realize that I love you if that means anything




",Angry Words,2009
Ricky Lynn Gregg,"I've got a sad sad story friend that I don't like to tell
I had a home and fam'ly when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years a long long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me cause I've got life to go
Well I went one night where the lights were bright just to see what I could see
I met up with the old friend who just thought the world of me
Well he brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Then words were said and now he's dead I just had to bring him down
Well it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
I know I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
Well I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go
Well I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
No I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go

Ricky Martin,"La conoci en el carnaval
En Rio de Janeiro
Sin hablar, en el bulevar
Esa noche bailamos tango

Extrao su boca carioca, sensual
Que roza al mover los hombros
Extrao su aroma, su piel
No me importa
La sigo hasta el fin del mundo

why bailamos por un callejon
Why bailamos sin parar
Com sus ojos me embrujo
La diosa del carnaval carnaval

Amanecio, no me dijo adios
Mientras yo soaba
Solo me dejo una noche de amor
Why una rosa en su almohada

Busco su voz why su canto gitano
En mi alma dejo una huella
Anhelo el calor de su cuerpo e sus besos
No aguanto vivir sin ella

why bailamos por un callejon
Why bailamos sin parar
Com sus ojos me embrujo

Ricky Martin,"Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you baby can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me

It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Let your private emotion come to me
Come to me

When your soul is tired
And your heart is weak
Do you think of love
As a one way street
Well it runs both ways,
Open up your eyes
Can't you see me here,
How can you deny
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight

Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by
But you can find me here
Till your tears run dry
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight",Private Emotion,1999
Ricky Martin,"I met a girl at the carnival 
In Rio de Janeiro 
We danced all night on the boulevard 
In doorways we did the tango 

I miss her lips 
And the way she sashayed her hips 
As she shook her shoulders 
I miss the smell of her hair 
I don't care if it takes my whole life to find her 

[Chorus]
We were dancing in the summer rain 
We were dancing through the night 
I never knew her name 
So I called her Spanish eyes 
Spanish eyes

The sun came up 
And the girl was gone 
Her masquerade was over 
I searched the streets drunk with love 
But no one seemed to know her 

I miss the touch 
Of her body so much 
I long for the warmth inside her 
Somewhere in time she will come back to me 
And I'll spend my whole life beside her 

[Chorus]",Spanish Eyes,1999
Ricky Martin,"Met you underneath the moon 
Night was over much too soon 
We shared a kiss till daylight came 
And kissed the night goodbye 
When the sun came up that day 
We smiled and went our 
Separate ways 
But I can't leave the thought of 
You behind 

Oh you stay with me 
You stay with me 
Oh in my heart 
And on my mind 
Oh like a melody that keeps haunting me 
Oh you stay 

I look inside the small cafes 
And hope by chance I'll see your face 
I hear your voice and realize 
It's just the summer wind 
Something in your eyes that night 
Swept away this heart of mine 
Now I just want you in my arms again 

Oh, you stay with me

How was I to know in that one night 
My whole life would change 
From the moment I looked in your eyes 
I've never been the same 
And if I could have one chance to have that 
Moment back again 
I'd never let it end 
I'd never let it end

I ever thought you'd find me
Amor, fell into a kiss
And left the world behind me

Way to believe my lies
And never know it

I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Deja, deja
Cuidado que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again

Amor, never was a touch
Enough to just persuade me
Amor, now that I can feel my heart
My thoughts evade me

Nos damos un beso y no siento tus labios
En tus ojos no luce el azul del cielo
Te miro y lo que veo me parece extraño

Cuando se abre la puerta
No me late el corazón
Si en la noche te encuentro
Ya no pierdo la razón
Cuando estoy a tu lado no se me
Acelera el pulso
Tus caricias y abrazos ya no me queman

Cambia la piel y liberarte
De ese viejo amor que te hizo sufrir
Cambia la piel y límpiate
Todo ese rencor que no te haré bien

Volvieron los recuerdos que tanto
Te hicieron mal
Volvió la tristeza que te oprimí el alma
Y la amistad y el cariño que tanto
Nos unió
Cayeron en las redes de la desconfianza

Ya no tiembla tu cuerpo cuando
Hacemos el amor
Y a pesar del tiempo
Parece que nada sucedió
La complicidad que
Antes hubo entre los dos
Se subió a una paloma
Y se fue volando

Cambia la piel y olvídate
Del resentimiento que ensucia
Tu sangre
Cambia la piel, cierra la herida
Que se abrió aquel día y que nunca curo

Cambia la piel y convéncete
Que vine por ti para hacerte feliz
Cambia la piel y llámame
Olvídate de ese viejo amor
Cambia la piel olvídate ya

Mi alma es fuerte cuando estoy cerca de ti

Cuando ves que el amor se va muriendo
Desvaneciéndose en mi piel
No me dejes solo aquí con mi dolor

No temas ven a mi
Quiero calmar mi cuerpo junto a ti
Entrégame tu amor
Para matar este sufrir

Las cosas han cambiado entre tú y yo
Para mal o para bien
Me consumo en el vació de esta soledad
Y te busco más que ayer

Cuando ves que los sueños van muriendo
Desvaneciéndose en mi piel
No me dejes solo aquí con mi dolor

No temas ven a mi
Quiero calmar mi cuerpo junto a ti
Entrégame tu amor
Para matar este sufrir

Ricky Martin,"Mil y una vidas ya pase 
Muchos corazones me robó
Siete maravillas pude ver 
Y solo tu leyenda se escribió en mi piel 

Atrapado, moribundo
Con esas ganas de bailar contigo 
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
No te mantengas no te esquives déjate llevar 

Porque esta noche, tu serás mía
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
La luna llena se hará trizas sino ya verás 
Porque esta noche tu serás mía

Sabes manejar la seducción 
Bailas con la piel y la pasión 
Me ha mordido ya la tentación 
Solo quiero desnudarte el corazón 

Atrapado, moribundo
Con esas ganas de bailar contigo 
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
Dame jaleo ole ole ole ole ola
No te mantengas no te esquives déjate llevar

Ricky Martin,"Jamás volverás a mirarme como lo hiciste antes 
Jamás volverás a ser dueña del recuerdo de amor 
Jamás volverás a confundirme con tu falso diamante 
Ya no voy a creer en tu carita arrepentida jamás 

Usando tus mentiras me envolviste el corazón 
Por tus disculpas fui una tumba de inconsciencia 
Paciencia yo bendigo, vendo mi resignación 
Te vuelves repulsiva por jugar con mi conciencia 

Jamás volverás a mirarme como lo hiciste antes 
Jamás volverás a ser dueña del recuerdo de amor 
Jamás volverás a confundirme con tu falso diamante 
Ya no voy a creer en tu carita arrepentida jamás 

Que pierdas la cabeza si hace falta dignidad 
Estuviste como dama ocultando tu miseria 
Malicia tan rastrera, te me vuelves tentación 
Vací­o que me aleja lo que anhelo ya tu ausencia 

Jamás volverás a mirarme como lo hiciste antes 
Jamás volverás a ser dueña del recuerdo de amor 
Jamás volverás a confundirme con tu falso diamante 
Ya no voy a creer en tu carita arrepentida jamás 
Ya no voy a creer en tu carita arrepentida jamás 

Pobre de aquel que te crea a ti
Pobre de aquel que le crea al amor
Pobre de aquel que le crea al amor

Jamás volverás a confundirme con tu falso diamante 
Ya no voy a creer en tu carita arrepentida jamas",Jamás,2003

Fue tan suficiente verlo en tu mirada 
Clara como cristal

Vas antecediendo todos mis instintos

Sol

Y mis días se reducen a tu espacio

Ricky Martin,"Si ya no estás aquí
Mi vida es diferente 
Si ya no estás aquí
Traspaso entre la gente 
Soy caminante vagando sin prisa 
En el vació en que escondí tus caricias 
Donde no existe rencor ni malicia 
Donde suelo ir a morir 

Presiento labios cerrados para no invocar recuerdos 
Manos atadas para no arriesgar deseos 
Tomar prestado por amor correr el riesgo 
Romper distancias para sobornar al tiempo 

Ven, corazón que ya no siente es porque ojos ya no ven 
Hoy te quiero de rehén

Traspaso entre la gente 
Soy caminante vagando sin prisa 
En el vacío en que escondí tus caricias 
Donde no existe rencor ni malicia 
Donde suelo ir a morir 

Decreto, ojos callados para no encallar misterios 
Beso francés que es como antídoto y veneno 
Como un prejuicio restaurando otro desprecio 
Cobrando deuda reclamando entre lo ajeno 

Ven, corazón que ya no siente es porque ojos ya no ven 
Hoy te quiero de rehén 

Si ya no estas aquí
Mi vida es diferente 
Si ya no estas aquí
Traspaso entre la gente

Ricky Martin,"Tal vez será 
Que esa historia ya tiene final 
No sé por qué
Hoy te siento tan distante de mí

Que a pesar que lo intento de nuevo 
Tal vez llegué tarde, ya no hay nada que hacer 
Y no puedo creer que el tiempo que hemos tenido 
Tal vez se nos gastó

Tal vez fui yo quien no te dio una noche entera 
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas 
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas 
Tal vez no te escuché, tal vez me descuidé
Tal vez se me olvidó que yo te amaba

Tal vez
Ay, ay, ay, ay 

Tal vez será 
Que por ahora ya no hay nada qué hablar 
Tal vez, esta vez 
Necesitamos tiempo para pensar 

Y yo por mi parte propongo intentarlo de nuevo
Volver a empezar 
Que por más que lo pienso, no encuentro una sola razón 
Para seguir sin ti

Tal vez fui yo quien no te dio una noche entera 
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas 
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas 
Tal vez no te escuché, tal vez me descuidé
Tal vez se me olvidó que yo te amaba

Tal vez me sorprendió la vida por la espalda 
Y tira y tira y se rompió la cuerda 
Tal vez nunca entendí lo que eras para mí

Ricky Martin,"Escucho el comentario
De todos mis amigos
Qué me hallan diferente
Estoy tan destruido

Qué apenas soy la sombra
Soy un desconocido
Qué a veces ni respondo
Qué ya no soy el mismo

Y todos siempre piensan
Saber más de la cuenta
Lo sienten, lo conversan
Y de ello se alimentan

Mientras que la sangre aquí en mi corazón
Va subiendo arriba la temperatura
Mientras mi locura, va con tu cordura
Mientras yo te extrañe, yo te sienta, yo te ame

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Quizá yo le pido al
Amor demasiado
Quizá por exceso y
Demás he pecado
Quizá por costumbre
Tal vez por temores
No se porque si no se si hay
Razones

Quizá por demencia
Piedad o clemencia
Quizá por amarte, por
Necesitarte
Quizá porque lejos de
Ti es demasiado
Quizá porque todas
Mis necesidades las tengo de ti mientras yo te ame

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Y yo aquí muriendo y
Tu como si nada
Pero la razón me vuelve a controlar
Y dentro de mi es el
Dolor que habla
Que conversa a solas con mi soledad

Vienes, te apareces y te veo
Y es que aquí no pasa
El tiempo
Y yo muriendo

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer, yo intento, yo intento

Yo intento, salir del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido, yo no te olvido",Y Todo Queda en Nada,2003

I don't care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Promised me
You'd always be
You'd never let me go
You took the ring and
All the things that came with being my girl

The tragedy as I walked through that door
You had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
It was just like a movie
Too real to be
That just can't be my bride to be, no

I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

Crazy boy was he just kept going
'Cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I've fallen so in love
With someone I'd known for years
Not even know that
She'd be the one
To reveal my worst fears

It was just like a movie
Too real to be that just can't be my bride to be no
I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take

Every time I look at you, I realize what I got to do 
It's soothing and take you under the rain 

And I feel so nice
Crossing all the lines, taking an chance 
Doing what we need to feel alive 
And I feel so right
Come and do it now, we got to scream, scream all night 

[Chorus] 
It's alright, don't be afraid don't hesitate now 
Feels right, let's take it now don't wait for later 
Tonight, and if it feels right just let it go 
And if it's alright you got to let it flow 

It's alright, don't be afraid don't hesitate now 
Feels right, let's take it now don't wait for later 
Tonight, and if it feels right just let it go 
And if it's alright you got to let it flow 

If I'm wrong don't want to know 
If I'm right just let it show 
It's crazy, so crazy it just might be 
I only care about today, tomorrow is too far away 
Let's take it, and run run away with me 

It feels so nice,
Crossing all the lines, taking any chance 
Doing what we need to feel alive 
Yeah it feels so right,
Come and do it now, we got to scream, scream all night 

[Chorus] 

I think I love you, 
And I need you by my side baby to the morning light 
I know I want you, 
What I got for you is love 
I got love, love, love, love

[Chorus] 

Don't be afraid don't hesitate now 
Let's take it now don't wait for later 
And if it feel right just let it go 
And if it's alright you got to let it flow 
And if it's alright you got to let it flow",It's Alright,2005
Ricky Martin,"Life, it's the only thing that you get for free
Free is what we all want to be
Take a walk around the block til you see
Everything you want life to be

Tell your mother, beg your father
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, don't try to save it
Sooner or later, you will discover
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can't make it 
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can't make it 

It's the love alive gets that is both
Love it's the only dream in my heart and soul
Easier to dream than it is to cry
When you're in love goodbye

Tell your mother, beg your father
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, don't try to save it
Sooner or later, you will discover

Ricky Martin,"I met you on a side, an accidental hi
And I missed you, before I met you
Your lips I want to taste, it's not the time and place
And it can't be, I'm sorry
It's like we've talked a thousand times
And made love with our eyes

[Chorus: x2]
But tonight is not the night
I'm with somebody else and I can't lie
With me and you, it's never goodbye
Save the dance for another life
I'm guilty in my mind, cause I can't close my eyes
My spirit, can hear it
So let the music play, the changes I can't make
To heal you, conceal you
It's like we've walked a thousand miles
To make love with our eyes

Without you
Wish that I could tell you that tomorrow is all about you
But it's time to meet you in another life

Hold you tight, and wrap this night around me

[Chorus]
I wish that we could stop time tonight
Stay in this moment forever
I wish that we could live in this kiss
And stay just like this
Together, together

I want to lay here with you
Kiss you slow and hold you close forever
I want to reach, and feel you near, right here
Right here in my arms, in my arms
To hold you while you're sleeping
To be lost in this feeling

That you would deceive me

While I'll hit him with the fo fo fo
I know you keep saying that you lovin' me so
But why the hell are you crushin' him for

Ricky Martin,"Dejo abierta la ventana por si llega una canción
Why una red de mariposas colgando en el balcón
Por si el viento deja alguna historia ahí enredada 
Why notas olvidadas sin rasgos de tu ausencia

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, tengo que arrancar de mi memoria 
Cada verso que empezaba con tu nombre

Quedaran algunas letras en errante melodía
Un puñado de palabras a medio terminar
Cuando el tiempo deje este camino abandonado
Sin llegar a ningún lado why desnudo de tus huellas

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus besos
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria 
Cada verso que empezaba con tu nombre

Esta es la última vez
Que canto tu nombre
Tu nombre

Esta es la última vez

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, antes de cerrar mis ojos
Tengo que olvidarme de tu piel
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria
Cada verso que empezaba con tu nombre

Que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve
Nadie ocupara tu lucar

Sobra tanto espacio
Si no estas
No paso un minuto sin pensar
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

Algo me dice
Ya no sirve de nada
Tantas noches en vela
Aferrado a mi almohada

Si pudiera tan solo regresar un momento
Ahora es que te comprendo
Ahora es cuando te pierdo

Vuelve
Que sin ti la vida se me va

Y a pesar que fui yo
A decirte que no
Sin embargo aqui sigo insistiendote

Ricky Martin,"Traigo en los bolsillos tanta soledad
Desde que te fuiste no me queda más
Que una foto gris y un triste sentimiento

Lo que más lastima es tanta confusión
En cada resquicio de mi corazón
Como hacerte a un lado de mis pensamientos

Por ti, por ti, por ti
He dejado todo sin mirar atrás
Aposté la vida y me dejé ganar

Te extraño, porque vive en mí tu recuerdo
Te olvido, a cada minuto lo intento
Te amo, es que ya no tengo remedio
Te extraño, te olvido, te amo de nuevo

Te extraño, porque vive en mí tu recuerdo
Te olvido, a cada minuto lo intento
Te amo, es que ya no tengo remedio
Te extraño, te olvido, te amo de nuevo

No, oh no, oh no

He perdido todo, hasta la identidad
Y si lo pidieras más podría dar
Es que cuando se ama nada es demasiado

Me enseñaste el limite de la pasión
Y no me enseñaste a decir adiós
He aprendido ahora que te has marchado

Por ti, por ti, por ti
He dejado todo sin mirar atrás
Aposté la vida y me dejé ganar

Te extraño, porque vive en mí tu recuerdo
Te olvido, a cada minuto lo intento
Te amo, es que ya no tengo remedio

Cantaba en el subway
Con su beat box y su electric guitar
Por las noches era DJ
Se paraban en las sillas
Y se ponía el mundo a girar

Cuando se bailaba hasta morir
Saltando al cielo
Con esa locura de vivir

Hay que pedirle
Más más más a la vida
Que sea hasta que se apague el sol
Y la luna
Y que no importe
Más más más lo que digan
Como si fuera la la ultima noche

Ser modelo y conquistar Nueva York
Maquillada todo el día

Hay que pedirle
Más más más a la vida
Que sea hasta que se apague el sol

Haz lo que tu sientas
Sigue tu destino

Ricky Martin,"Mírame, no tengas miedo
Déjame, contarte mis secretos
Nunca fui, ni soy perfecto
Quiero ser contigo un libro abierto
Debes saber que un santo no pretendo ser, 
No me arrepiento del ayer
Y en el futuro seguiré siendo quien soy
Así soy yo

Por lo menos no te miento
Te digo la verdad
Yo no te miento
Está es mi realidad 
En estos ojos tu veras, 
No tengo nada que ocultar
Me juego la vida sin mentira hasta el final

Y si te vas después de todo, 
Seguirá brillando tu camino
No hay mal que por bien no venga, 
No hay pasos que no dejan huellas
Aunque nos duela corazón a corazón
Y hacemos daño sin razón
Llegamos desnudos a este mundo
Inocentes frente a Dios

Y por eso no te miento
Te digo la verdad
Yo no te miento
Esta es mi realidad 
En estos ojos tu verás, 
No tengo nada que ocultar
Me juego la vida sin mentira hasta el final

Quién no es un pecador, con sus penas y dolor
Quién es alta sin caer y del fuego renacer
Van a hablar, me van a acusar, 
Con todas mis fallas me van a juzgar
Ya no dudes más de mi, te juro por mi vida

No te miento
Yo no te miento
Miento
Te digo la verdad
Yo no te miento
Esta es mi realidad 
En estos ojos tu verás, 
No tengo nada que ocultar
Me juego la vida sin mentira hasta el final

Yo no te miento
Te digo la verdad
Yo no te miento
Te digo la verdad

Ricky Martin,"We can talk, you can make your demands
We can cry, catch the tears in our hands
We can laugh and dance
Under this fading moon

And when the morning comes
I'll still be holding you

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our hearts be synchronized

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

I know you would catch me
Should I fall from grace
If I heard you drowning in the dark
I'd dive into the waves

We can make a vow and seal it with a kiss
The moments that we shared will matter more
Than those we missed

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

In another place, in another time
In another space, in another life
In another world you could still be mine
We'll shine, we'll shine

Shine, brighter than a rain of fallen stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night, there's no goodbye
Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars

Ricky Martin,"Mi corazón es un cazador
Adicto al calor de tu piel, al sabor de tu amor
Tus labios son mi cruel obsesión
La sed y el hambre de la seducción
Dominan en mi ser
La sombra que ves, no es una ilusión

Te busco y te alcanzo
Me pierdo en tu llanto
Te quiero en mis brazos
De frente temblando

Soy flecha perdida
Te busco y te alcanzo

A donde vas, yo te voy a atrapar
Te escondes de mi pero al fin
No te vas a salvar

Por que siempre huyes de mi?
La trampa mortal
Es querer lo que no es para ti
Es un desastre total
Por qué el ser humano es así

Están envenenando tus fantasías
Te siguen provocando de noche y día
Te estas atormentando con una espina

Mordiendo tu sonrisa
Y amarte hasta caer
Perdido en tus caricias

Sudando entre las sabanas
Volverte a recorrer
Jugando con malicia

I'm new'I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too!

I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back'you wanna know what'cha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality!

Fill me up with your heat with your noise,
With your dirt overdo me.
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud,
Let it hurt, run it through me.
Don't hold back you are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying.

Hello Buenos Aires
Get this! Just look at me dressed up somewhere to go
We'll put on a show.

Take me in a your flood, give me speed,
Give me lights, set me humming.
Shoot me up with your blood,
Wine me up with your nights, watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing

Stand back Buenos Aires
Because you wanna know what'cha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality!

And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town'I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best

What makes a city hum? Who gives it life? The descamisados, the shirtless ones, the laborers, the butchers, the dockers, the shuffling workers in the stockyard, in the factories and on the treadmill. Do these people have ambitions, views, opinions!
They will soon.

Don't you just love the smack of firm government? We all appreciate the invaluable support, order and purpose provided by the military to our constitution. It will soon be time for the military to be our constitution, say some, notably the military.

The gathering at the polo ground glitters. The Bentleys, the hampers from Harrods, the diamonds, the clothes, the procession of nannies from England and France. Who on earth, or in Argentina, would want to pull the rug out from under the polished feet of le cr??me of Buenos Aires society?

You will shine to the dead, you are shoddy.

Give me credit'I'll find ways of paying

Ricky Martin,"Pasaron tantas cosas
Antes de querer parar, parar, parar
Te perdiste en otras vidas y al final
La encontraste sin buscar
Todo por casualidad

Hoy aceptas tu pasado
Porque él te enseñó a amar, amar a amar
Tu mejor futuro de su mano va
Él te escucha sin juzgar
Mil historias que vivir
Y contar

Tu sabías que lo que era
Vivir entre las tinieblas
Pudiste ver a tiempo el humo
Que daba la hoguera
Tu entendías su quimera
Y él intentaba ser el hombre que todo el mundo quisiera

Te pasaron tantas cosas
Que nadie vio jamas, jamás, jamás
Él comparte su destino sin dudar
Ahora es más fácil respirar
Cada vez un poco más

Y así van cerrando las heridas
Aunque a veces se excusaran
Pesa más el porvenir que lo que pudisteis vivir
Tanto amor no hay Dios que lo pueda dividir

Tu sabías que lo que era
Vivir entre las tinieblas
Pudiste ver a tiempo el humo
Que daba la hoguera
Tu entendías su quimera
Y él intentaba ser el hombre que todo el mundo quisiera

Hoy no existe ya la duda
Y es que las manos se han cansado de ser mudas
Él es tanto para ti
Que de ilusión ya no puedes vivir
Si ahora tienes que huir otra vez
Y por el mismo camino de ayer",Quimera [*],2014

Ricky Martin,"Tu me haces falta como sol en el verano
Diploma en el graduado y pasaporte al viajar
Te necesito mas que la guerra a un soldado
La pensión del retirado y una boda con su altar

Voy a extrañarte mas que al cable a la corriente
El veneno a una serpiente y la selva a un animal
Te echo de menos como ropa a su perchero
Amar sin tener celos y un diamante sin tallar

Dime que hacer
Pa librarme de tu veneno
Que introduce tu boca en mi piel
Te escapas como agua en mis dedos no puedo

Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
De tu cara, tu boca, tu pelo
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
De la forma que tocas mi cuerpo

Pienso seguirte como un siervo buscando una excusa
Poeta con su musa y a un político a ganar
Y amarte despacito como carne en el asado
Un bolero encantado y una historia sin final

Dime que hacer
Pa librarme de tu veneno
Que introduce tu boca en mi piel
Te escapas como agua en mis dedos no puedo

Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti

Ricky Martin,"Aquí va mi confesión
Antes de ti no fui un santo
He pecado como no
Pero eso es cosa del pasado
Desde que llegaste tu
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causo
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón

Cuantas noches de pasión
Cuantas mañanas tan vacías
Y un error tras otro error
Con estas sábanas tan frías
Desde que llegaste tu
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón

No entendí cómo pasó
Con la destreza de un buen francotirador
Cada una de tus balas en el alma me pegó

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón",Disparo al Corazón,2015
Ricky Martin,"Tierra,
Aquí nació mi canto, mi bandera,
Sonrisas que se cuelan por la puerta del balcón,
Y este viaje que hoy me trae de vuelta.

Lejos,
No sabes cuanto echo de menos,
El ruido de mi pueblo y la caricia de este mar,
Cuando no estoy contigo yo te invento.

Traigo oxidado el corazón, me hace falta cuerda,
Mi alma necesita transfusión, sangre de mi tierra
Regreso a la cuna que me vio nacer,
Regreso a ese barrio que me vio correr,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.
De vuelta al refugio que calma el dolor,
Y huele al recuerdo del primer amor,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.

Lento,
Las marcas van contándome que el tiempo,
Es como un pasajero que se sube en tu vagón,
Y anuncia que la vida es un momento.

Dicen,
Los viejos de la esquina siempre dicen,
No importa lo que tenga si al bajar de la estación,
Uno regresa siempre a sus raíces.

Traigo oxidado el corazón, me hace falta cuerda,
Mi alma necesita transfusión, sangre de mi tierra
Regreso a la cuna que me vio nacer,
Regreso a ese barrio que me vio correr,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.

Y huele al recuerdo del primer amor,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.",Isla Bella,2015
Ricky Martin,"Mi estrategia no funciona al tiempo
Y la razón para ser tu rival
Desarmame, enfrentame.
Y si me hicieras preso de tu cuerpo
Esa condena cumpliria hasta el final
De tanto amar, soy criminal.

Es un suicidio probar de tu boca si después te escapas.
Eres tú, en mi piel acaricia en la herida.

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir mas bella que en tus brazos lento.
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
Sin ti.

Esta armadura que soporta el fuego
Se vuelve frágil a tu voluntad
Disparame, si eres capaz.
Mi tortura es saber que mañana
Nada cambia todo sigue igual
Porque te iras, sin avisar.

Es un delito quitarte la ropa y que después te vallas.
Eres tú, de mi piel acaricia la herida.

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir mas bella que en tus brazos lento.
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
De nuevo sin ti.

Que me quiero, que me quiero, que me quiero ir contigo

Como un regalo, algo divino
Justo en el momento que más dolía
En la tormenta desatada en mi velero a la deriva
Vi en tus ojos en el mar en calma
Tu voz me dijo no pasa nada
Y naufragaron tus manos por mi espalda
La almohada fue testigo del placer que derramaba

Como le dices que te vas
De una manera tan cobarde
Como le dices que te vas
Si justo empezaba a enamorarme
Quien callara esta soledad
Que me pregunta sin respuestas
Tú me viniste a rescatar
Y me abandonas como isla desierta

Vuelvo a caer en el combate
Me toca perder tras jaque mate
Intento no olvidarte por más que trate
Eres como droga y como adicto salgo yo a buscarte
Y al final te veo, sonríes, me atrapas
Tal si fuera un reo, desarmas de nuevo mi alma
Robando de mi cuerpo lo que queda hasta saciarte
Úsame pero no te marches

Como le dices que te vas
De una manera tan cobarde
Como le dices que te vas
Si justo empezaba a enamorarme
Quien callara esta soledad
Que me pregunta sin respuestas

En un naufragio sin final

I can hear my heavy breathing.
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right;
something there I can believe in .

Voices are calling from inside my head.
I can hear them, I can hear them,
vanishing memories of things that were said,
they can't try to hurt me now.

But a shot in the dark, one step away from you.
A shot in the dark, always creeping up on you

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate

Certain people don't wanna learn but he shows a 'tude
And those blokes never used to go to school
Now they wanna come and push up with some playground moves
And a grown man should put down those childish things
And let the knowledge of one's self resonate within
But something in his life isn't right with him

I don't know if you know

He's so good looking
The traffic stops
He's a politician
A heavenly cop
Words of healing
Fall from his lips
Lifting up the weak
Is in his gift

People say yeah
To the hall of office
And the foreign stage
Maybe at last
The world's a
Better place
He's brought down swiftly
By the
Hand of fate
The people weep
And the thought remains

When you fight for every breath
Do you stop to think about your friends or do you
Realize
That in that moment separating life and death
You want to take what you can get
And maybe
Only wake up
But not

Things keep on selling

And here`s your jacket
And here`s your cuff links

And sulk back to the fold

Do you pause before you turn over the page?
And although there is no photograph

No tears on television
Do you find yourself reminded of their eyes?
Can you feel?
Can you?

At every roadside shrine
Where faded flowers console
I shudder for the life
Inside your northern soul

Every night you sleep
I'll lie down on your pillow
And I feel each steady breath
From your northern soul

When every light's gone out
And my body's tired and old

But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me.

He's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I'm packing my troubles I'm bound with his love

Driving fine cars wherever you go
There's coming a time when we'll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day",Mansions for Me,1980
Ricky Skaggs,"Mother left this world of sorrow
Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad

There's a little lonesome grave yard
On these tombstones it did say
On mother's ""gone but not forgotten""
On dad's ""we'll meet again someday""

I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest

Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love",Memories of Mother and Dad,1980

She said ""Son you ought to quit this old ramblin' all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife.""

I'd leave in a hurry
I'd find me a place where I could stay
And not have to worry.

A place I could lose the Tennessee Blues.

I'd find me a spot on some mountain top
With no one around me

Down one lane I'd find happiness
And down the other I would lose
There is no one that I can trust
I must decide alone
My decision is an awful one
Which road will take me home?

[Chorus]
In the mornin' would I wake to find
Down the wrong road I had gone?
Will I hear the melodies
I've searched for oh so long
Only time will tell
If I have made a loser's choice
Hello sadness, cries my inner soul
Goodbye lover, moans my voice

Perils today are many
As I set out on my way
If I lose your love, I know that I
Can't call it back someday
Rambler, lonely rambler
Just calls any place his home
But Nashville's lights
How beautiful you shine

Wishing now that you had found
A word or two to say
But the morning came and we both knew
My eyes gave it away
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye
I thought, only time will tell
And you can't draw water from an empty well

[Chorus]

Two highways lay before me
Which one would I choose?
Down one lane I'd find happiness
And down the other I would lose

Which road will take me home?",Two Highways,1984
Ricky Skaggs,"I've been living a new way,
All the life that I love so.
But I can see the clouds are gathering,
And the storm will wreck our home.

For last night he held you tightly,
And you didn't even shove.
This is true for I was watching,
From the window up above.

You must have thought that I was sleeping,
And I wish that I had been.
But it's best to get to know you,
And the way your heart can sin.

I thought we belonged together,
And our hearts fit like a glove.
I was wrong for I've been watching,
From the window up above.

From my eyes, a teardrop started,
As I listened on and on.
I heard you whisper to him, softly,
And our marriage was all wrong.

Well, I hope he makes you happy,
And you'll never lose his love.
I lost mine while I was watching,
From the window above.

How I wish I could be dreamin',
And wake up to a love that's true.
I lost mine while I was watching,
From the window up above",Window up Above,1984
Ricky Skaggs,"If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S.
If you're so happy, you land in jail. I'm your bail
When other friendships are soon forgot, ours will still be hot
Da da da da da da dig dig dig
If you're ever up a tree, just phone to me
If you ever loose your teeth when you're out to dine, borrow mine
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgeet, ours will still be great
Loddle doddle chuck chuck chaa
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose.
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I'll complain.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are soon forgit, ours will still be it.
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap.
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind.
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt.
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick.
Ah loddle doddle woof woof woof, hep hep hep, chopp chop chop, dig dig dig.
Good evening friends.",Friendship,1984
Ricky Skaggs,"Oh, the people would come from far away,
To dance all night to the break of day.
When the caller would holler: ""Do Si Do"",
They knew Uncle Pen was ready to go.
Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Well, he played an old tune they called the ""Soldier's Joy"",
And he played the one they called the ""Boston Boy"".
Greatest of all was the ""Jennie Lynn"",
To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins.

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away,
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow,
And he knew it was time for him to go.
Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing",Uncle Pen,1985
Ricky Skaggs,"The clubs are all closed and there's no where to go
When the sun wont show for hours
The streets have all emptied and lovers lay sleeping
And dreaming of each other.

[Chorus]
You've got a lover but it's not me.
He can't love you like I can
There will be others yes I understand
Will they love me like you can.

There's acres and acres of heartbroken lovers
I know we're not the first ones
But sometimes it seems that it's just like a dream
That you try hard to remember.

[Chorus]

The clubs are all closing you know
I was hoping that time would hold me over
I pull up my collar, walk into the night
I'll be looking for an answer.

[Chorus]",You've Got a Lover,1985
Ricky Skaggs,"There's a time in the morning when I feel a cold chill
And I try and forget what I know
It amazes me darling how your words haunt me still    
Though they're spoken so long ago

'Cause nothing can hurt you
Nothing can hurt you
No one can hurt you   
Like someone you love

Well I finally got over the words that you said    
That were spoken in anger to me         
Well the words lose their power but they're never quite dead      
You'll forget them but you can't forget me
 
'Cause nothing can hurt you
Nothing can hurt you
No one can hurt you   
Like someone you love

Why do we do it what can we gain
By hurting each other so bad    
Every time we go through it  it turns out the same
Left over from a love that don't last
There's a time in the morning when I roll back to sleep 
'Cause I don't want to remember our past  
It amazes me darling how the heartaches we keep   
Left over from a love that don't last

'Cause nothing can hurt you
Nothing can hurt you
No one can hurt you   
Like someone you love
 
Nothing can hurt you
Nothing can hurt you 
No one can hurt you
Like someone  someone you love",Nothing Can Hurt You,1985
Ricky Skaggs,"""Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
""This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
""It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
""Honey won't you open that door."" 
I honky-tonked around Dallas,
I got in a poker game.
Well, somebody must-a been a-cheatin',
I lost everything but my name.
Well, I walked half way to Memphis,
I finally got back home.
But I'd been better off where I was,
'Cause here's where things went wrong.

""Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
""This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
""It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
""Honey, won't you open that door."" 
Instrumental break.

I went right down to see old Bob, 
I thought he was my friend.
The landlord said that Bob's not here,
The police done hauled him in.
I ran right back to little Honey's house,
I got me a rockin' chair.
""Now, Honey if you don't open that door,
""I'm gonna rock on away from here.""

""Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
""This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?

Ricky Skaggs,"Always signed on to go on lifelong loving cruise
We set sail on a sea of love as an able bodied crew
With warm wind across the bow happiness did prevail
Three months out of port we were headed for an icy gale

First mate of mine well I see you fine
At the mop and broom a chore
Well lesson two is lost on you
It takes two to man the oars

And sorry ain't your cup of tea 
The words stick in your throat
Well I still believe your a fine girl 
But I swear your a rotten boat

Are you rockin' the boat honey
Just to get my goat
Well you can't keep love afloat
When you're rockin' that boat

You know before we left the shore
We saw things eye to eye
Now every time I reach for you
You're emotions wave bye-bye

And you know when a man jumps overboard
That man he's gone astray
You know you that I feel like bailin' out
When you keep my love at bay

Are you rockin' the boat honey
Just to get my goat
Well you can't keep love afloat
When you're rockin' that boat",Rockin' the Boat,1985
Ricky Skaggs,"I don't believe I've ever felt so lonely
My heart is never hurt this bad before
But I woke up this morning to find my one and only sayin' goodbye
Said she wouldn't be hangin' around no more

My baby walked out on me this morning
She left me behind now I'm lonely and wonderin'
If maybe there were something I could do
To make her change her mind and stay
This wonderin' why my baby left me
Is breakin' my heart and is driving me crazy
She didn't say why she was sayin' goodbye
She just walked away

I guess I'd be a fool to keep on runnin'
Cause I know it won't do no good nohow
Cause it's already passed the point of her return
I know that it's true
I guess I'd be better off to forget her somehow

She left me behind now I'm lonely and wonderin'
