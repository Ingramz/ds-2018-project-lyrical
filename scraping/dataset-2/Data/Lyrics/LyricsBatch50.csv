Chris Barber's Jazz Band,"Blues stay away from me
Uh-uh-uh, blues why don't you let me be
I don't know why you keep a-haunting me

True love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow we never can agree

My life is full of misery
And dreams are like a memory,
they're bringing back your love that used to be

I got teardrops so many I can't see
And years don't mean a thing to me
But time goes by and still I can't be free

Uh-uh-uh, blues stay away from me,
You hear me, blues why don't you let me be,
I don't know why you keep a-haunting me,
No, I don't know why you keep a-haunting me,

Chris Barber's Jazz Band,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows,1993

Remembering that spring day, that lonely night.

Remembering that summer day, that lonely night.

Happiness is above the clouds, 
Happiness is above the skies.
Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.
Remembering that autumn day, that lonely night.

Chris Barber's Jazz Band,"Stillness in the grove
Not a rustling sound
Softly shines the moon clear and bright
Dear, if you could know
How I treasure so
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn’t speak, though I’d love to say
That you’ve stolen my heart away
Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you’ll cherish dear, through the passing years

Say you’ll cherish dear through the passing years

Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Huh, I'm not sure of anything!

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!

Chris Bathgate,"I was a lonely little child
On the banks of a river wide
She was most beautiful and blue
And had rest on the other side
Unfurling foam
Far from every stone
And the trees began to sway
Lost my life in a roaring river wide
Just to be with you that day

No bridge, no boat
No way to stay afloat
As I began to cross
I was caught and kept in a current that could crush

And within the waves was lost
As my arms feigned and the water overcame
The waves began to sing
And in my ears, I swear to you my dear
Was a lovely silver ring

I was a lonely little child
In love with a silvery sound
Would you shed a tear for me my dear
For on that day I drowned",Riverwide,2005

The tight tightness in my chest rest and subsides
In one dull dawn with a hum that split its length
Does my name sting your tongue now does it babe
Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray
On our dim stretch of this street, how it aches
For every gray and sad hemmed heart to coil
And our frail eyes and their whites to finally toll

As my thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade

The one dull dawn I've sentenced to repeat",Serpentine,2007

Silently retreating down an empty hall
Suddenly a stirring
Finally recurring where I let it fall

Following the wanderings of a dream
A dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky
Believing in a love

Dancing with a stranger
Careless of the danger
There within his smile
While the dew was forming

Breathing in the morning
Like a sleeping child
If the memory of the light should fade
Horizons reaching cold and blue

Until your heart is free to fly
Then I will keep the sun for you
Until you touch the open sky
Then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodbye
Then I will keep the sun for you

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try

And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Chris Bennett,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

I dream of gardens in the desert sand

I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand

I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love

I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Chris Botti,"Old enough to be her dad
But the young men were just mad they nursed their grievances
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances

He sent her flowers and limousines

Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon if she would wear his ring

Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn

Yes all would envy

In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied that she was bored
She had no time for dancing - no time for dancing

But the clock upon the wall
That was ticking in the hall always reminded her
That life was going on elsewhere 
But she was happy and she whould swear she wouldn't change a thing

You're just two umbrellas one late afternoon 
You never know what you will say

It has no walls, the beauty of the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

And there's nothing wrong but there is something more

She says you've known her deepest fears 
'Cause she showed you a box of stained-glass tears 
It can't be all, the truth about the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

But when she gave you more to find 
You let her think she'd lost her mind 
And that's all on you 
Feeling helpless if she asked for help 
Or scared you'd have to change yourself 

And you can't deny this room will keep you warm. 
You can look out of your window at the storm 
But you watch the phone and hope it rings

Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Sei calda come i baci che ho perduto
Sei piena di un amore che è passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve coprirà tutte le cose
E forse un po' di pace tornerà

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

E tira forte vento
Sulla vecchia terazza
Davanti al golfo di surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si sciarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un?elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica
E si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide uscire la luna da una nuvola
Gli sembro più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all?improvisso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po?di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Dietro la scia di un?elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
E non ci penso poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai

And lost in your eyes

I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction
Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-stepping
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder

Toasting with my entourage, went from robbing armored cars

We throwing red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We The Best!) Big pimping, top down chrome spinning
""Top Gun"", Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson, that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso
Tell Hawaii 5-0 to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my Polo...

Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping
From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping
So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out

We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shopping

Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light, flashing
And I'm laughing, my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum, but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em

Relax and take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but sg talk to em!

Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun!

Go back a couple chapters
Back when there was laughter
Back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered
Before I forgot how much you mattered

Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldnt've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, 
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh
Give my all, you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (no)
I wish you just fake it for me (fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks wit' you I needed you (needed you)
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you (treated you)

Know you're missing something I wish I was what completed you

I can't find my way out
And it hurts

Chris Brown,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing

Singin' this'll be the day that I die",America,2004

But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just running my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessing my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hit this thinking to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Send the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the gram, they trending Meech home
In the D, my G, he throwing that peace on
Every picture that you post leave comments on each one

I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change but I'm always out, fucking around in the club
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up

Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver
Saying sorry, laying up, way up in your liver
Boss, the red bottom's got you walking funny
Get you an agent, she balling and all she talk is money
Take her shopping, baby boy ain't no salary caps
She get it popping so you better bring battery packs
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than being a perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budget
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

I can break a woman off
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks
Now I'm riding in the goods
Line it on up, guarantee you get served

So I ran and told her
I'm a cash money young'n,
Bird-man junior
Just a president, looking for a minor occurrence

Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make him dizzy
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop

That sassy tempo with that walk,
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me

And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world
And I never thought I would see the day we'd grow apart
And I wanna know...

How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryna say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl, how you not gonna see that I'm hurt?

[Chorus]

Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby 
I, I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby 
I, I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Do you hear me crying?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now you want me like a fitted

Twelve rounds to do it

Round three, I can see
Me and you walking down the aisle
And I know we're young so it'll be a while
Before we doing that 
But my mama got me in trainin'
Gettin' ready for the day 
When I make somebody happy
Said I was done with lovin' 
'Til I found someone like you
Somebody tell me, what was I supposed to do
You put my back against the ropes
No choice but to invose
I gotta give it to you baby

Oh girl, baby I just can't believe
That every time you come around
I start losin' my breath
I'm trippin' ova myself

That you got the best of me

Tell me, what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out 
But every time they fall up in it
They fall out; in and out it again
Tell me, how they gonna know about us? 
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know that we can do it

'Cause it's wil'n out (we got that)

Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that)

'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown
I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

It's crazy how all our friends say that we gone
They still tryin' to figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together, and we don't gotta front
We ain't pretend, girl
And you know a couple of them gone hate

The big mouth bass
On the line
It's time for me to retrieve her
And go git her like a wild receiver
But we don't play no ball
See when we come through
We baby girl gon' BB don't play at all

On the real we need to nip this in the bud
Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hatin' (everybody's hatin')
It feels like they just waitin' (for us to grow apart)
It's just hard for me to do
But baby if I'm your man
I guess I gotta be your man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl, with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl I can't front now

I remember Saturday mornin's
Me wakin' up to momma in the kitchen cookin' to Sam Cook and
I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for momma to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight
My momma always gave a style she knew I would like, and then
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball

Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed
All heads said she was cool, nothing' that she wouldn't do
But about CB, she was know to act a fool (whoawhoa)
With the little money that she made
She took the bed and made it all okay
Night at the daycare, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now

A heart ain't a brain
But I think
That I still love you
A happy endin'

Cause it ends
When you don't want to
And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
How do I explain
This nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin'
That I still love you

It's a fly twist
Just when you said
I got this
Right when the fight
Has stopped it
Seem my body felt wrong
Held on them nights
We held on
We can't let it go
But if we don't then
We will never know

We we said let's not leave on bad terms
In between those bad words
This could be love right?
Uh, huh
But are we gon' leave
When it's this good?
Damnit we just cause
Seems this lovin's

Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,

Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun!

Chris Brown,"I had a problem, I couldn't solve it
He had this flashy diamond smile, but had no soul
I gave him love and I gave him all I had
But when I needed his love back his heart was cold

Well, he told me his love would never end
And he sold me and I bought it once again

Shot down, shot down by lady killer
I should have seen it coming from the start
Shot down, shot down by a lady killer
He took his aim and shot straight through my heart

And then it hit me, saw him for what he was
I had to cut him lose, think fast and that was that
And then I saw him, he asked me how I been
Started beggin', pleading, crying the whole routine

Fooled me, two times
The shame is all on me
It's a nice try but I'm not gonna make it three

You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Uh, use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some

'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
how never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)

No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond

Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better

Back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster

Fuck the dough I get plus the dough I spend

Don't you ever go away
And throw it away

And it's only because of you
I knew it from the very start

No no and the least of my problems today but,

Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldnt've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, 
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh
Give my all, you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (no)
I wish you just fake it for me (fake it)

Aye, what it is world
Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy
Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth

That it ain't what it is, than it hits C.N.N.
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again
Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again

I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou'

So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The bible say let he without sin cast the stone first (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to T.M.Z., the A.J.C. and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope
A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood
Should it overshadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with

You can put my life on that

And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
Fly's I'm is shorty, I'm about to pour this

And you can love me, or you can leave me
Before you judge me, just let me be me
And you can love me or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy",Get Back Up,2010

Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a Frito
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong, you said the drive stick

Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

You a star, I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard in these sheets, I'm a God, Lord,
Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She post it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drink last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

So she done came down
Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong, 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three for you and me

But we should be body to body

Uh, picture your body soaking, bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers
Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels
Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feel
Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty
I was thinking you can ride me, miss Kentucky derby
Why dream about it, let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage
Gotta moan it, damn it, feels good
Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood
Damn right, so unreal

Was that Chanel Five? Very sexy fragrance
Are those your real eyes? Can tell you're partially Asian
But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated
And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest
Body to body, wet as Dasani
Bet if I hit the spot, I'll make you tsunami
Change up the sheets, no time to sleep
Asked her what she thinking, she reply that I'm a beast
Yeah she replied that I'm a beast
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets

Chris Brown,"A hunnid thou, 3 kilos, my chain is illegal
My life a Tarantino, the mall, you in the sequel
It's big dollars fuckin' with this big screen
Shit done got crazy on the side lately, tell her don't scream
Kick it like dojo, know you used to the finer things
Raised from good homes, imagine how that pussy leak
Hood Mona Lis, model for me in that lingerie
Diamonds come rosary, say a prayer then I eat
Downtown penthouse, see the city sleep
R6, bitches still high from last week
Back at it, the routine is automatic
They love my aesthetics, I love they ass clappin'
It's all sex, we do it the best on the West
They say I walk around like I got a ""S"" on my chest
SLR, ordered that bitch comin' tomorrow
King shit dineros, you think we out here fo?

I see you workin' that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryin' to freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome
So tell me girl what you drink?
We gon' have a good time, it's a party (It's a party)
So bring your ass to the Westside

Look, Virginia nigga on a California king size
Pull your panties to the left, let it G slide
Bonnie & Clyde, ride or die
That's what you need right?
Her daddy OG, she grew up on the East Side
Bumpin' and humpin' like it's nothing, feel like a asthmatic
69 her favorite, that's simple mathematics
And she can tell by my eyes I love that ass-clapping
A nigga looking suprised, she got my name tatted
She a fan, fuck any nigga affiliated
Went from drug dealers to sports, this bitch done graduated
But I deal with her, and let her think she made it
I'mma spend it all, shit I'm just playing baby
A 100k for the strippers, just me and my niggas
After that we party with bitches and sippin' on liquor
Inhalate them niggas, let them Tec fly (Shit)
That's how we do it on the Westside

I see you workin' that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryin' to freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome
So tell me girl what you drink?
We gon' have a good time, it's a party (It's a party)
So bring your ass to the Westside

You ready? Just give me a sign, girl
'Cause that body looks amazing, girl
And I'm ready to give you the time of your life, baby
I think you deserve a change
Girl I'm falling in love tonight, my hand up your thigh
I see you don't give a fuck tonight, girl show you right
Let's not waste our time, like it's a 9 to 5
Me and you, both together
Getting freaky on the Westside

And girl I see you, see you workin' that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryin' to freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome

It's a mother out there right now
About to have the next LeBron
Searching for a pot of gold like a leprechaun

Who's next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and
So wooh when it's rappin' time
Y'all don't understand I'm misunderstood

Live even though you dead wrong

Chris Brown,"Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give it up

They wanna hold you back, tell ‘em pee off
Whenever they say you can’t, take the T off
I remember when they told me I couldn’t be famous
Now my dream and reality is simultaneous

And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
And there’s a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don’t do with what you got

Yeah, so get it in go sunny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
The hunger in your tummy

I’m always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don’t believe
I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion

This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the record, no camera’s, forget a quote
Some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I from Virginia where they hang the n-ggas by rope

I used to see my momma getting beat down!
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can’t even see down

Award shows, I poured my heart out
And people still steady trynna point my flaws out
And I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me
But I’m a champion, legend, history

I’m always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said

I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion

Imagine you was the one, that couldn’t get a look in
Couldn’t get a booking
Couldn’t get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
So now they tryna shush him
It’s only you believing in you
They turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But thats how champions move
Yeah so go and get it in sunny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy

Because I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting

""Was she attractive, was she an actress ?""
Baby the fact is, you're hearing rumours about me
And saw some pictures online
Saying things, they got you so angry
Making you wish you were mine
Before we start talking crazy
Saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset

Liquor got you open, closing your blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out of my head

Change your body, need a visor
Car too big, but f*** it, don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
N**** gun, gun down

She want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo-coo, got me f***ed up, f***ed up, wow
You know a n**** ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down

Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)

Your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em, I don't wanna accept the truth
Who the f*** you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?

Sad to see you playing the fool
You don't know half the s*** that a n**** been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it

I call you massaheesa, yeah I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love, and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya
I used to love ya, I think to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage

My life's like Broadway
No cameras welcome to the show
One champ for them boys on dictment
Broadway, negro, I'm poster than post

Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet

That I would point blank y'all

And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know

Hay algo que me gusta de ti
Y ese algo me encanta
Siento que eres necesaria para mí

Me vuelve loco tu pelo, tu boca, tu piel
Tu cintura dura dura eh
Me vuelve loco tu pelo, tu boca, tu piel
Tu cintura dura dura eh

Seguimos acercándonos tú y yo uoh
Sintiéndonos, besándonos
Seguimos acercándonos tú y yo uoh

Ella tiene el flow la diva de club
Su cuerpo me mata y sin miedo me ataca
Por la noche se mete en mi casa y la fiera de adentro la saca
Se mueve se mueve me lleva por la parte oscura me atrapa

Me toca me besa el cuello
La jefa de la tribu ella me saca
Tiene algo que me descontrola me en boba cuando se acomoda
Llegando pa brinca coke con soda
Es fanática fanática de la moda

Pégate llévame al cielo
Rompe el suelo
Falda corta suelte el pelo
Ella sabe a mantecado, vainilla fusión de caramelos

Seguimos acercándonos tú y yo uoh
Sintiéndonos, besándonos
Seguimos acercándonos tú y yo uoh
Sin que nadie nos vea
Disfrutándonos

Señora la reina de la noche
Se mueve me enloquece
Con un flow cacaca caro
Como yo no reparo le dije claro negra vamos al grano
Me preparo, se me pega el descaro rápido como disparo (boom)
Ella me amaga, yo le amago
Ella es la nena buena yo soy el malo

Con ella yo convino, tomando vino
Pido a lo que ha tenido
Su cuerpo asesino multi platino
Fiera cruzate en mi camino
Quieres pasión prendemos el rhino
Tu eres la mami de mi destino
Cuando se mueve maquino maquino maquino

Hay algo que me gusta de ti
Y ese algo me encanta
Siento que eres necesaria para mí

Me vuelve loco tu pelo, tu boca, tu piel
Tu cintura dura dura eh
Me vuelve loco tu pelo, tu boca, tu piel
Tu cintura dura dura eh

I miss your, morning kiss

You know the one, right around the block
From a nice place, that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Care to sit down, let's talk it out

That got me walking 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue wit' 'em when the Lakers on
Other than that I'm getting my Marc Jacob's on
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it'd be a wrap
When I'm riding it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone
'Cause all them bitches is ratchet
And let me get in my truck
'Cause all them' bitches'll catch it
Wait wait wait, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant

Chris Brown,"If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code
But back then couldn't get dro, 'cause back then I was this broke
That's why I got so many hustles, bruh man from the fifth floor
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing
Bare with my y'all, I'm this close
Spent my whole life chasin' chips, where's Nabisco?
My past memories, I miss those
Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for

If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

I'm fresh off my pit stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc
Get shit pop when my shit drop, no hip-hop, this Tip hop
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
'Til you hear me on a B.o.B song, some chick gettin' my skeet on
To touch the sole of my feet, G you gon' have to get your reach on
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly on the ground and I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice, could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call
Beg your pardon, I'm too hard, I disregard what you say
Back up the trunk and pass the buck, here's where I'm stoppin' today
Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away we too ill, ill
That's how we got arenas, domes, and stadiums feel
How you feel?

If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

And I'm still here in a black whip full of strange clouds
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down
Still here for the east side, ain't a thing change but the bank account
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe to toe with your whole squad
With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""Oh God!""
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk
But I always knew I'd go far, like a gas truck with no park
So no applause, hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song

If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how.
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin.
And even scarified your friends over me,
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me.
It's like the same old story out your diary
Memories never fade, but in only time we'll see
Hope to see you with me 'cause

My heart beats, for you, girl you know you are the one.
Why you mad at me? Girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up.
But my heart beats for you baby I'mma go 'head scream it loud.
But if you leave there's something I can't control,
So let's do it one last time, a fuck for the road.

Gripping and biting, remember the times after fighting
You said you love me, I liked it, became obsessed with the sexing.
You screaming “who's is it”, we naked
I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home.
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mines
Said you hoped the feeling's real
Really tired of all the lies.
One minute we fine, then we not
Everything I do you can't but that's no reason for making mistakes
This time put it all on the plate.
Told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you,
You get lonely when I'm touring just hold it down be supportive.
I'll be back in the morning that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it, flaunt it show it.
Ain't the same, better than the rest
And what's real love if you ain't got respect?
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make you understand
Make you understand that

Why you mad at me? Girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up.

So let's do it one last time, a fuck for the road.

All I ever wanted was your happiness,
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business.
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye,
Girl I'm bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my

Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex invest time, Moet it's sex time.
Hard to let go, a part of you gon' be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest
And what's real love if you ain't got respect?
And it's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make you understand

I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry

The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Who are you to be compared with? (Woo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Caught cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces

And I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same
Song that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

It's safe to say you're the only reason for it

I feel safer in your violence

He must be mad with me, it's coming
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'mma hope, I'mma hope so the iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grand, it's ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note, a note that read ""granted, don't you panic""
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act manic, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love? (Do you hear 'em love)
Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me

Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

Or high when you was level

Hate to admit it

But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane
I should've put my focus on you

Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Did it change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while

And you want me just for tonight
Only one night (just for tonight)
(One night, one night) yo

Look at my charm and baby look at my arm (look at it)
You know you the bomb, I'mma call you Saddam (boom)
I don't need your phone number, you coming home
You don't really speak no English baby, where is you from?
Never mind that, hop up in my Coupe and let the top back
Just a night to remember, get your recorder and rewind that
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, baby you the finest
Don't worry about it, it just me and you on Quavo Island
First night, I was styling, I saw you smiling
When I leave the club on four door, I let you be pilot
When I get you to the room you know that I'mma dive in (splash)
On the first night, lil' mama going in

I want you
You want me just for tonight (only one night)
Just for tonight (just for tonight)
I want you baby
And you want me just for tonight
Only one night (just for tonight)
(One night, one night) yo

I want lil' mama, lil' mama said she want young Takeoff
Keep our jet, private jet taking all me to my lake house
Takeoff ain't no superman, ain't no need to bring that cape out
Givenchy my skin is, Versace my sheets when I lay down
I said don't touch what ain't yours, it don't belong to you
Taking a trip to go pick up the sack is what we known to do
Tried to wet up my Mulsanne but it was bulletproof
With them snipers, no binoculars, we looking for you
Got your bitch on my line, she keep calling me
Feel like my shadow when I'm walking, she keep stalking me
Feel like she work for AT&T, she keep texting me
Lil bitty bitch tryna get next to me
Rubbing all in my Jesus piece, tryna hit the weed

I want you
You want me just for tonight (only one night)
Just for tonight (just for tonight)
I want you baby
And you want me just for tonight
Only one night (just for tonight)
(One night, one night) yo

Just give me an hour, I'll be the water to your flower
I beat it, I'm killing it, make the pussy devour
Got me all in your walls, I'm tryna knock down the tower
I'm not really involved with buying gifts and the flowers
She see my diamond it dancing they globing into your water
Like top me off tried to kiss me, fuck that, and call her again, and she lost
It's only for one night 'cause I know that you not really worth it
If I text you tomorrow you gonna be asking for Birkin
Don't be involved in your feelings 'cause offset leaves bitches hurting
I got to use me a condom 'cause I don't want no more Gerber
I'm in the Maybach with curtains, she suck me up like a sherbert
We fucking these bitch with the lights on and we don't fuck under cover

I want you
You want me just for tonight (only one night)
Just for tonight (just for tonight)
I want you baby
And you want me just for tonight
Only one night (just for tonight)
