The Ten Tenors,"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality, open your eyes
Look up to the kies and see
I´m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I´m easy come, easy go
A little high, a little low
anyway the wind blows,
doesn´t really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he´s dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I´ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo, didn´t mean to make you cry
If I´m not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body´s aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I´ve got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don´t want to die
I sometimes wish I´d never been born at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch
Will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning-
very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I´m just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He´s just a poor boy, from a poor family
Spare him his life, from this monostosity

Easy come, easy go
will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go-
let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go -Let him go!
Bismillah! We will not let you go -Let me go!
Will not let you go - let me go
Never let me go, ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no-
Oh mama mia, mama mia
mama mia let me go
Beezlebub has a devil put aside for me
for me, for me

So you think, you can stone me
and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
and leave me to die
Oh baby - can´t do this to me baby
Just gotta get out-
just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, nothing really matters
Anyone can see, nothing really matters-
nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows ...",Bohemian Rhapsody,2002
The Ten Tenors,"Digging the dancing queen
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You´ve come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music´s high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You´re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

You are the dancing queen

The Ten Tenors,"Angel, I hope you underdstand this
Angel, my heart is breaking

Just close your eyes and dream away
To think of me now and every day
And in your heart there

Her life was fading, 
Heavens where she's gone to say
Where she's gone to stay

The Ten Tenors,"I used to believe 
That fate did not apply to me
I used to believe 
That I had rules all of my own
But my perfect world, 
It came crashing down
On the night you went and left me, 
All alone

And now you've gone and left me here
To face the world with heavy tears
Though the earth revolves 
I'm cast in stone
Same old questions of why it had to be
Guess they'll never be resolved 
Now you've gone

And how do I carry on 
Wth shattered hopes and dreams
And how do I carry on living a life of lies
See you took away all my reasoning
On the night you went and left me 
And closed your eyes

And now you've gone and left me here
To face the world with heavy tears
Though the earth revolves 
I'm cast in stone
Same old questions of why it had to be
Guess they'll never be resolved 
Now you've gone

To see your beautiful eyes)

To bid you one last goodbye)

The Ten Tenors,"Come ride old painted horses
Tell me stories of strangers,
When thought lives in a silence
Fear breathes in the unknown
Flee from the shadows, 
Hide from the seasons

Chorus:
Carry me along the way and call my
Take my hand before you fly
Ever living is the question,
Is this where i will stay?
Call my name before you fly,
Ever longing for the answers,
Fearing for failing to know where
My destiny lies.

Climb down from all your highs
So you stand there among them
Bless all the candles that 
See you by.

Chorus",Destiny Lies,2004
The Ten Tenors,"Por una cabeza de un noble potrillo
Que gusto en la raya afloja al llegar
Y que al regresar parece decir
""No olvideis hermano, vos sabes no hay que jugar""

Por una cabeza mete conde un día
De aquella coqueta y risueña mujer
Que al jugar sonriendo el amor que está mintiendo
Quema en una cuerda todo mi interés

Por una cabeza todas las locuras
Su boca que besa borra la tristeza, cama la amargura

Por una cabeza si ella me olvida
Me importa perderme mil veces la vida
¿Para qué vivir? 

Cuántos desegaños por una cabeza
Yo juré mil veces no vuelvo a insistir
Pero si un mirar me lleve al pasar
Su boca de fuego otra vez quiero besar

Basta de gerberas, se acabó la timba
Un final reñido ya no vuelvo a amar
Pero si domingo
Yo me juego entero ¿qué le voy a hacer? 

Por una cabeza todas las locuras
Su boca que besa borra la tristeza, cama la amargura

Por una cabeza si ella me olvida

The Ten Tenors,"Colours streaming through my eyes 
I'm half asleep
I don't know where I am
Scattered voices come 
From nowhere in the deep
I listen and I sometimes understand

Here inside myself I search to find the key
I'm lost until I'm found
Now I'm pushing at the walls I'll soon be free
They'll all come tumbling down

Chorus:
Oooo the Sundance...

Beneath the sun
We are as one
Welcome day
Bring a new way

Celebration as the daylight touches me
And everything is new
Turning eastwards blinds my eyes 
But I can't see
The sun is breaking through

Chorus
OOo the Sundance...",Sundance,2004
The Ten Tenors,"Sometimes it feels like we're always here, 
Though we've never been before,
Another dusk in another town 
By another lonely shore.
I can't remember how we found this place, 
I've forgotten where we are.
We've been driving for a year or more, 
But how did we come this far?

Chorus:
Now I'm lost on Thunder Point, 
I'm a million miles away.
Though I smile and my friends are near, 
It's a lonely time of day.
We stand together yet we stand alone, 
And there's nothing more to say
So we'll listen to the waves 
And we'll think of home 
Till the sea has turned to grey.

I'm always moving, 
I love my life but it hits me now and then...
When I'm home under familiar skies, 
I long to be gone again.

Chorus

Does it feel as if you don't know anything?
See tomorrow and today is all you bring
Still you're on show, this song and dance.
You can take your chances 
But the coin is tossed
And you count the cost,
And you're...

...lost on Thunder Point, 
I'm a million miles away.
Though I smile and my friends are near, 
It's a lonely time of day.
We stand together yet we stand alone, 
And there's nothing more to say
So we'll listen to the waves 
And we'll think of home 
Till the sea has turned to grey.",Thunder Point,2004
The Ten Tenors,"When we're together
We can do just whatever
We don't care what the weather
If the feelings much better
Will we give up? No never!
We will stay TOGETHER

Chorus:
We'll grow together
If we rise up together
We'll be stronger together
For much longer together
And we'll make it together
We'll go on forever...

Life is for living
Taking chances, forgiving
And for dreaming surprises
In the sun when it rises
With the warmth of disguises
We'll live life TOGETHER

Chorus

Hear us, we're singing
there's no message we're bringing
If you listen to our voice
And remember its your choice
We have reason to celebrate
And sing TOGETHER

Chorus",Together,2004
The Ten Tenors,"Looking out across the clouds
Wishing that I could say
What it's like to drift with the wind
That blows all cares away.
I need to find the way away from you.

Looking out across the ocean
Wishing that I could see
What it's like to float with the tide
That gently sets me free.
I need to find the way away from you.
I need to find the way away from you.

I always hear your name, 
In every wave that breaks,
Hear it whispering on the breeze,
Just one word is all it takes.
You never said it'd be easy,
And you never said it'd be fast,
Nothing prepared me 
For how long this pain would last.

Looking out across the trees
Wishing that I could know
What it's like with feet on the ground
And strength inside to grow.
I need to find the way away from you.
I need to find the way away from you.

I always see your face,
It's smiling up in the sky,
When I reach out to touch you,
You laugh as I slowly die.
Already know what I wish for,
But I can't seem to make it come true,
Nothing prepared me 
For how hard it is to forget you.

Looking out at far horizons
Wishing that I could feel
What it's like for me in the future
And if my pain will heal.
I need to find the way away from you.",The Way Away from You,2004
The Ten Tenors,"I have seen a summer day 
That slowly opens like a rose,
Along a quiet road that wanders by 
And I have smiled 
And wondered where it goes.
The gentle winds, the rains that fall,
The tallest tress, 
I'm part of it all.
I have stumbled through the night 
Alone as anyone can be,
Then found a silent valley full of stars 
And in my heart I heard them telling me 
I was home.
I've seen the rugged mountain tops 
And golden pastures on my way,
Now everywhere I go across the lands, 
I stand so proudly in the sun and say,
I am home
The gentle winds, the rains that fall,
The tallest tress, I'm part of it all.
I've dreamed of Eden all my life, 
I find it more and more each day,
Now everywhere I go across the world, 
I stand so proudly in the sun and say,
I am home",World Anthem,2004
The Ten Tenors,"Places, I still remember, places
Those precious times and places
When everything was new

Places, I still can feel those places
Our hearts will never light us
The sky was twice as blue

Places, what's happened to those places
Oh, they have changed forever
I stayed in love with you

Places, do you remember places
When nothing seemed to matter
The boy from Andrews

Passion, wider than any ocean
Timeless as any man
We were chosen, we grew wiser
Every day, every day

Places, do you remember places
When nothing seemed to matter
I'm still in love with you

I'm still in love with you

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And the loving heart will not ever rage
Oh, to see each other again

God will see you
So nice to say
Can you imagine
Heal me on that day

We will have the store of our dreams, my love
I will paint your face on the wheel
And the shadowed world will begin to glow
When see each other again

The Tennesse Two,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do

Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue

And melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts
To see you sit and cry

Why do you run and hide from life?
To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

That you belonged to me

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you

And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, Who called me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise

The Texas Playboys,"My pappy said son you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln

Have you heard the story about the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincoln were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was a drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
And an overdrive that just won't stall

It's got a 4-barrel carb and dual exhausts
4:11 gears that really get lost
Safety tubes and I'm not scared
The brakes are good and the tires are fair

We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We were drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still

Then all of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
But by then the taillights was all you could see

Now the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well I wound it up to hundred and ten
Twisted the speedometer cable hit top end
Had my foot glued right to the floor
I said that's all there is there ain't no more

Now the fellas thought I'd lost all sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots

I took a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and hoped I could pass
But when I did I'd be short on gas

Had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said look out boys I've got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by

Now all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
Down in the depths she started a rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln

They arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pop to throw my bail.
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'

To think about my silly world.
My feet are firmly screwed to the floor.
What is there to fear from such a regular world?

Passing by a cemetery,
I think of all the little hopes and dreams,
That lie lifeless and unfilled beneath the soil.
I see an old man fingering his perishing flesh.
He tells himself he was a good man and did good things.
Amused and confused by life's little ironies,
He swallows his bottle of distilled damnation.
People turn around with unseeing eyes.
They're looking for something that doesn't exist.
The world you once knew is being eaten up by rust.
No-one has time for the past, but still, in God they trust.
The future is now, but it's all going wrong.
Bodies good for nothing, but it's to nothing they belong.
People say prayers and some work hard.
If you give them all your money, they'll give you their hearts.
This town ain't going like a ghost town.
It's going like hell....

Live apart - in order to...survive -
You were emotionally independent -
But starved of affection.
But now you've been trapped by tenderness
& been beaten into ""submission""...

Where could she have got to.
Why is she torturing you -
You roll on your side -
& run your fingers through your hair -
Your scared of losing her -
& facing yourself -
A red sky at night may be a shepherds delight,
But your cutting chunks from your heart.
& rubbing the meat into your eyes.

Your relying on her - for your independence
She can't leave you here - alone & defenseless

I followed that bead of sweat,
To the small of your back,
From the nape of your neck,
Lightin' it up, with every drag upon my cigarette.
It can run, but it can't hide--
Like the unspoken feelings on your mind.
I'm too tense to be tender,
Your too weak to be true.
You try to make it easier upon yourself,
By makin' it hard on you!
But it's the lies in your eyes
That make me wanna cry--
It's just sometimes I get so lonesome
--I could die.
I'm just another western guy,
With desires that I can't satisfy
So all the love I gave to you
Means nothing at all.
Dear God, God, God, this slow train to dawn.
So are you lying when you say you love me.
I'm lying when I say I don't--
We've opened our hearts to let each other look in,
To have and to hold,
But it's the words that remain unsaid,
That are the words I wanna hear you speak,
I bet the birds start singing, & the sun comes up,
Before we fall asleep--
Oh the tears in your eyes, just make me wanna cry,
It's just sometimes I get so lonesome--I Could Die!!
",Slow Train to Dawn,1986
The The,"The rising moon faces the sickening sun,
As the lights in the tower blocks go on, one by one,
A big shot, overlooking this black iron skyline--
Surrounded by his symbols of prosperity--
Sits back in his new leather chair
Ripped off the back of some unfortunate beast.
I'm smiling through my teeth.
Anybody can be a millionaire,
So everybody's gotta try
But by the laws of this human jungle
Only the heartless will survive.
& down there--but for the grace of god
--go I.

The smoke & the steam, & the broken down dreams,
The hope, & the hunger, frustration & anger,
The little drunken lives,--
Driven' through the traffic lights
& away from who they are!

But I've been thinking of you--
In this great city of great solitude.

Crossin' the central reservation, of my imagination,
Searchin' for the world I...left behind.
A shadow hunting shadows of childhood life.
It's all I want--& all I miss--
But how can I return, to a place that don't exist!!

from Mombosa to Miami, Beiruit to Bangladesh,
I've flown around the world standing
On the wing of a jet.
Tryin' to salvage my emotions
From the bottom of the oceans--

why'see I sold my soul, to pay for my dinner.
My stomach grew fatter, but my heart grew thinner,
I ain't foolin' I'm fallin', I wasn't wicked, just weak,
I ain't lyin' I'm dyin', crippled by deceit--

Oh the hand that wrote the agony
Has just begun--
Will be the hand that pulls the trigger
--of this gun!!!

The The,"Suddenly last summer
I started going out of my head
In a tiny hotel room 
Lying naked on a bed
I knew what you were doing
And I knew what you'd done
Your life with me was ending 
Your new life had begun
But I was cursing your name
And I was cursing that room
And I was praying for the strength
To stop loving you

I started writing you the letter
Which turned into the book
I was gonna reach across the ocean
And force you to look
What kind of man was I?
Who would sacrifice your happiness to satisfy his pride?
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind?

Then you came back to me
And I went down on one knee
With a glint in my eyes
And a rose between my teeth
And I pushed out my tongue
For you to see
That I'd been dying of a thirst
For your company
And then you quenched my loneliness
With your tears
And our clothes fell away
As we rolled back the years
But we couldn't deny it
Because we could not admit it
If our love was too strong to die
Or we were just too weak to kill it
Was our love too strong to die?
Or were we just to weak to kill it?

Every moment in that room
I closed my eyes in prayer
Every moment I awoke
I clenched my teeth in prayer

Who would sacrifice your happiness to satisfy his pride?

Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind?

Who could delay your destiny to appease his screaming little mind?

Let the bums count their blessings while they count the money

The The,"Peeling the skin back from my eyes I felt surprised
That the time on the clock was the time I usually retired
To the place where I cleared my head of you
But just for today I think I lie here and dream of you

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out

A howling wind that blows the litter as the rain flows
As street lamps pour orange colored shapes, through your windows
A broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes
Uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out

Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you

All spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day

Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smouldering anger

They’ve all disappeared
Turned around maybe one day
You were all that was there

Stood by unbelieving, stood by on my own
Always thought I was someone
Turned out I was wrong
But you brought me through
And you made me feel so

Blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

Live by an old woman
She'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone
Who won't sing with you

Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart
Never thought I'd miss you
That I'd miss you so much
You brought me through
And you made me feel

So blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

Stand by, stand by, waiting round
(All my life I’m waiting for, someone I could hold the door)
Now that I’m blue, that I'm blue

As I reminisce, oh baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then, all of the sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road 

Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar
Treat every moment that I spent with you
I treasure every like it was a precious jewel
Please, Lord have mercy

Please, come back, baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left
You took all of me with you
Do you wanna hear me scream
Come back and hold me, girl",Distant Lover,1980

Steals across the meadows of my heart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere

I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her

Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

He's got a dream!
I've got a dream!

Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it, dreaming 
Like everybody else
I've got a dream

Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

I have dreams, like you, no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere
Warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!
I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!
I just want to see the floating
Lanterns gleam!

Yeah!

And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower,
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream!

She's got a dream!
He's got a dream!
They've got a dream!

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Burnin trees...burnin trees
Ladies let the music run right through you
Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy

[Chorus]
[Tray-Dee]
I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up
Take this move, this groove and still G it up
Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke
Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast
I'm Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze
Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back
Now let me break it down a notch
Smooth like I do when I pound the cock
We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block
Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot
We so cool now

[Kokane & Goldie Loc]
If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock
We'll make the world pop

[Goldie Loc]
It's too good right now
Blunkey blunkey
Remmey remmey
Plenty gumbo
Snoop gimme some mo'
Swakin that like a damn fool
Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool
there's a lot things that make me want to frown though
But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka
Throwin dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies 'cause they know what's up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin niggaz
I just want to be myself
What I receive from the homies is help
We had a conversation today about who ain't pitchin in
Keep suckas away that don't fit in
I'm so cool

You know, this is an exciting establishment you have here.

I have an Italian cook. Jerome Sa ... Sa ... Sagagagracci or something like that.

Yeah?
.... Yeah!
I know it's rather masculine, but try this one on.
.... Wow!
My God darling, it fits. You must have strong hands.
But they're so soft. Like the oils in my morning bath.
.... (Somebody help me)
Darling?
.... Yeah.
I'm not usually so forward, but ... would you like to make love to me?
.... Hmmm?
I ... I could make it so nice.
Do you know what is meant by the words, uhh...? I hate to use them.
They're ... they're so harsh, so american. You know what I mean?
And yet on the other hand, they're exciting words. The words, Chili sauce

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar. She looked kinda all alone.
So I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said ""How much money you make?""

I said ""How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!""

The Time,"I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do.
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW.
I drove to the party and I pimped on in, just to see what I could see.
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for, I was lookin' for some company.

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar. She looked kinda all alone.
So I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said ""How much money you make?""

Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.

I took her to my crib and I tied her up. I figured that's what she liked.
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, it didn't matter to me. She was white.
I said ""How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!""

It just pisses you off to see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?
Bet you'd rather see me drivin' one of those ester grate ones.
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't you?
Let me tell you one thing. That's dead!
About as dead as you'll be if you don't rearrange your brain.
Catch my drift. Turn it up!

Oh, nasty me!

Girl, you think you want to turn it up? Where's my checkbook?
That's right, check it out. An awful lot of O's, wouldn't you say?

Hit it. Cross over, uh!
Turn it up.

Jerk out, got to make some love tonight.

Don't ya all just hate it, when we walk into y'all's joint?
And just jerk out everything in sight?
Don't it make you mad?
Jerk out, don't it make you mad?
Jerk out, it'd make me mad!

The Time Jumpers,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the nighT
For lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks
Their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself
In the glow of city lights

Lights that say ""forget her name
In a glass of cherry wine""
Lights that offer other girls 
For empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars
To brighten up the night
But the God who put the stars above
I don't believe he made those lights
For it's just a place for men to cry
When things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away
And hide behind those city lights

Lights that say ""forget her love
In a different athmosphere""
Lights that lure are nothing
But a masquarade for tears

I never saw anything, anyone, no one so beautiful
And she would sit around
And wait for the day to end
And she would offer herself as if she had nowhere else to go
And I didn't think nothing of it
And that's when my life went cold
And then she was not sleeping in your bed
And she was all over you
And there she was sleeping in my bed
And then there were all these issues
And then there were all these issues

I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim

And all the things we used to say and used to do together
And I can't believe
That there were such good things between us
And we threw them all away
Just because this girl
She thought that she had something to say
And all the things I'm now left with are scarred upon my mind
And I can't believe all these times I used to wait
And I never used to go out and show myself
Cos I got everything I need
And you need to stop that now
You used to stop me doing what I wanted
And now I can't do it anymore
Cos I discovered there's something about me
That everybody wants some more
That everybody wants some more

And after all that's said and done
I had to
Pick myself up and find myself at number one
Cos this isn't about you anymore
This is all about me
It wasn't your fault that I was living up in a tree
I was waiting for things
I was waiting for things to come to me
We were never in love
And we were never meant to be
All the things that you said
I don't hold you responsible
I needed to get myself together
And that's what've I gone and done
And that's what I've gone and done
And that's what I've gone and done
And now I'm here right now
And my life has just begun

Send all the weak, can't get to prison
I wanna write about setting something free

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs

Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved

Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay

With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,1979

As she dwells out the out door at the left

I see this car there she sits there
And she doesn't even know me anymore

When memories arise
Of a certain song in my head

It makes me think of you
In a spooky mood
With a halo hanging over your head

With the angels you dance, you sing
You told me once before

Now why would you lie to me
When you could set my pain free

Who says that I'm enjoying life?

But the one I found, can't be around
So I'm feelin' down
On that early morning

No joyous times

At a cloud that pays me no mind

Knowing in my heart
That I'm trying to see you
In the bright blue sky, above Tuxedo right?

You'd never wear a suit
Just a sweater and a pair of slacks
And some nice shoes to match

well, in the midst of them, my eyes are full
Cause I'm ready to cry
But I'm not afraid cause I'm a guy

There's no use in waiting for you
In your precious car

Give me feed, let me eat you
Let my wings be so full of you

Into her hands
Clean glands, organs of truth
Hunting for a vision or view

At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes

Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamp

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide,
For little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe""

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live

Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed

To paint that love upon a white balloon,

O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would've drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pulled me out

So the years fed along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished that they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie he knew he was going to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
""We're parting, but you understand""

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,1963

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes

All their hopes
All their dreams

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Have you ever walked the lonesome hills
Or heard the curlews cry
Or seen the raven black as night
Upon a windswept sky
To walk the purple heather
And hear the west wind cry
To know that's where the rapparee must die

Since Cromwell pushed us westward
To live our lowly lives
There's some of us have deemed to fight
From Tipperary mountains high
Noble men with wills of iron
Who are not afraid to die
Who'll fight with gaelic honour held on high

You who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell
For the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers
Whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight

Of one such man I'd like to speak
A rapparee by name and deed
His family dispossessed and slaughtered
They put a price upon his head
His name is know in song and story
His deeds are legends still
And murdered for blood money
Was young Ned of the hill

You have robbed our homes and fortunes
Even drove us from the land
You tried to break our spirit
But you'll never understand
The love of dear old Ireland
That will forge and iron will
As long as there are gallant men
Like young Ned of the hill

[Chorus]









",Young Ned of the Hill,2001
The Tossers,"


I'm going away
But I promise to return some day
But if I don't I promise to remember you
And let us share a drink
So that we can remember
The way things were when friends were here together

Cause our lives are made of memories
And they're all we can take with us
When we leave this place we're in
And as you travel through this world
May your path be long and stony
And may it lead to the most amazing view

I'm going away
But I promise to return some day
But if I don't I promise to remember you
And as you nurse your glass of whiskey
And look out onto the skyline
Think of me and remember the way we were









",Going Away,2003
The Tossers,"


Well oh remember that day, average and gray, you came to me and then
I heard a kindness like a memory I once felt on a passing wind
Oh but the kindness I've known

From street and stone they still resound your presence and animation
No not negation or affirmation, but positivity and creation
Oh but the kindness I've known

Not destruction but creation in the waning hearts you mended
But the spark of connection that fills the soul when simply you're befriended
Oh but the kindness I've known

As well I knew in such freedom grew also isolation
Of the pain of knowing so very few who'ld not desire your captivation
Oh but the kindness I've known

Your love and true and pure desire tireless, endless and sad
I wonder now would I be the same if I'd left what if I had
Oh but the kindness I've known

To discover to the world what I know of you and not unattainable song
That would glorify your attributes like we've done all along
There's a lot more to you than song

and pedistals they cannot describe the torment you've been through
And banishment cannot consummate the frustration and monotony we knew
And song will never ever portray the wonder that you've known
But lyric sticks here like a timeline and it's a mark to show we've gone
Oh but the kindness I've known

So I'll represent this kindness since all else is extoled and present how it does thrive
Like the care and nourishment long forgot in infancy that kept us alive
Lethal environment does not always justify reactionary violent behavior
For striking down malevolence takes it's place and our timeline read the same here
Oh but the kindness I've known

Oh this kindness is what the great search is for not wisdom or divining
Our subconsionce recognizes it's safe guard form birth
To keep our self absorbed frustrated minds from grinding
Oh but the kindness I've known









",Memory,2003
The Tossers,"


I sit alone
I drink alone
I was born alone
I'll die alone
I dream alone
I heal alone
I exist alone
And maybe now that's a lot of alone to put up with

But I like drinking on a Monday mornin'
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday mornin'
Monday morning start anew

Well I been mistreated so my damaged self image
Is what I learned when I believed that what was said was true
Try harder, ya punk, you're an idle underachiever
Maybe so but I'll spite you now I've somethin' to prove
I've taken every behavior and identity on
Because I surely learned to be ashamed of my own
But aggression's not conflict resolution
Even though family, government, society and wrestling tell ya so

Well there's life outside school and your parents garden
So let go of how you learned your defences that way
It's probably you who's being selfish
No one has to stay with you when that's what you say
You take your anxieties out on other people
When you feel their behavior isn't true to you
And chemically on yourself when your damaged self image
Adheres to MacGowan's philosophy and other men's truths


Learning to let go of ideals and other people should be a virtue
Instead of torturing other for life
Never learning, never open, 'cause you've all these conclusions
Just 'cause it didn't work for your parents
No need to force it to work with your wife
Well no one can make me happy or see my side
Cause the anxiety's internal that makes us sad
So reassess addiction to chemicals and chronic wankin'
Well if that's what makes me happy then I've always been sad









",Monday Morning,2003
The Tossers,"


My great Grandpa was a king, a monarch stout and noble.
He surveyed this land so green, and he said ""She's fair and humble"".
As far as the eye can see, from Carrauntooil to Giant's Causeway was ours,
Until they went and made a criminal of me.

Many a Celtic head had rolled, and rolled upon the hillside,
And they bathed their horses hooves in Hibernian blood and their hide.
In exile they did flee, and set up a church and home there,
'till the landlord and the bailiff made it criminality.

Oh, and on the road they came to run, run until the runnin's done.
Run far away from fettered chain, the land was ours to barter.
We succumb from sweat and strain, and look they're right behind again.
If they catch me boys, I know they'll make a criminal of me.

A criminal of me, a criminal of me.
Wandering forever, hungering eternally.

A criminal of me, a criminal of me.
Run, run, before they make a criminal of me.

Across the sea they sailed, to a land both bright and noble.
For they'd watched their neighbors starve, and the bloodline as it fumbled.
As they reached the safer side, ole Papa said to Jimmy,
To try and live a life so they'd not make a criminal of he.

""Go be alert,"" sad Da, ""do not perish for the gentry.""
Tho' poor but proud was he, whenever they called discretely,
Well he'd smash their faces in and in gaol he died poorly.
""But,"" he said, ""don't let them try and make a criminal of ye.""

Oh, now my boss he steps so gay, so gaily up the street,
While I dull the pain in pubs and still can't afford to eat.
He is dashing, he is fancy and he'll never want you see.
Evan as the factory shuts his shoes reflect the criminal in me.

Violent and drunk now in the street with nothing to sustain me,
I'm gonna die here in this hole. The kids I can't take care of with me.
But it must be taught to let the blame and hatred out of their heads.
For anger and danger make you just another pathetic, drunken, violent paddy dead.






",A Criminal of Me,2005
The Tossers,"


We'll live out our lives on this dirty old street,
Only because we just can't compete.
But in the concrete of our younger days, we left our names.

Just like the people before, when they reached
The distant shore with their drink and their dance,
And their dreams and sincere aims.

Ghosts long gone, through old buildings they stare.
With their offspring staring at me for they are still there.
Dreams that are dead and lives not realized.

Why did we write our names in these streets,
To show we're alive?

Well, Chicago is my home and I'll never want to roam,
To live on any sun swept distant shore.
Well, it is where I was reared by forbearers so revered,
And I sing the songs that they all sang before.

Well, any woman that's neared me
Has been repelled most thoroughly.
Still I'm a lover God, I am foremost of all.
A musician that's my call of high degree professional.
But I'm afraid I do not know my trade at all.

And if it's every twenty years
Some small relief to me appears,
Then the crock of gold will wait until that day.

To defend myself no more,
Lay the shield of anger at my door
And the sword of alcohol will stow away.

All the people in our town are overworked and broken down.
Begging cheques but it's just not enough they're giving.
Crying quietly, living life so desperately.
That something has to make this life worth living.

Real life is only a timeline,
And the excitement holds the short times.
It will never measure up to what TV sells as great.
All the drunken jokes and views,
Exciting pubs they tell the news.
But the exciting pats, well, they just weren't all that great.

I met a girl one night and enchantment fixed our sight,
So we decided we would hold it for awhile.
But she would not love me, so inside me finally said,
""It's not your fault.""
But I would like love if only for a while.

Well, it's on and on I've seen, yeah that's how it's always been,
And how it will be as ever on I go.
Oh, but ever on I will.
Through all the banal times until I find some
Place to me that seems like home.






",The Crock of Gold,2005
The Tossers,"Well I met her up on Leeson Street of a Tuesday afternoon
In Summer's fallen colours, sulking back to school
I asked her would she linger, and she asked me would she stay
Would she keep a girl in company, drinking in the day?

Drinking, Drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day

She was almost a woman, she was going on sixteen
She asked me to go walking, In Saint Stephen's Green
She said I love the sunshine, and to hear the children play.
But I won't be distracted when I'm drinking in the day.

With her flashing eyes and milk white lies she looked like a song
Like the ghost of a woman that first made me go wrong
She said I'll have a drink with you but I said you'll have to pay
For a comprehensive education
Drinking in the day

Drinking, Drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day

If her mother could have seen us on that bright November day
Botticelli and his angel perambulating Ormand Quay
A drunken blessed virgin, me rhetorious and gay
Bestowing ancient wisdom as to what made me this way

Well here it is:
Deny your friends and family
To serve you must betray
Break and enter heaven
Well you'll steal but never save
Well you'll squander every penny
And you'll empty every heart
And you'll travel every darkened road
You'll never finish what you start
And you'll always talk to strangers
And make love with whom you may
For God will find good company
For your drinking in the day

Drinking, drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day

So spend your youth on poetry, and spend your cash at play
Every line upon my face is for a girl who went away
A kiss, and a song, are fleeting things and fame will always stray
So I'll tell the truth, the best spent youth, is the one you throw away

Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day

Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day

Drinking, drinking

It's three o'clock at the end of the day.
It's three o'clock in the morning gray.
I'm alone and I'm very, very worried.

All the bottles of wine have ravaged my mind.
Another day's gone by and I'm worried.

And the night, and the night, it is bitter and short.
For I know that a new day is coming.
Another day, another day, all alone and blue.
But for you I've pursued nothing.

I dropped out of school to dwell on a dream,
And now all that guilt is engulfing me.

I can't concentrate, I'm failing.
Oh, were can she be?
I'm alone and I'm very, very worried.

I know that I've always felt this way.
God, I know that it's always been this way.
Since I was young, I've always felt this way.
Well, do I fuck myself for the consistency?

I know that I have stumbled, and I know I've not been sharp.
And when I'm leaving this world behind,
I won't bring another soul here to fall flat on their face,
Or leave this world unkind.






",I've Pursued Nothing,2005

There's not a sound, so it's time for me to dream.

So far away from where I was weaned.

There was a girl so long ago,
All through the park at night we go.
All just as late as it is now,
Two discontented, a young one's vow.

I'm here for you, only to adore you.
You mean everything to me.
And you're with me wherever I go,
And I miss you everywhere I go.

Well, goodbye to old friends,
I watched you go.
From where I sit now, I still say hello.
All the memories gone by, those that I couldn't call.
An eternal divide, the distance too long.

Dead as a mackerel.
Dead as a door.
Dead as a nail, but never a bore.

Always good for a shout.
Always good for a memory when the lights are out.",Late,2005

There's no loot, there's no booze, and it's no fun.

Oh, Dee Dee Ramone where have you gone?
In misery all day long, to shoot some dope right into your arm.
Oh, the sun does rise, the birds do sing.
They fly around and shit on me.
There's nowhere to go.

No loot, no booze, no fun.

God, there's nowhere to sleep, nothing to do,

Nowhere to go, belonging to no one.

""Out on the road, it's dark and it's cold,""
Said my mother as she passed by.
""You'll never stick it long enough.
You're a fool to even try.
You've gone off with a band of men, all addicts, skites, and bums.
So you think you will enjoy your life in the tenancy and the slums.""

Tur ra la, tu ra la, tu ra la, li.
Out on the road is where your Uncle died.

And there's no place that I'd rather be.
So, you think this life will engulf me?
Well I'll tell you we'll just wait and see.

With five bottles of Bushmill's and two on my chair.
We set out for the county Clare.

And it's Ceili's jigs and booze in Killrush.

And I won't come back 'till I've made my name,
Until I have had my fill.

In the park I sat down withy my love,
And not a thing was wrong.
The sun shone down from above,
And not a thing was wrong.

And I go to where our voices paired,
And leapt from off the stone.
And that's the voice that I still here whenever I sing alone, alone.
Whenever I sing alone.

Not many a thought did I abide,
Nor was I help when things went wrong.
At the cemetery by your graveside,
Now everything is wrong.

Well I know exactly where I'm going,
And God knows who I adore.
Tho' my prayers did ask to take my pain,
I wish I could've taken yours much more.

Gathering by day and night.
By the hearth in wintertime,
Gathering just to say goodbye.

So to my thinking we'd best be drinking

Was far outshone by the lillies guise
But hard winds harden both field and garden

So, lads and lasses, because life passes
Come fill your glasses for another round

Last night I lay all in my dreams, when a rap
At the door it startled me.
And I heard those footsteps on the stairs,
And I bade her; please come in.

Come in, come in, my roving friend.
Come in and rest awhile.
For you've been gone so very long,
It's nice to see you smile.
Come in, come in, my wandering friend.
Accept my welcome home.
I hope you can stay a long, long while before you have to go.

And she walked across the room to me,
And then she sat right down with me,
And told me that she had to leave.
She could not stay for long.

A child he held in his arms, a child that I
Knew well through time, and told me that he had to leave.
He had to take him home.

She crossed the floor and moved away,
And my heart said, ""Stop her. Maker her stay.""
But I just showered myself in tears, for I just let her go.

When I awoke I cried and cried,
And went to sit by his graveside,
And visit the child he left behind.
Because he had to go.

You must come back to me again.
Accept the welcome I extend.
I will not let you go this time,
If only in my dreams.

And yeah, though you walk ever on,
May your heart be not weary but strong.
And yeah, though you walk ever on,
Through the valley of the shadow of death.

The right thing to do?
Is this the time for a start
Just for me and you?

I would do anything
Just to see you smile
Just like the sunflowers in my mind

It tangles you up inside... turns your world upside down

The answer is simple... there's a reason my earthly heart burns

Come on, come on, love me true

And he's shifting like shifting like he was dead
And he's hearing something, she never said
On his way back home, under his bed

When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down

In the night there's a girl who doesn't mind her ragged sleeves
Knowing someone soon is gonna grieve
And a man he tells her a story, she just won't believe
Called ""Adam never could do right by Eve""

And the weight comes down
And the weight comes down
And the weight comes down
Down on you, down on me
And a girl walks by the burning bush
She asks ""what's going on here man?""
And he smiles, says ""open wide, wide, wide""

In my dreams, a candy coated train comes to my door
With a little girl, I can't have anymore
You know a letter washes up to the shore
That I cannot read and I probably should ignore

The Tragically Hip,"I'd been carving you
To see what form you'd take
You were hiding in ivory
I just wanted to free you shape

Bringing me down, its too quiet to breathe
Who wants to hear their heart beat?

It's gotta be here
In your spider-web alphabets
Did I read it all wrong?
Or have I just not gotten it yet?

You got what you want. You wanted release.
Can you be appeased? Can you bring it all back to me?
Bring it all back to me

Bringing me down, the obvious turned out to be true
All that I couldn't see, how it was turning me on
I don't want to pare you down
No, I don't want to wear you down
I don't want any more than what's here
No, I don't want to pare you down

Well you got what you want. You wanted release.

September seventeen
For a girl I know it's Mother's Day
Her son has gone alee
And that's where he will stay
Wind on the weathervane
Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain
For a boy in Fiddler's Green

His tiny knotted heart
Well, I guess it never worked too good
The timber tore apart
And the water gorged the wood
You can hear her whispered prayer
For men at masts that always lean
The same wind that moves her hair
Moves a boy through Fiddler's Green

Oh nothing's changed anyway
Oh nothing's changed anyway
Oh anytime today

He doesn't know a soul
There's nowhere that he's really been
But he won't travel long alone
No, not in Fiddler's Green
Balloons all filled with rain
As children's eyes turn sleepy-mean
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain
For a boy in Fiddler's Green",Fiddler's Green,1991
The Tragically Hip,"We wake up different, rifle through our dreams another placid day, ripples at the seams

Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right? 
Or cause I don't want to fight? 
So tangle-minded then so becalmed it's all so Subway-grim and then it's gone

Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right? 
Or cause I don't want to fight? we get so weary, 
Taking fish off hooks it's not as effortless as it may look

Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right? 
Or cause I don't want to fight? 
We lay down seething, smell our pillows burn and drift off to the place where you'd think we'd learn

His bride of the northern woods
