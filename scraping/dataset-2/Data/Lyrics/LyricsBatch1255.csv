Vision of Disorder,"Vision awake
I'll try someday, vision, is okay.....
V.O.D., for all my boys
V.O.D., for all my friends,
V.O.D., for the enemies,
you shall fall.
Time and time again, you've respected me,
time and time again, you've rejected me,
time and time again, with consistency,
time and time again...
So stand for yourself,
one time in your life just stand for yourself.
Vision of Disorder coming straight for your face,
straight for your face...
Choke, you choke, Jesus Christ you beg for? ",Choke,1999
Vision of Disorder,"Don't play, this is your ending
Don't you see, can't someone help me?
Broken body now I piss out a machine gun..well
The inside
Something inside has died
It feels like death in my side
And you know what you did, what you changed, what you broke
Hope you find your descrete jesus a pope
I sleep alone at night, tell myself everythings alright
Whenever you wonder (holler) (it opens)
About you I've lost it (i love you) shine
Bullshit the precious scandal
Time to change out of anger
Open up the fans and you give me away, I said
I said you open up to me
Now I roll back my shell
And I love these deserts even?
And you know what you did, what you changed, what you broke
Hope you find your discrete jesus a pope
Won't something set me free.



",In the Room,1999
Vision of Disorder,"Watch Out! 
Life's hard,
Be strong,
Reform 
Your mind to be pure,
Inspect your action.
Unpredictable is this life that we all lead,
It's our right,
Indestructible a fallacy,
Indestructible denied
We are all but fractions of society...
Hypocrisy...
Democracy...
Down...Up
Kicked in
Burnt out,
Forced out without cause.
Please try hard and fight your way through this life,
Just remember what I've said.

",Watch Out,1999
Vision of Disorder,"Awake to mindless raping. 
Life is going by. 

Now days are complicated, 
Why to be so jaded. 
Every single mother-fucker seems to want a piece. 
I'll shed my skin. 

Chorus: 
No shame. 
Get paid. 
You know your sun is shining. 

I don't keep my mind on cocaine. 
Why be so jaded. 
Every single mother-fucker seems to want a piece. 

Now I got my feet back on the ground. 
Got my head out of the clouds. 
Every single shallow person wants a chance to speak. 
I'll shed my skin. 

Chorus: 
No shame. 
Get paid. 
You know your sun is shining. 

I've got a taste to defeat you. 
You better watch your step 
I'm gonna beat you. 
I'll put you through what I've been through. 
So what's up. 

Chorus: 
No shame. 
Get paid. 
You know your sun is shining. 

Give me the shot.
",Sunshine,2001
Vision of Disorder,"You walk under twilight. 
Reborn into moonlight. 
So easily we're chosen. 
So easily unwoven. 

Jesus came that morning. 
Jesus gave no warning. 
I feel strange. 
I don't remember anything. 

Chorus: 
I've been walking the line. 

Jesus came that morning. 
Jesus gave no warning. 
I feel strange. 
I don't remember anything. 

Chorus: 
I've been walking the line. 

We all transcend, 
To a bitter end. 
To silent grooves. 

To other lives, 
Under skies of granite stone. 


",Walking the Line,2001
Vision of Disorder,"Strung out all the time and I never look old. 
Bent out of my head I gotta get on the phone. 
Downtime is gone and I've been living obscene. 
Where I lay my head I know I'll always be free. 

I never really got. 

Chorus: 
Head over heels. 
I ran. 
Without you I'm all over. 

Out of my head. 
You take up all my time I never really get rest. 
Once your gone you know you can never come back. 
Smoke up all the shit put you back on track. 

Chorus: 
Head over heels. 
I ran. 
Without you I'm all over. 

Tired strung out pressured 
Is all that I feel. 

Should've medicated after all these years. 
For what reason. 

Head full of acid and the highway is wide. 
Follow blurry headlights into the night. 
Once you got out you really got on your own. 
I blew my head out man now I got no place to go. 

Chorus: 
Head over heels. 
I ran. 
Without you I'm all over.
",Without You,2001
Visionaries,"[ VERSE 1: LMNO ]
At a standstill, frozen
Posin' for a portrait, framed with guidance
Three-pronged like a trident
Try it in a 'port, report the second hand smoke
Rumors are contagious
Some of the things heard are truly outrageous
Age put the rage in us, who's this pagin' us?
Uphold maintenance to avoid rust
Simplify competitive complexities
I beg for forgiveness - please
We share to uplift this round square
We're not one, beat the drum without a care
Don't you dare chat to me in that manner
Different territory, different type of grammar
Bond family, no relationship to Bammer
Number one mover and shaker of a tackle
You're uneven, you need more spackle
Bitin' like a jackal, snap, crackle and pop
Slung herbs to this cop, didn't do it a lot
Once it's off the lot it depreciates
Motor mile stop revvin for the pedestrians
State your full name, answer questions
Take all this as suggestions

[ CHORUS ]
Days are limited
Look at life, how you're livin' it
Got the solution, apply
Worthless information, lie

[ VERSE 2: LMNO ]
Why fear Armageddon
When there's eternal life in heaven
Get that overhaul, get the engine revvin
Play the wall at the Gavin convention
Dead-end your ego like vehicle
People, it's repairable plus fareable
Elementals terrible
The only way they'll get five mics from the Source
Is a t-shirt, be hurt
Inadvertenly dominary
Whenever there's a turntable I'ma be heard
Preferred Visionary, wha-wha-wha-wha
Got your attention like TV
I place no value on shock, rock for you to see
Check the policy, honesty is a rarity
Include me in a ( ? ) theory
Clearly not overnight I ( ? ) man
Excellent a walk in the park, Cali accent
There's always room for improvement
Done it before they do it
Do it bits and pieces
All releases increases
Canadian currency
Currently a blessed MC

[ CHORUS ]",Stand Still,2000
Visions of Atlantis,"Barrier of glass, filled with my tears
Empty space, just no one to hear
Walk alone, I can't get clear 
Of those few seconds

Wilted heart, shattered with pain 
Spring will never lead me astray 
No one's able to fan my flame
Condemn myself

If I had just been able to say I'm sorry
Don't go away, live by my side
Because without you life is Grey 
And even sun won't light my day

But now it is too late
All those lines are delayed
You'll never cross this street again
You're out of sight

In my dreams I see your face
Every moment seems like whole days
I can't clean up my disgrace
And those few seconds

If I had just been able, to say turn round
Don't go, please stay, stay with me my dear

If I had just been able to say I'm sorry
Don't go away, live by my side
Because without you life is Grey 
And even sun won't light my day

But now it is too late
All those lines are delayed
You'll never cross this street again
You're out of sight
I will ever be the one to blame
Last shut of your eyes.

Ferries guide you
Guide you all along
Ferries guide you away on silver waves

Crying heaven turns in seas of tears
Ferries guide you
Guide you out of sight",Last Shut of Your Eyes,2005
Visions of Atlantis,"I see her face in my dreams like a star shining all across the sea
I remember this moment, years ago there was only you and me
When I wake up in sadness I realize my deep wounds never heal 
Living only in memories, all is lost, coldness I can feel

Sky turned darker and darker, soulless voices whispering her name 
End came closer and closer, endless sleep was sweeping in her veins

She faded away like a rose on a Winter day
I remember her last words, please don't cry for me

[Chorus:]
Lost in endless night, take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light, when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me all across the raging sea 
Together we will be, when will I ever be free

One night I was dreaming, seemed to me like reality, so clear
A fallen angel inside me, speaks to me, tells me what has to be done
There's a fire in my heart burning bright like the glory of a king
For too long I was waiting, now my soul is flowing in the wind

She faded away like a rose on a Winter day
I remember her last words, please don't cry for me

[Chorus x 2]",Lost [Video][*][Multimedia Track],2005
Visions of Atlantis,"Walk through darkened shrines
Sadness's my guide
My night has come
Loneliness's my friend
My self - built land
Until the end

Rain clouds, darkness, coldness - I'm satisfied
Hate and anger, fear is my guiding light
Hear me screaming,
Crying your name up to the sky
Hope for your sign, send me a light 
Rescue my soul, set me free

Send me a light 
Out of my night

Lay your arms on me
To set me free 
My fear is me 
Take my hate away
Let pain astray
Show me this way

Night falls, dark dreams, blackness comes over me
Endless sorrow, this is what I can see
Hear me, help me, your love could set me free
See me bleeding, don't go away - leave me
alone, in my night

Curse the darkness, for I can free my loul
Freedom calls me, I won't be left alone Dreaming your dreams, could be reality
You are my dream, see what I've seen and come
with me, into light

Send me a light
Out of my night",Send Me a Light,2005
Visitor 42,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,2002
Visqueen,"I'm sorry that you're falling apart
Falling apart, falling apart at the seams

I'm sorry that you're losing your heart
Losing your heart, heart and your dreams

The last to know
You are",Last to Know,2003
Visqueen,"Missing you tonight
Since you took that flight
Because baby we're so tight

You and me
We're mutual like Omaha
Fingerprinted, dusted the same
You and me, we're mutual like Omaha
Thick as thieves, bound by one chain

Something feels so right
Get on a plane tonight
Because baby I've drawn the line

You and me
We're mutual like Omaha
Fingerprinted, dusted the same

You and me, we're mutual like Omaha",Omaha,2003
Visqueen,"You're kidding yourself
If you think you can find
The fractures in my mind

You're sinking like a stone as he hangs up the phone
And the red's all you've left over

When sunsets last too long
Another arctic heartbreak song
When your waves upon the ocean, and your
Paint's another potion turns you blue

Blue

When children come back home
Another city's own
And you mixed the blood on southside

You try to see things through, but no one comes for you
When you're busy running traces
Instead of tying up your laces
You'll be blue

Blue

Come what may, try to discover
Unlocked hearts to throw away
You're kidding yourself if you think you can find primaries

The song can write itself
Dear someone help me love myself
Gun the fun down little soldier
When his arms reach out to hold her
You'll be blue

Blue",Blue,2004
Vist,"Scheiße das is wohl das Ende meiner Träume,
So eine verdammte Kacke ich habe verschlafen
Warum hat mein beschissener Wecker nich geläutet,
Jetzt muss ich raus aus den Federn und ins Bad renn
Schwitzte im Schlaf habe Achselnässe,
Es bleibt keine Zeit für eine Katzenwäsche
Wenigstens ruckzuck die Zähne geputzt
Und Reste werden runter durch die Kehle geschluckt jupp
Jupp, die suche nach reinen Klamotten lässt mich 
leider zu der Annahme kommen ich habe nur noch dreckige Sachen
Dabei habe ich doch vor nicht all zu langer Zeit 
meiner Mutter aufgetragen sie hätte meine Wäsche zu waschen
Ja, na gut, ich gerat in Wut und zerdepper im Badezimmer die Armatur
Hey, Ist es Verzweiflung oder wahrer Mut?
Denn ich verlasse meine Wohnung im Schlafanzug
Schnell die Mappe gesattelt bin in totaler Aufruhr
Renne hin zur Treppe durch den Hausflur
Nehme dabei wohlwollend einen Sturz in Kauf,
Bewältige die Treppe per Purzelbaum
Ja man könnte behaupten ich habe Pech,
Doch muss ohne zu gucken über die Straße renn
Aber mein Scheißbus der fährt mir vor der Nase weg,
Alter ehrlich dieser Tag ist Dreck

So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
Kann man da von Schicksal reden? 
Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Befinde mich immer noch auf dem Schulweg,
Den ich zu Fuß geh, mir tut der Fuß weh
Aber ganz egal wo der Schuh drückt oder Blut spritzt,
Heute komme ich nich zu spät
Hasse das Leben jetzt prasselt der Regen,
Ich hätte alles und jeden für eine Jacke gegeben
Es ist nass auf den Wegen
Und zu allem Überfluss bin ich in Kacke getreten
In einer Vielzahl, ganze vier mal, ja sogar an beiden Füßen
Sowas soll Glück bring'? alle Passanten gaffen mich an 
und denken ich würde in scheiße wühlen
Typisch, zu einem verkorksten Tag,
Gehört natürlich auch dazu passendes Regenwetter
Sollte das hier alles nie ein Ende haben
Und so weitergehn dann schick mir besser einen Seelenklempner

So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
Kann man da von Schicksal reden? 
Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Es war ein bitterer Tag (jaja) an dem ich um Erlösung bat
Ich habe das Gespür dafür, dass die Kacke, die ich heut erlebt habt nicht einmal die Krönung war
Dank meiner Vorliebe für Schokolade und fettem Essen
Is der folgende Weg ein einziger Kraftakt
Die Bewegung tut mir gut, verliere sieben Kilo unterwegs und drei Liter Wasser
Immerhin ein positiver Nebeneffekt,
Doch ich nehme wieder zu in Genen ist Fett
Ich möchte nicht mehr weiter durch die City rasen,
Ich möchte ein bisschen schlafen also bitte gebt mir ein Bett
Doch der Battleboi ist dick und muss
Weiter gegen die Zeit laufen bis zum Schluss
Eins hast du über mich nicht gewusst
Ich muss unbedingt in die Schule, bin pflichtbewusst
Irgendwie versuch ich klar zu komm,
Spring über Bänke auf denen die Penner pennen
Danach über Geländer renne so wie ein Beserker
Und überhole die Rentner die mich währenddessen anmeckern
Doch ich höre da nicht hin ich habe anderes im Blick
Die Vordertür von meiner Schule is erreicht mit einem Schritt
Aber ich könnte weitermotzen die Vordertür ist verschlossen
Es is Sonntag all die Mühe war umsonst",Verschlafen,2013
Vit Fiala,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1997

On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in a roam
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever

I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up
  
Seem like y'all niggas ain't never gon' learn
Either you hitting, or the nigga getting hit
'Cause son, when I click and cock, my shit gon' pop
And never been, a small nigga 
Always a score nigga
That be up in your braud nigga 
You fraud nigga
Cop yae, from far, but never raw niggas
My A's and SK's will rob when it's war nigga
Product and money
So if you want fifteen, it's twenty
And if you less than ten, I won't bend
Or y'all niggas to run with it
Gun busting, I done did it
And anything else that come with it
You don't want it
If it's real, put the deal on it
Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
  
Another question: Is you willing to die 
Just as much as you want to kill?
  
I went from handcuff recovering 
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling
All my checks doubled in
Fuck tussling
Word to God
Got a hundred men, with guns and tems
And we love Mack-10's
Since the sex, got a nigga blushed with me
Got a nigga wet
Dropped the lex 
Copped the tech
We cashing checks, son
We out to get the decimals
Don't know about the rest of you
You fucking with professionals
Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating 
To see Satin
Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' hoe, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first
  
Niggas respect murder everywhere
It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder
  
Nigga, it's so hard to say good-bye
I wonder why
Take a sneak peak kissing herbs on a high
Hah, I'm down for whatever, whenever
Murderers stick together
See Vita, be that chick to hard throb you nigga 
Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female
  
Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
  
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat
To lift you off your feet
The riding suite
But when it's time to eat, the guns come

And when my pop's was sleep you snuck in the back door
Baby boy, we've been down since junior high
So when life gets hot in July it's the world against you and I

Be ballin' tied together and never
Part from the heart knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

What would I be without you?
(What would I be without you?)
I only think about you
(Oh, what you're sayin' is true)

I know you're tired of bein' lonely
(I need someone to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me

I know you're tired of bein' lonely
(Yes, I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear baby, I won't cry
And you know that my heart don't lie
If you leave me lonely 'cause you not just my love you my homie

Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control hold me, my love 'cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours

Baby
A thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady

Feelin' you baby 'cause them eyes ain't lyin'
Wash away all them tears there'll be no more cryin', baby
And you complete me and I would die if you ain't with me

On top of a high hill
Cause my nigga ain't tryin to run up then I will
Hit it from behind that's how I polly wit mines
Man we up all night fuckin by the Hollywood sign
Yea got smacked up
Everytime she backed up
Didn't know there was room in the back
Of the lack truck
I pass her the job then he
Passed it back
Hope my girl to find a magnum raps
You need a shoe shine job
The way you polish a knob
Backstage panties down eat dick
Good-bye Biotch

Faut pas que tu paniques, j'te jure ton mec assure, ton mec assume, Vi' ouais
Ton mec est pur, il te trompe pas, j'en suis sûre

Non mais tu n'sais pas toi, ça fait deux mois que j'sens son odeur (quoi?)
Qu'elle laisse des messages tous les quarts d'heure (mais non!)
J'ai infiltré son répondeur (mais non!)
Mon mec se tape une autre femme ouais

- Et tu sais quoi d'elle, t'en as la preuve formelle?

Elle s'appelle Andy, fille de la nuit, elle a un mec qui vit sur Saint-Denis
J'ai pas fini : je les ai vus ensemble mardi
Et je suis sûre que là tout de suite il est avec elle
J'ai même l'adresse de l'hôtel

J'étais à côté de la plaque, je croyais que ton mec était intact moi
Pas de trucs bizarres, pas de plans drague, pas de pétasses
Je croyais que ton mec était à part, qu'il parlait mariage et appart'
Prends ton sac, l'adresse de leur rencard et viens on va les voir viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (calme toi Vi' ca va aller)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (vas-y gare toi là)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

Ok reste discrète, donne-moi le cric, la bombe lacrymogène
Vite, donne-moi une clé, donne-moi sa plaque
Que je la raye sa BM, que je la crève sa BM
Que je la saigne comme il te blesse sa BM
Si tu savais comme j'ai la haine là

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (Vi viens sort de la voiture viens!)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (mais si viens)
Tu crois quoi? Que j'veux pas?
(J'ai demandé c'est la chambre 203, mais si on va monter viens!)
J'y arriverai pas (Ok c'est au 2ème étage)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

- Vas-y tape
- Ouais 2 secondes, j'arrive

Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là?
J'te croyais chez ton père mais tu te fous de moi
J'ai toujours été droite et j'vivais pour toi
J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi
Et toi t'oses baiser cette chienne

- Mais calme-toi chérie, calme toi
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe là, qu'est-ce qui se passe bébé? Mais qui c'est elle?

Mais ferme ta gueule toi
Et si tu veux parler s'teuplaît rhabille toi
Franchement t'as pas d'honneur, t'as pas honte de toi?

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa
C'était bien son cab', c'était bien lui chambre 203
Vitaa, c'était bien ton gars dans les bras d'une petite pétasse
Garde garde le sang-froid, ce bâtard n'est rien sans toi
Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ
Regarde-moi après les drames que j'ai vécus, j'y croyais plus
Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)

Tu sais j'ai peur moi (vas-y gare toi là)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

Ok reste discrète, donne-moi le cric, la bombe lacrymogène
Vite, donne-moi une clé, donne-moi sa plaque
Que je la raye sa BM, que je la crève sa BM
Que je la saigne comme il te blesse sa BM
Si tu savais comme j'ai la haine là

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (Vi viens sort de la voiture viens!)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (mais si viens)
Tu crois quoi? Que j'veux pas?
(J'ai demandé c'est la chambre 203, mais si on va monter viens!)
J'y arriverai pas (Ok c'est au 2ème étage)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

- Vas-y tape
- Ouais 2 secondes, j'arrive

Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là?
J'te croyais chez ton père mais tu te fous de moi
J'ai toujours été droite et j'vivais pour toi
J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi
Et toi t'oses baiser cette chienne

- Mais calme-toi chérie, calme toi
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe là, qu'est-ce qui se passe bébé? Mais qui c'est elle?

Mais ferme ta gueule toi
Et si tu veux parler s'teuplaît rhabille toi
Franchement t'as pas d'honneur, t'as pas honte de toi?
Prends ton string et casse-toi
Les filles comme toi ne méritent pas plus qu'un petit bout de trottoir
(Mais Mélanie, arrête)
Mais ferme ta gueule toi aussi, regarde-toi t'es en calçif' putain
Tu fais le mesquine mais tu viens de briser mon amie, oh
T'es pas un homme t'es qu'une victime
T'as un problème avec ton slip ou quoi?
Putain vas-y Vitaa, on se casse d'ici viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (arrête de pleurer, s'il te plaît)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (viens ma puce viens)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (rentre dans la voiture viens)

Non mais je rêve Mel
Je l'ai pas vu avec elle et c'était pas sa BM
Non c'était pas cet hôtel

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa
C'était bien son cab', c'était bien lui chambre 203
Vitaa, c'était bien ton gars dans les bras d'une petite pétasse
Garde garde le sang-froid, ce bâtard n'est rien sans toi
Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ
Regarde-moi après les drames que j'ai vécus, j'y croyais plus
Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)
J'ai le numéro de ton gars

Je vais le faire pour toi

Vitaa,"Combien de temps encore, combien d’efforts 
À tenter d'éviter les pièges? 
Combien de temps encore, à faire semblant
A gâcher nos espoirs?
Moi j’ai laissé les miens pour ça
J’ai la musique à fleur de toi
Je suis prête à me battre encore si ça ne suffit pas
Qu’on leur plaise ou pas, nous on reste là

Combien de fois, dois-je leur prouver qu’suis un artiste?
Combien de fois dois-je leur dire que ma musique existe?
Et qu’elle mérite un respect à la hauteur de nos prises de risque?
A la hauteur de nos ventes de disques
Ils peuvent toujours venir me barrer la route
Face à eux j’ai la foi comme Moïse devant la Mer Rouge
Qu’ils sachent que j’lâche pas, que j’m’acharne
Et qu’on peut pas mettre des bâtons dans les roues d’un char non!

Plus d’une fois, j’ai écouté, j’ai laissé faire
Plus d’une fois, j’ai préféré me taire

Des tubes, des tubes, le temps de noyer ma plume
Le voilier, qui leur permet d’aller voir l’horizon
Qui leur permet de ne pas perdre la raison
Pour eux j’avance de mes propres moyens
Car je sais que votre soutien est tellement chaud qui tend la main
Donc je joue mon rôle sans faire le comédien
Car j’ai promis aux miens de le faire à la bien cousin

Moi j’essaie, d’avancer, si tu les écoutes, tu mets ta vie de côté
Sans jamais t’emporter, sinon espoir est mort je vais y resté
J’ai besoin d’exister, avec vous sans leur aide (Oh non)

De ce parfum si différent du tien

Comme si j'étais ma propre prisonnière
Ça fait bientôt un an qu'il m'a sauvé de toi
Souvent je me demande où j'en serais pour toi
Souvent je me demande ce que tu fais, où tu es, qui tu aimes

Lui, il a tenté de me consoler
Même si il n'a pas tes mots ni ton passé
C'est vrai mais il n'a pas ton goût pour la fête,
Pour la nuit, pour les autres, pour tout ce que je hais
Il a séché toutes mes larmes, tu sais
Il a ramassé tes pots cassés
Et il a réglé tous tes impayés, tes impostures, tes ratures
Tout ce que tu m'as laissée
Il m'aime comme un fou et me connaît par cœur,
Il me dit je t'aime parfois durant des heures
Mais il ne sent pas ton odeur

M'a rejoint sans préavis, et désormais ma vie c'est
Pénétrer son monde et sa vie
Pour qu'il me vois je suis prête à donner
Tout ce que j'ai, ce que j'ai acquis
Pour qu'il revienne enfin comme si j'étais
Celle qui manquait à sa vie
Sans qui le goût des choses ne lui viendrait
Pour qu'il me reste je ferais tout, tout car c'est toi

Le séduire, sans y laisser ma vie
Qu'il me voit sans trop m'exposer
Qu'il rêve de moi comme moi la nuit
Oui, voilà l'homme que je cherchais
Qui me regarde puis disparait
Sans savoir saisi mon cri
Reprend sa route et m'oublie
Comment lui dire qu'il me plait ?
Sans lui faire peur, je ne veux pas qu'il s'enfuit
Pourquoi les autres m'effraient ?
Sans raison claire c'est lui que j'ai choisi
Je veux qu'il sache que je fais
Tout ça pour qu'il entre enfin dans ma vie
Et même si ça lui déplait
Il s'y fera car moi c'est

Toi et pas un autre que je veux mais toi

Hay tantas cosas que quiero decirte
Pero cada vez no me miras

Et le ciel gronde, veut faire chavirer ma barque
À croire que Cupidon s’est empalé avec son arc
À bout de souffle, notre relation manque d’oxygène
Forcément quand ça dérape, c’est l’un ou l’autre qui gène
J’en garderai que des souvenirs, des bons, des mauvais
Au fond s’qui m’plaisait, c’était ta façon de m’aimer
Même pas le temps de crier ""Mayday!""

You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back

The bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death

The horse, he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Gazed into the eyes of the king
See the Heavens sky in malice
Awakening strength of one million warriors
Raising their swords to overthrow the pure

Destruction of your hero's kingdom, the walls begin to fall
The swords of pandemonium, a millennium of bloodshed

Condemned to the impure air, blood running black
Victory clouds form, can you smell the sulphur?

Recurrent waves of sorrow abolished by the sword
Mourning soon ceased not one stands alive

It seems like this world ain't getting any better
The more we try to get closer to You
The farther we run from Your throne

I've spent so many nights wonderin' when will it end
When will the day come when happiness begins
I'm running the race but it seems too hard to win
I'm sick of mourning my stomach is throwing up in the morning

I'm calling for help and watching it melt away
My heart's been put on display and put away
In many ways, many times I told myself it was ok
And anger was the price that was paid
While these faded dreams just screamed to bring them home

The burden was too heavy I kept running from the throne
I can't take it any longer
I can taste my spirit hunger
God please help me get home

And I'm writing this song, for the people who don't belong
I pray away the pain you feel from all the things that went wrong
Inside a life that's filled with anger and disappointment
'Cause daddy treated you weaker than all of the other kids
It's annoying and I feel for all of you who wanna give up
You feel stuck I feel the same way Lord help us stay up
You couldn't pay me to abandon the idea of true hope
That I could make it through this life into a place where there's no crying
I'm dying to find You with open arms when I go
Knowing You love me and You waiting to give rest to my soul

          And when we get through, you don't even want to cuddle 
          You need to check in when you're hanging with your friends 
          Trying to be like daddy is (?) 
          Being a man is hard like (?) 
          I'ma take you to the 60's and burn my boxes 
          Yeah, and burn my boxes 
          You know what I'm saying? (?)

          Would there be rocketships, way more fights? 
          Dress up everyday, more satellites?

Vitamin C,"And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn twenty five
I keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same
But when we leave this year, we won't be coming back
No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day
Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
And I keep thinking of that night in June
I didn't know much of love
But it came too soon
And there was me and you
And then we got real cool
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

So if we get the big jobs
And we make the big money
When we look back now
Will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school
Still be trying to break every single rule?
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
And this is how it feels

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

La, la, la, la
Yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la
We will still be friends forever

Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there?
Can we make it somehow (somehow)?
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be

Vitamin C,"Some things I guess I won't forget
Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
There's no rewinding life tonight, tonight
Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the lucky winner because I played the part
Don't want to say goodbye tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
I want to keep these thoughts away, from me
From me
It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about
The kisses that were promises
That were suppose to be planned
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
Funny how you said we would never change
Let me tell you something baby, life is strange
But that was then and this is now

And in the hustle and bustle no sunshine appears
But you and I have a love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Volare, oh oh

Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds

We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like bird of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

Vitamin String Quartet,"I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

So toss me out and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes

Don't think that I can take another empty moment
Don't think that I can fake another hollow smile
It's not enough just to be sorry
Don't think that I could take another talk about it

Just like me you got needs

And we softly surrender
To these lives that we've tendered away

Don't wanna be somewhere where I just don't belong
Where it's not enough just be sorry

Tried to be more than me
And I gave till it all went away
And we've only surrendered
To the worst part of these winters we've made

He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought

We kept this hat of broken dreams
And we pulled them out, when we needed them around

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
I just caved in
And I don't feel nothing

There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate
It lets us know if he comes around
I don't sleep that good anyway
If you've never heard the silence, it's a God awful sound

And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
And I don't feel nothing

I don't feel nothing, no I don't feel nothing
There's nothing to feel good about here

I could drive, but it takes so much to get there
Don't get off on all the broken glass,
The Cadillac scene, well

In an over emotional way

Vitamin String Quartet,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

Won't you let me go down in my dreams

And he saw his days burn up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinking up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smoking up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

There's a good life
Right across the green fields
And each generation
Stares at it from afar
But we keep no check
On our appetites
So the green fields turn to brown
Like paper in fire

Living through your fickle phases
I love you

And it's getting easier each day
To weep about you
Harder every night to sleep without you
How many years must I be driven
By this dream
Of love with you?

Trying just to talk but
You don't answer . . . you let it ring

Give to you, love

infected and disastrous
It breathes chaotic catastrophe
it cries to be renewed
Its tears are the color of anger,
they dry to form a scab
To the touch, its stiff and resilient,
underneath, the new skin breathes
As outwardly cliche as it may seem,
yes, something under the surface says,
""C'est la vie""
It is a circle, there is a plan
dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Look closely at the open wound
see past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe,
creation takes stage.
Its all been saved
with exception for the right parts
When will we be new skin?
Its all been seen with exception for what could be

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Son"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'll say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""
(Hey, back home)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", I said, ""you can keep my things, they've come to take me home""",Solsbury Hill,2004

You said it wasn't good enough.
But still we're trying one more time.

Maybe we're just trying to hard.

My poetry is set like a U.F.O.
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without vanilla my soliloquoy profess my ability to just

The pill brimmage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist, and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it I'm the Lieutenant
that surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mountain into grands of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The desperado, that refuse to follow
The Fifth afficianado, break you up into parts like vibrato

Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back and forth the same

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but

Gust blew them backwards and the sting in my eyes

Poor single mother that would raise us alone,
We'd never see the money that
Went down your throat
Through the hole in your belly.

Standing in line for Thanksgiving dinner at the catholic church. the servers
Wore crosses
To shield from the sufferance plauging the others.

Tables charity reeks of cheap wine and pity
And I'm thinking of you. I do every year
When we count all our blessings
And wonder what we're doing here.

You're a disgrace to the concept of family
The priest won't divulge that fact in his homily and I'll stand up and scream
If the mourning remain quiet,
You can deck out a lie in a suit but I won't buy it.

Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines in a place where we only say good-bye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds
But I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground as the T.V. entertained itself

Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room

Scabs again.
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue.
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in.
I wanna feel the changes coming down.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow.
Change is coming through my shadow.
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again.
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
And insecure delusions.

Feel the outside turning in.
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured within
My shadow
Change is coming.
Now is my time.
Listen to my muscle memory.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Forty-six and two ahead of me.
I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give and to
Move, learn and love and to
Cry, kill and die and to
Be paranoid and to
Lie, hate and fear and to
Do what it takes to move through.
I choose to live and to
Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and love and to
Do what it takes to step through.

By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side.
Step into the shadow.

What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake

They're both totally void of hate,
But killing me just the same.

What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me.
Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down.
And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times.
I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.
And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die.
It's all right.

Slip away, to fade away.

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)

Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you want to make the world a better place)

(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!

It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!

You know
You've got to stop it,

Vitamin Z,"Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you,
Arm in arm with just another guy,
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly,
I look at you and the cars go passing by.

I understand that you used to love me,
Nothing much but it made you cry,
So here we are making pleasant gestures,
and I just can't see the reason why.

Me and you we never made it far girl,
Now I laugh at the promises we made,
and something went the first time that I hurt you,
the lights went out and the memories start to fade.

And all along on my trip to nowhere,
You annoyed me with your foolish games,
And how you teased when I first made love,
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame,
Burning flame, burning flame.

And all along on my trip to nowhere,
You annoyed me with your foolish games,

All my dreams down they fell,
And would an angel show mercy to the devil,
But you're under my skin and you know darn well.

Vitaro,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows...",It Must Have Been Love,1994
Vitaro,"I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

You said there would be warm love in springtime
That was when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

You said then you'd be alive in autumn
Then you said you'd be the one to see the way
No, no no no no I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

Vitas,"Очень много раз Я Себе задавал вопрос,
Для чего родился на Свет, Я взрослел и рос?
Для чего плывут Облака и идут Дожди?
В этом Мире Ты для Себя Ничего не жди...
Я бы улетел к Облакам - да Крыльев нет...
Манит Меня издалека тот Звездный Свет!
Но звезду достать нелегко, хоть цель близка...
И не знаю, хватит ли сил для броска!

Я подожду еще чуть-чуть,
И собираться буду в Путь,
Вслед за надеждой и мечтой!
Не догорай Звезда Моя, постой...

Сколько же еще Мне Дорог предстоит пройти?
Сколько покорить Мне Вершин, чтоб Себя найти?
Сколько же с отвесной Скалы Мне падать вниз?
Сколько начинать Все с Нуля, и есть ли Смысл?

И собираться буду в Путь

Ela é linda de verdade
É realmente dela
Nunca perde a validade
Ser aquela luz que vai brilhar a eternidade
E seu sorriso lindo iluminando sua vida inteira

Tua pele traz o cheiro de jasmim
É teu perfume, flor, cravo, canela e alecrim

Só pra cuidar do seu jardim
Regando sua vida todo dia até o fim

Still playin' Wooden Leather, that's alright
Nah nuh-uh we not broke up

You held me down from day one
It's the same old slang
8th grade rockin' shell toes(?) and fake gold chains
Freestylin' on the playground, the game don't change
Just the playas, who made it through the same long days

Nappys on the track and we lovin' this feedback
Still your verse was cold like Kobe on game night
I appreciate that love, thanks for spelling my name right
Sometimes I'm unsure and insecure, then the sight of your face
Helps me endure
That's why we go hard when we out on tour
Be sure to buy the cd when it's out in stores
Cause what I'm sayin' is
Uh uh

Dear fans out in cope cod
Big sky Montana, to Atlanta out on boulevard
The hurricane just missed us
We in Baton Rouge now with kids takin' pictures
Last night we did Cheyenne

Falamos, Falamos coisas tão loucas
Que acabamos em silêncio

E nas mãos o mês frio de Janeiro

E eu, que queria ser forte, respondi que tinha frio
Falei-te do vento norte
Não, não me digas adeus
Quem sabe, talvez um dia
Como eu tremia, meu Deus
Amei como nunca amei
Fui louco, não sei, talvez mas por pouco

You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
And please do not lead her on when you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
She's a woman now
With a daughter to make her proud
In her crayon world of paper clouds
She still remembers you
The first boy that she gave it to
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Her daughter's five and her grandfather adores her (of course)
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

And she makes her other home girls proud

She's as simple as a girl can be
Yet she has a cool complexity
But she kissed me

Now I'm an older woman's toy
Because she kissed me
And she put it there

The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.

O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!

Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.

Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!

I gave him one, he lit it in his own good time

When he talked it sounded like a growling dog
He said, ""Would you care for a dollar on the five or nine?""

Now this man was ugly and his eyes were mean
His clothes were dirty but his hands were clean
He held that stick like a mother holds the hand of her child
Well, I've been known to hustle a few
When the waitress said, ""Was he playing you?""
And I said, ""Yeah, bring me brandy water by""

Little Red Parker was way in the back taking quarters and handling racks
And I told him, ""Red, come up here, glue 'em up tight

And I checked her form
And I said, ""Honey, you like a winner"", and she just smiled

I played like a man with a broken wrist, I won two and he won six
And I had him set up so I said, ""Let's play for five""
But this time the crowd had gathered round
To see this fish and just watch him drown
I told that waitress, ""More brandy water by""

Then he went out and got a custom cue
He said, ""It's no offense to you
But I don't play off the wall with nobody but friends""
He had a gold initials in a leather grip pearly and silver inlaid tip
He smiled at me and he said, ""Hell-a-way, we play for ten""

Well, I never seen a man that walk who made those balls and table talk
They're speaking English, he sure didn't need my help
He broke the ball and kept that string
For a hundred and eighty seven bucks and a ring
Till I gave up and said, ""Friend, you're gonna have to play by yourself""

Well, he racked it up and walked outside
And I strolled out just to watch him ride
And there was a blond in their caddy built like the rest of that car
The boys in the poolroom they had 'em a laugh
And I hung it up and just let it pass
And had nothin' but my elbows to put on the bar

And the waitress smiled said, ""Water by?""
I took the charity and thanked her polite

There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel

Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there

And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

Maybe it's more than the moon,
Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you! 

[Chorus]

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love! 

Margie and Pat:
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I've had two or three,
I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head

(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone
I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I've had three or four,
I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs
of the world around me I’m in the mood,
to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if
I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro,
my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls
I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world
let the truth surround me

out my window it was raining 
didn't even feel like running, I didn't feel like doing anything 
Then the phone wouldn't stop ringing and my head wouldn't stop pounding. 
I feel so down I don't know why, there's something 
overwhelming me inside

Just one of those days 
Just another day, it don't go your way 
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough for me) 
Just one of those days- oooh 
Just another day, it don't dg your way 
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough) 

Gotta get up, any how I can't afford to lose no hours 
Got a deadline that I must meet, Every second matters to me 
Hard to function feeling like this 
But I got to keep on going, am I in a huddle to get over 
I've got to do things much darker and colder

Why does it seem

Why do they fly

They're not around
To ever remind me

Maybe I don't need to know what's really love

Maybe this is
As good as it gets

Watching and waiting in line for your turn
I've learned to walk with my back to the fire
I like the heat but I don't want to get burned

And if you need water
I'll be a river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be a river
And my love will carry you through

Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence
Ready to crumble at the slightest word
Finding the right one is becoming a science
I'd like to scream but I ain't gonna be heard

Vivian Green,"I admit that not a lot of time had passed by
But we decided that we would be together
Everybody, they talked and had opinions, they did

And they had doubts about what we would become
But I knew you were and you knew I was the one
Over other people, no, we'd never make a fuss
'Cause it will never be about them, just us

Nobody but us, only me and him
We're the only ones that matter
They know what we've got, only me and him
So we never mind the chatter

What it is that made us feel so good about it?
What it is that made me go half crazy for?
What it is that made him give it all to me?
It's all about us, as long as we know

What it is that made us feel so good about it?
What it is that made me go half crazy for?
What it is that made him give it all to me?
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is

There were moments not always so perfect
But we know that's just the beauty of it
Go through things and then we learn from them, oh

Honestly we can work each other's last nerve
Then make up with the sweetest of making love
And no one has to understand that, just us

Now what I'm going through, might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I'll like it
What I'm going through, might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I'll like it, I do

Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now

I heard you were married
Had a few babies
Put on on a few pounds, that grown man weight
But heard you looked real good
Makin six figures
Well I could of figured you were always ambitious
You went to college, I did my singing thing
Moving around it's hard to stay in touch
But I've missed you so much over the years
Just wanted to give you a hollar say hey 
How you doin these days

It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now

You were so funny, had me in stiches
Now any man I date must make me laugh
You kissed me in places thought I was going to hell
Secrets I would never tell my momma then
But you were so sweet
Didn't take my virginity
But you saw the good in me
Even talked about marrying me
The future we tried to see
We were not suppose to pass
Now everything doesn't last
I wanted to say hey how you doin these days
I guess I don't know you no more
I wonder how much you've change
Would we have the same chemistry?
Could you still make me laugh?
Could we still have a blast?
Are you happy? Have you've done all thing to wanted to?
One thing I want to do is to see you and just chill, just talk and reminisce
It would make me so happy if we could do this

It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory

Vivian Green,"I'm happy, so ready
For the next phase in my life
These days are fulfilling
And I have peace of mind

But every time I get too high
You do your best to knock me down
But I am not who I was back then
You're trying to hurt me, you're really trying

I feel like you owe me
No fighting, fussing, caring to start an argument
Why can't I have my peace?
I understand why they say misery love company

But what you failed to see I hold
The power I am in control
And all things must come to an end
You're trying to hurt me, you're really trying

You're trying but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
You're trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win

You're trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'll ever be unhappy again
You're trying so hard to get under my skin
You're trying, but it's all right

You watch it, you wait for
Your 15 minutes of my day
It make you feel good
If you think that you've got into me

Funny 'cause I don't wish nothing bad on you
Constant drama all you wanna put me through
I've made my decision and I'm firm on it
So I don't know why you're even trying

You're trying but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
You're trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win

You're trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'll ever be unhappy again
You're trying so hard to get under my skin
You're trying, but it's all right

I'm feelin' faith
And no you can't take that from me
You're driving all your energies
Into yourself and turn it to positivity

I'm feelin' faith
And no you can't take that from me

Into yourself and turn it to positivity

Vivian Green,"Remember wanting me so much
I used to tingle from your touch
And I'd wait for you to come home
You're sittin' right beside the phone

And there was nothing else but you
And who could separate us to
I'd never know when we got lost
But now I'm counting up the calls

I wish we could go back
To love less complicated
I wish we could go back
Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no

Please tell me you miss that
That new love, crazy love
'Cause I wanna go back
I know it's possible, tell me you feel it too

What I wouldn't do to rekindle our romance
Oh, what I wouldn't do, not many get a second chance, oh no
Come on baby, 'cause our love hasn't yet died
Ooh, it hasn't died, we gotta give love one more try

We barely talked we barely smiled
No hint of what we used to be
No courtesy and no romance
Not to much left of you and me

But it's not to late I believe
But baby we can get it back
'Cause life's to short for us to let
What we had die and just forget

I wish we could go back
To love less complicated
I wish we could go back
Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no

Please tell me you miss that
That new love, crazy love
'Cause I wanna go back
I know it's possible, tell me you feel it too

Let's go back

(Oh, what I wouldn't do)
Let's go back

(Don't you wanna go back, baby)

Let's go back
(I know it's possible)
(Oh, what I wouldn't do)
Let's go back
(Go back)

I wish we could go back
To love less complicated
I wish we could go back

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

Da da, da da, da da da

I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me no more
But I'm gonna change your mind
Some way, somehow

Da da, da da, da da da

To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you wanna care?
Ain't it lonely out there?

Vivian Green,"I don't want to waste an entire album on you
I've been there done that yeah
I don't want to put all the anger you caused me back on you
Though I know I'd be justified but I'm in another place
I don't want to put any negative thoughts into this universe 
I've done it enough oh
And I don't want to tell who what when where why and how cause who cares
No nobody cares
But I hope you soon find out how to love 
Once upon a time you wanted to learn 
I thought I could teach you but you were more afraid than willing 
So when it comes don't push it away 
One day you will find it is the greatest gift 
And I hope you don't take advantage of it again
Hold her when she wants to be held
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you oh
Take her to her favorite place more often than not don't take her kindness for weakness cause I'm sure she'll love you a lot
Support her in all that she does
Don't tear her down lift her up
Cause that is the worse thing you can do to someone you love
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful 
I used to think that I could not bare you to be with anyone but me
But I've been there done that yeah 
And since then I've come to think silly of that whole mentality 
Cause I want to find love too though it won't be with you
I wish for everyone to one day find happiness and love 
Including you yeah
And I don't want to go into details cause I've said enough 
And it's not my intent to hurt you no 
But I hope you soon find out how to love 
Once upon a time you wanted to learn 
I thought I could teach you but you were more afraid than willing 
So when it comes don't push it away
One day you will find it is the greatest gift

Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you oh

Don't tear her down lift her up
