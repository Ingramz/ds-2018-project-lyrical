Little Big Town,"Hangin' out with the scarecrow blues
On the other side of being used
The whine and the whistle of a passing train
Sounds so heavy when it says your name

Baby, when you're down, baby, when you're way down
Lost your shine and your feet are cold
You don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down
You're like silver, you're like gold
You're like silver, you're like gold

Wind caught up in the weather vane
Soaked to the bone from a summer rain
I'll be right here to see you through
The dust, and the rust, and the scarecrow blues

Baby, when you're down, baby, when you're way down
Lost your shine and your feet are cold
You don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down
You're like silver, you're like gold
You're like silver, you're like gold

Baby, when you're down, baby, when you're way down
Lost your shine and your feet are cold
You don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down
You're like silver, you're like gold
You're like silver, you're like gold",Silver and Gold,2014
Little Big Town,"Wish we could stay all night
Well, we're gonna have to pay for the hotel, oh well
Least the drinks are free
Oh, I don't know if it's right
But tonight I'm tyin' one on you better believe it

Weekend is in, show time is now
Tell all your friends and bring your mom and them
We'll even put you on a list for a small price, so nice
To see your face again
Yeah, it feels good to finally be feelin' right
I wish we could stay all night

We're burnin' rubber late for the load-in
Rollin' through the radio, passin' the time
Just enough gas to get there, say a prayer
Lord, let this old Ford Fly
It ain't the fame, the money, the game
Gettin' your name on the big marquee
It's all about the song makes your heart thump, feet stomp
The way it's supposed to be
Feels good to finally be feelin' right
Wish we could stay all night

Oh, wish this drink would never end
Hell, I just caught my second wind
Why don't the good stuff ever last
It comes and goes and it goes so fast
They're shuttin' it down and turn on the lights, yeah
Wish we could stay all night

Wish we could stay all night
Can't go home but you can't stay here
Wish we could stay all night
Go on and pop the top on one more beer

Wish we could stay all night
We're gonna have to pay for a hotel, oh well
Wish we could stay all night
Tell all your friends and bring your mom and them
I wish we could stay all night",Stay All Night,2014
Little Big Town,"A dynasty, I built your fantasy
Let you reign over me
Like a king in a palace
Obsession, I was your medicine
And you came after me
Like you couldn’t live without it

Like faith in the faithful
I was the loyal in your loyalty
I put my cards on your table
And I treated you like royalty

These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
But you’re gonna think about them when I’m gone

Savior, I’ve always saved your deft reputation
Stuck around when you were down
Together, I held you together
I kept you from caving
But now you’re crumbling to the ground
I was the arm in your armor
I was the miss in your mistake
And you only make it harder
On yourself when you walk away

These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
But you’re gonna think about them when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone

Like faith in the faithful
I was the loyal in your loyalty
I put my cards on your table
And I treated you like royalty

These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
But you’re gonna think about them when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
These are the things that you don’t think about
When you think about me
But you’re gonna think about them when I’m gone

You’re gonna think about ‘em
You’re gonna think about 'em, think about 'em, when I’m gone",Things You Don't Think About,2014
Little Big Town,"It's a want you, it's a need you, it's a hold on through the pain
It's a get through what you got to, 'cause it can't stay the same
It's a long talk with the lights off, it's the last breath in your lungs
It's the deep end that we jump in, it's the love that we become

We're gonna ride the storm out on a lifeboat
Baby this kind of love is all that we know
We're gonna take a walk out on the trapeze
Even in a wild breeze, we could be the best of them all
Even if we tumble and fall

It's a reach out, it's a white flag, it's a forfeit of the game
It's a let go of the ego, and the whisper of your name
It's a fight for, not a defend, it's a stay out in the rain
It's the knowin' that you love me more than anything

We're gonna ride the storm out on a lifeboat
Baby this kind of love is all that we know
We're gonna take a walk out on the trapeze
Even in a wild breeze, we could be the best of them all
Even if we tumble and fall

It's a want you, it's a need you, it's a hold on through the pain
It's a get through what you got to, yeah you got to, yeah we got to

We're gonna ride the storm out on a lifeboat
Baby this kind of love is all that we know
We're gonna take a walk out on the trapeze
Even in a wild breeze, we could be the best of them all
Even if we tumble and fall
Even if we tumble and fall",Tumble and Fall,2014
Little Big Town,"Sucker punched, down for the count
They stole your thunder then your crown
Paralyzed, just hangin' around, you better get up
Or get down

Put your money where you're talkin'
Let your assets do the walkin'
So what, the sky is fallin' get up
Or get down
In the shadows, outta time
You ain't bound and you ain't blind

Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Lift your hands up

Swingin' from a chandelier
Ain't no trouble way up here
Shootin' through the atmosphere
Get up or get down

Ain't no time to hit the brakes
Flip the switch and let it shake
Wind it up while you're awake
Get up or get down
Get down, get down

Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up

Lift up your hands, open your eyes
If we're going, we're goin' live

Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, baby
Turn the lights on, lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up

Turn the lights in, turn the lights on",Turn the Lights On,2014
Little Big Town,"It was one of those times what a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hanging with friends, going again start upbringing, smokin’ and drinkin’
It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn’t know quite what to do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time that I go out, smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here’s to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin’ and drinkin’

We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were going to miss
But damn we know it now 'cause that’s all we talk about, smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here’s to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here’s to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here’s to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin’ and drinkin’

All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child

Little Big Town,"Here you come again
With that wreckin' smile
The one that does me in every time
I wanna drink you in
And make you stay awhile
Wonder if your heart is racing just like mine?

I know you know just what you do to me
I feel your eyes, they cut right through me

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
You found your way into every hiding place
And baby, you burn me to the ground
You take me down

Every word you whisper
Turns me inside-out
Your hands are makin' memories on my skin
Kiss after kiss
You melt away the doubt
You got me where you want me
I'm giving in

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
You found your way into every hiding place
And baby, you burn me to the ground
You take me down

And now you know just what you do to me
I'm undone by every way you move me

Oh, I love the way you move me
You take me down

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
And you found your way into every hiding place

Little Big Town,"I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t four am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it I know 
The bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye

And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man

Keep myself to myself
I walk the streets in the rain
And keep my head down

'Cause I've been brokenhearted
And maybe I'm guilty of the same
But suddenly something started
I'm like a moth into the flame

Baby when our hearts collide
We're leaving a whole world behind
The planets and the stars align
Holding back the hands of time

Feet kept firm on the ground
But my head got lost in the clouds
Hands in pockets and dreams
In hidden places

So I've been brokenhearted
And may be I'm guilty of the same

I'm like a moth into the flame

Little Boots,"Mathematics is a difficult thing
I never understood what was the missing link
And by the time I calculated the correct solution
The question had escaped me and so did the conclusion

So tell me everything must always equal two
Or nothing else is true
And I'll believe you 'cause your X is equal to my why
But equations pass me by

So will you take just a little of my mind and subtract it from my soul
Add a fraction of your half and you'll see it makes me whole
Multiply it by the times that we've never been apart
You'll see nothing can divide just a heart plus a heart

A little of my mind, take it from my soul
A fraction of your half, see it makes me whole
And multiply the times, never be apart
'Cause nothing can divide a heart plus a heart

Don't know my Fibonacci or Pythagoras
But the only formula I know will work for us is that
When we're together in the sum of our parts
It's far greater than what we added up to at the start

So tell me everything must always equal two
Or nothing else is true
And I'll believe you 'cause your X is equal to my why

About what sweety?

[Mr. Hyde]
Walking war minded with the echoes doused in blood
From stretching out your lungs mega penetrate my guns
So I keep 'em concealed I'll leave you leakin for real
The mother fuckin devil kid grim reaper with steel
Yo the sickos on reserve load the clip up with my word
I spit til you're disturbed verbs ticklin your nerves
Cock back the hammer in the center with gore shot
Foully droppin newborns on top of their soft spots
Quick vagina soars rippin out your spinal chords
You got gashes on your boards but you're dead like dinosaurs
Hand cuff you to the bed the drama's seeming sickening
Leave you faggots dead just like Jeffery Dahmer's victims
Pissin in your mouth you got an obscene smile
Your teeth are shinin yellow like that retard from Green Mile
Slice your wrists with the box cutter like this
Another sly bitch with the butterfly stitch
Born to hate your par so you catch a gapin scar
A wide open wound you can't close with staplers
Or a needle and thread this beat is leaving you dead
I blow a shot through the top now I can see through your head

My squad will bust through in herds bitch let me remind you
You're coughin your tonsils with my elephant shrapnel
Destined to stomp you stuff your face in the mud
Never waist no slugs that's why I pace with the jud
Guns will point at blank range I'm pointin pistols for brains
Put you splattered like paint your whole anatomy faints
Stuffed like Latter Day Saints that don't know how to be quaint
It's assault robbery or a battery rape
Peep the tragedy shake and the pin dropping silence
You shot with the 9 inch for stoppin the violence
Do you a slight favor before you're mortified
Cut you with the light saber and wound your quarter eyes
Ain't nowhere to hide from my gruesome legacy
It's hard to flea while you bleed cause you're losing energy
Foul like sexual harassin blast you with the mack 10
Violent homicide the intellectual assassin
Drill saws and tools fill the gore slaughter you
Drown you in a water pool now your breath bubbles rise
Trash troubles lies but see I'm the one who ends em
Deatha and disguise with the leatherface resemblance

I ain't stack no paper I don't 
Walk around wearin' gators, shit I'm still walkin'
I'm still the same Pooh, I still
Do the things I used to, I still hang with the same crew
The way I act now I blame to
The other chick I speak about got addicted to the fame to
I rocked a couple joints the album sell
I got a couple points, small change to the pockets
I don't understand these broads logic, I break 
Bread with the fam before I hit em with a piece a profit
I'm allergic to you hoes stop it
Got me wonderin' was the attention before 
Or after the shock of seein Big Pooh's pic in the store
Got yo eyes money green and me slammin the door

Is it the way I rhyme that got you stressed, sittin' in the
Back sweatin' and lookin' a mess
Nervous even pervis you shots with the bullets you pussycat
I had no choice but to pull it
But who wouldn't, swingin' aimlessly 
You got the same nerve to say you in the same vain as me
How ashamed are we you not the man that we claimed 
To be now are fame is in jeopardy
You shouldn't have slept on me, the mic I had to snatch
Back and react like white boys in the mosh pit
The fly shit is easy to get stuck on 
I penned joints for you to vibe to and get you're fuck on
You couldn't last one round 
I suggest you back up off my nuts and put the dick down

Little Brother,"Yo, I bought a brand new album today
Decide to take it home kick off my shoes relax and play
And spin it for the whole joint cause I like to get the whole point
Music is everything to me and I refuse to rock the piece
Cause you're my favorite emcee
All I want is what you would ask of me, hi Kwelity
And some Definition
Wonder why we bootleg like it's prohibition
It's difficult it's dismissing
I got suspicions that your ears to the streets where we're whispering
Are you listening?
I took your L-P to D-C, where some youngin's
Gave me the L-D on how it should be
Make sure the beat knock 'til the trunk pop
And everybody pause when you cruise down the block
Roll down your window and they ask what you playin'
But don't nobody care what you're sayin'
That's what they told me y'all

This is a message for our people chasing Benjamin's
With real rhymes and skills they believing in
Keeping them bad tapes rolling like Michellin
It don't matter, cause niggas ain't listening
They ain't listening, they thinkin' bout they timbalands
They say the shit we talk about ain't interestin'
We got a better chance of blowing up in Switzerland
Holla if you hear it cause niggas ain't listening

Music was my sanctuary so I take a long listen
To hip hop living out my life in songs wishin'
My parents I could get along with them
So I would go inside my room and dig deep inside the strong rhythms
Back when fresh was the word, and raw was on prism
Marley on the boards, plus Kane was long livin'
G rap and A spittin' murderous
Bought long live the kane sat down and learned every word of it
Sneakin' my walk man in the homeroom playin' it
Listen for punchlines delivery and cadences
But nowadays it's like niggas wanna play with it
They hear some good shit but don't stop to savor it
Like one night we was out in my whip
With some broads just chillin' playin' demos and shit
Asked 'em how I sounded rockin' the mike
One chicl told me all she listened to was beats, thank god for ninth
Trying to get pressed on vinyl cause motherfuckers buy your CD
But turn around don't even know your song titles
Like track 2 is hot, and track 6 is long
Ain't even listening, I'm hoping I get through to y'all

This is a message for our people chasing Benjamin's

We got a better chance of blowing up in Switzerland
Holla if you hear it cause niggas ain't listening

Fly Motorola diploma style ice niggas
Asparagus rosemary chips for all my nice niggas
We roll through niggas masked in vengeance
U-Haul emcees chasing Brown Sugars
And you thought that it would never happen
Thought that it would never happen
My clever rappin' keeps my celery growing
Judy Jetson up in Elroy's thought he was home
With the Gold Bond Armor-All fatigues on
Rosey in the pantry with Velma and Shaggy getting they lean on
He sweeter that a Whitney Hous' track hittin' them high notes
And Alex Keaton always frontin' like he high post
Screaming on Justine when he flippin' the script
Tony Danza left a playa celibate
Rippin' rhymes for the hell of it
Check all these bitches on my Soul Glow city
Walkin round with Madagascar titties
Imported for my Cole Train leaves ya elephant niggas
Yo peace Jovan the sky be purple and orange

Writin' on the plane, these words is barely legible
But once again back is the incredible

The Little Brother, we number one
Always getting' the job done
We some smooth operators
Haters come close but they can't touch
Run back and they can't rush, imagine dat shit

Jay Dee's dreams is plastic
I'm tired of stretchin' money out like elastic
Drastic measures we gon' have to take
Like servin' classes up fresh out da gate

Without the papes

We 'bout to get this rap shit nailed down
'Cause stakes

Is high, so I eat at Taco Bell now

Yo, get it up 'cause it's alright for y'all to yell now
Wearin' yo' Avirex, the cowry shell down

It's so beautiful, so fabulous
So exclusive, so extravagant

Neva fakin', keep on

If you think you can out rhyme me, boy, I bet
I ain't met the motherfucka who can do that yet
Why their played out rhymes remain odd
I stay cool like James Todd and still remain dominant

Up in yo' spot, tonight we steady rockin' it
And I'm gonna knock you out just like mama said
To Lenny, blunt smokes, cigarettes, Henny
But it's somethin' 'bout these hoes, Lord, forgive me

I stepped in about a quarter pass, you know, whatever
I'm tryin' to get up on some ass like whatever
And grab a quick bite by the end of the night
I drain tryin' to complain and knees killin' me, right

But you know we got dat hot shit
Known to rock da block and cause turbulence
When you in da cock pit cool 'cause he don't get upset
I grab a bucket of wings, get some snacks and I jet

And to you rappers takin' all figures

For industry niggas, da ball players
Droppin' 'em off of all makers
Wit yo' whole team in ambulances
We buildin' more beef than cattle ranches
Against the snowstorms and avalanches

Well, it was one of those days
(Not much to do)
I was steady writin' rhymes
(For the Little Brother crew)

Of the two be Phonte and 9th, plus Eccentric
And Big Doe in case I didn't mention
(But did you tell 'em 'bout the League)
Oh yes, the League of Justice
(And did you remember what they need?)
These kids, they want substance

Rhymes and beats keep my day flowin' lovely
But I'ma save crumbs and pass it off to Doug E
This is all about, no doubt for Little Brother
But first let's take a moment to recover

This has been writtin', it's never bitin'
You keep forgettin' the lyrics on tracks that I'm spittin'
The only thing worse are the emcees that I'm rippin'
They talkin' shit and wishin'

Some of these guys getting' all hurked up
From a ghost-writtin' rhyme by a chump, word up

Little Brother,"This life have a nigga hustling man
Niggas need to slow it down yo
Sit back just chill just relax
Speeding down the roads of life
Yo check it

Another day to face, I'm share cropping in the paper chase
Take a deep breath and clear my database
It's afternoon I'm talking shit to my alarm clock
Cause I gotta face this world of capitalistic onslaught
Don't stop when I jump in the whip, tryin to get it off
Beltline got me rushin like Barichnakof
Pushin 80 miles per hour to this, call center
Tryin to pick up a check I only see twenty percent a
Until the weekend, it sound crazy when I'm sayin it
But sleep is nice, got me forgettin what day it is
Until my son two days with out speakin, looking for
Reasons to keep my heir from goin off the deep end
I take this shit personally, I'm makin moves
But this treadmill lifestyle ain't workin for me
It's from ya crib to ya lab to ya job to make a profit
And at the days end you still got nothing accomplished
And it's just the way it's goin down, but on the real
I think I need to slow it down and slow it down

This joint is goin too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you

I try to slow it down like Brand Nubian
But hypnotic tunes like this always do me in
Got a nigga about to go and burn the road again
From first gear to fifth gear out of control again

And that's the way we rolling in, needed to chill
And take a rest stop cause my job got me slaving like
I'm Dred Scott, take a break nah nigga you betta not
Cause that's when the respect stops energy drain
I need a blast like Hi-Tek got so I can grab
The mic and make you're heads bop with the microphone check
One two it don't stop, out of town on a quick
Escape hoping to have a chance to slow it up and hit the breaks
And slow it down

This joint is goin too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you

I let me life shine in between these papers lines
I write rhymes to incite minds
Spending time on this pipeline, eighty-five
North it's like mine, going eighty five to light minds
Going ninety five to take time
Spending days in the rays of the sunshine
Many days those same rays went undefined
Now forty east is where I go to have my best times
Three lanes going sixty to perfect rhymes
Tre dose and master craft catch punch lines
We turning early morning late night times
Amtrack Monday morning to come back rides
Catch a couch on the weekend, a place I rarely did sleep in
Tay (Phonte) car speaker knobs is tweakin
Cause the way we be rockin it when joints is finished
At the speed we be moving we could never be diminished

With my energy replenished write a rhyme with puns and
All my similes intended speed out until I finish
Keep it on now
We keep it, and keep it, and keep it on now
And keep it, and keep it, we keep it on now
We run it, we do it, we keep it on now
We do it, we did it, we keep it on now
We don't stop

This joint is goin too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you
This joint is goin too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you",Speed,2003

Little Brother,"What up brown skin, you're body smellin like cinnamon
Hair in a bun, your toes done so feminine
Heard you suck your teeth like oh no here we go again
Let me get your name so I can be more genuine
No need to front, the kid knows you got many friends
Many men's who waiting to stake a claim on it
Put they name down just to spit some game on it
But fuck friends I'm trying to set the mood
You know, go at you hard like most records that's sold
Spit propaganda at you to you break down and fold
You look confused miss thing like I'm speaking in code
76-64 press pound hello
Are you listening now, did I get your attention
Undivided because you used to be undecided
Now you looking fluxed like those chicks with they nose stuck up
Just put your number down girl what the fuck

Hey yo that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Yo that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Don't worry bout it girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
OK alright, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say

I usually play the background, you know clean cut
Soft spoken well dressed dipped out straight chillin'
When I'm in the club yo, sipping the sprite with the
Ill lemon mixed in it sipping on it I was just chillin'
Til I saw you that's when my heart stopped knees gave
Head sweating jaws locked I was sweating you
Like god damn girl you got a nigga going buck wild,
Mesmerized star struck I was thinking maybe
We can go out like to the movies or the Applebee's
Blockbuster state fair but you looked at me and
Said fuck that you just a herb with no money and
No jeep and no condo and I thought that Little Brother
Had a record deal, OK I see where you going now
Want a sweat a nigga when you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time but fuck that
I got your head still bobbing and my verse didn't rhyme
So it's what ever girl

Hey yo that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Yo that's alright girl, what ever you say

Like to rub on my tummy while I tell you something funny
Whispering in your ear till them panties go falling
What's my name (Big Pooh) yea that's what they be calling

Oh yea I know I'm husky but chicks still love me
3 o'clock still have they ass running to Waffle House fa me
Be feeling on that ass till me name they be calling
And shit got them so wet they make a Freudian slip and
Fall down into my verbal abyss that's straight Reservoir
Dog style perfecto served with a kiss
Muah baby, it's just like this no need to fight it
Invite it try me out you just might like it

Had a good thing here let's rewind facts
Believe me I know all about them other cats
How they all played the game just to get to you
Spitting all in my ear which you liked who
Tickled your fancy who you would invite to
Be yours, I penned verses
Quote verses, with purpose, so nervous
I wrote urgence I spoke shy you spoke lie

So what's the reason for the hating, niggas with dreads
Calling they self gods with white girls named Caitlin
And I'm cool with interracial dating, but I ain't about
To hear no fucking speeches cause I wanna have some bacon
I've rocked Antwerp, that's why I can't fuck with
Coffee houses man, get on my god damn nerves
And deep down y'all know that I'm right, man shit I'm bout
To kick some Trick Daddy next poetry night like

Between examining rhymes, without severing my family ties

Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a ""W""

Cocky son of a you know, the word be traveling

And checked out your posterior, oh lord it's

Body like a goddess, it's out of this world
Not a sex therapist looking for inner peace
I'ma sex terrorist hitting your Middle East
And I know my sins won't get me to the promised land
And for eternal life my chances ain't promising

And take these inner demons out my life, I promise man

Talking 'bout enough money so you can live your dreams

Got the perfect place, got the perfect weight
Gotta slow it down, gotta catch my breath
Gotta keep us on track 'fore we track a mess
Got this lady upstairs in my busy-ness
Gotta keep her upstairs causing me stress
Gotta keep order, maintain the cover
Gotta keep these dudes apart 'fore they kill each other
He gotta keep his job, he had to tell his wife
I'd be surprised if time come man we get it right
The time's here, everybody in they places right?
Time to go to work, let's have a great night

That I'm still just a man, just a lowly sinner
Who's repenting right now God I hope you remember

I'll Mind on production, of course
I got my nigga O-Dash with me tonight
I got Phonte in the house with me tonight

I got my nigga Young Krysis on the boards
D-Brock I see you in the back, baby
But check it out yo

Uh, I got my headphones steady
And you are not ready, 'cause the flows too heavy
Pooh be navigate over tracks like Mario Andretti
I'm sharp as a machete, you tossin' the confetti

Go against me that's doors on a Chevy sixty four
Dishin', niggaz still pitchin'
Sittin' in the kitchen, bangin' on moms table
The rap Clarke Gable, I'm kinda fly with it

I was blessed with the talent to rhyme
And motherfuckers I'm a die with it
Takin' y'all in the high with it
It's my ship from the captain you wanna take a ride in it?

I'm the truth when I step in the booth
AKA a hundred proof raps gasoline
Americas nightmare but a black mans dream
My eyes on the prize no sacrificin'
That's how we do it man, yeah

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
Never, D-Brok tell 'em man

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Pooh, one true authentic
Uh

It's been five long years since we started this
Group that was targeted, that people so annoyed with fast
And them wannabe niggaz and they gorgeous past
You ask me if I changed, fuck man, of course I have

'Cause I got more records to sell
More dollars to clock, I hate it but that's how it's gotta be
Got more stories to tell, more people to watch
And ten times more people watchin' me

So fuck the masquerade, just let me have a say
I still be spittin' regardless of the accolades
Y'all can take back the mics in The Source
Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys

Take back the night we did, ""Speed"", at four in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met ninth in the dorm
Y'all can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writin' wizardry like never before

'Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt wicked times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost my family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me

Lookin' for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to God and He said, Tigga
Low I ain't let you run it back this far
Just so you can go and fumble under one nigga
What he sayin' dog for real?

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me, uh
Yo, you better tell 'em dog

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Tay one true authentic
What? O-Dash, where you at nigga, man, c'mon?

Keep thinkin' shit gravy man
I heavy man, bet you all a dollar, I can change the game
I ain't gotta change the name, just change the aim
For months we gon' have to rearrange ya frame

Stay strapped on the hip, for those wanna trip
'Cause I got fresh feet on the whip
Man gimme a half I'm like Dominique doors on the flip
No respect when I'm clutchin' ya grip

Paranoia sets in, thinkin' 'bout the time you investin'
Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective
Ya ace froze, case closed, nigga body found up in Texas
No witnesses to see who that is

That's how I handle my biz, yup for sho'
Might kidnap your broad in exchange for dough
You know how it go

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
That's how we do it, man, y'all better get it

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one O one true authentic
Yup

Oh yeah
Ain't nobody like me

Yo, six minutes to showtime, I was out in the rain
Wit my nigga Big Pooh goin' over some thangs
No money in our pockets, just a buck and some change
Ran up in the hideaway wit niggas screamin' our name
Took the stage like a jet soarin'
Wildin' out wit the sweat pourin', til I woke up hoarse the next mornin'
An ill feeling that it brings about
To see niggas mouthin' yo words and you ain't even got a single out
On stage stealing yo' spot
It's the equivalent of ten adrenaline shots
Just like L.E.G.A.S.Y. and Sean Boog when they killin' the R.O.C
Ain't gotta worry 'bout if niggas just pretendin' it's hot
'Cause I can see their hands in the air wavin', heads bobbin'

Little Brother,"Uh, Deah Pops
It's your boy
I got some things I want to say to you, man
Just a couple of words
Bear with me
Gimme a minute

Time to face it
Sitting in the middle of the basement
Holding a jack
How I'm anticipating he 'gon call me back

Got so much on my mind
Ain't no holding it back
In fact, I give a fuck how he 'gon react
Through my first nineteen

Asking where he at
Never seen him in the spots where we be at
For the next couple hours I sat 'til the phone rang
No luck or no cigar

So I said to myself I'll try tomorrow
Me and my Vincent left out
Went to shoot play some ball
Came back, had message like 'this your pa'
Then I took to the phone

Conversation was raw
Shit, I had to let him know that his child was scarred
And right now we working through our mess
But I had to get some shit off my chest
So bear with me, y'all

[Chorus]
Just want to take the time to let you know
Sometimes it's hard to let my feelings show
The thoughts of guarantees are really so
This is all for you, you

[Phonte]
I was looking at your photograph amazed how I favored you
I remember being young wanting to play with you
Cause you was a wild and crazy dude
And now I understand why my momma couldn't never stay with you
From the roots to the branches to the leaves
They say apples don't fall far from the trees
I used to find it hard to believe
And I swore that I would
Always hold my family as long as I could
But damn
Our memories can be so misleading
It's misery
I hate to see history repeating
Thought you were the bad guy
But I guess that's why
Me and my girl split
And my son is leaving
I did chores, did bills, and did dirt
But I swear to God I tried to make that shit work
'Til I came off tour to an empty house
With all the dressers and the cabinets emptied out
I think I must've went insane
Thinking I was in love, but really in chains
Trapped to this girl through the two-year old who carried my name
I tried to stop tripping
But yo, I couldn't and the plot thickened
That shit affected me, largely
Because I know a lot of people want me
To fail as a father
And the thought of that haunts me
Especially when I check my rear-view mirror
And don't see him in his car seat
So the next time it's late at night
And I'm laid up with the woman I'mma make my wife
Talking 'bout how we 'gon make a life
I'm thinking about child support, alimony, visitation rights
Cause that's the only outcome if you can't make it right
Pissed off with your children feeling the same pain
So, Pop, how could I blame cause you couldn't maintain
I did the same thing
The same thing

[Chorus: x 2]",All for You,2005
Little Brother,"Open my eyes to a new day, spreading my wings
Taking shots of Crown cause I'm going through things
Everybody got they hands out looking for green
Coattails getting heavy cause I'm living my dream
I'm trying to school these young niggas it ain't all what it seems
I still struggle just like you, and I still hustle just like you
But it just so happens that Big Pooh doing what he love to do
Get back to my work, cause I was penning on this piece last night
That'll drive these niggas berserk
Tiggalo hit me up, Pooh its time to murk
Throw on a pair of sweats, A1's, a white shirt
Headed back to the shop, back to the spot where the hits keep coming
Stack them up like bricks, you can call me the mason of shit
Foundation has been rock solid no replacing, ya dig?
No replacing my nig, on everything that I live
We gonna let this bitch ride to our trains collide
Or we fall off track, and ain't no bringing me back
And everything that go for you the same applies to Pat

Cause even though the birds ain't singin' and the sun ain't shinin'
It looks like a beautiful morning

Each day's another chance to do the things I could've
Done the day before, but I didn't and I known I should've
So I say a prayer for the gone for gooders
Who left this world, then kiss my girl ""good mornin', shuga""
Another sunrise, and as much as I would love
To roll over on you I cannot do it because
The good Lord I prayed to him
And he said, ""Niggas is listening now""
So I better have something to say to 'em
So I'mma tell 'em how it went down, man
Doin' shows for free goin' outta town, man
The way I almost broke down and, got a 9 to 5
Cause I had more press than the soundscans
This is the price that I pay for this music
And every word that I write is a testament to it
And if I had to go back, I wouldn't change a thing
Wouldn't re-cut it, re-edit, or change a frame
Cause it would not be fair, to turn my back on the struggle
When that exact same hustle got me here
Told niggas from the getup, we three the hard way
And Broadway's the only place you'll ever throw a set up
Speechless is all you'd be if we ever met up
I survived far to much now to ever let up, motherfucker

Cause even though the birds ain't singin' and the sun ain't shinin'
It looks like a beautiful morning

I went from niggas tellin' me I really shouldn't rhyme

Ay, hol' up man, hol' up, ayo
Ayo, Imma do it over, hol' on",Beautiful Morning,2005
Little Brother,"I went from niggas tellin' me I really shouldn't rhyme
To droppin' a classic album muhfuckers couldn't find
Took my respect, took lessons and took the time
And if you want a success story, just take a look at mine
I was blessed with the right components, so precise
Cause I write so tight within the moment
And spit like my life depended on it
I target you herbs
On some teleprompter shit I got you watching your words
Tay rhymes are real life, yours are so 'for instance'
Taxin' these niggas like no dependents
12 bar courtroom drama with no co-defendants
Don't beat it off, come to your senses

Hard rock, my block is where you better be from
Top of the line, my team will never settle for crumbs
And he's hated, but still rated 2nd to none
I'm everything you wanna be but have yet to become

It all started back in '99 when time was hard
North Carolina Central but we called it the yard
Cause niggas wasn't trying to study abroad
They was trynna study a broad or two ir three up in the dorms
Met my nigga Chaundon and I started to ponder
""Fuck this, I'mma quit the football team tomorrow""
Did shows around town and word got around that battling Tay
Was like yelling 'spic' in Tijuana
Build my rep up, that's when Pooh and 9th stepped up
9th was old school, Pooh was young and playing catch-up
Cool, cause he could still rock an instrumental
Our first joints, yeah they was wack
But niggas could hear potential in 'em
Honing our skills for survival, hustling
Our flyers passed out like mamma at revival
The real deal on how I repped my peeps
You ain't goin' find this in no press release

Hard rock, my block is where you better be from
Top of the line, my team will never settle for crumbs
And he's hated, but still rated 2nd to none
I'm everything you wanna be but have yet to become

And ""he's shook""
That's what your team is telling me, son
Still hated, but still rated 2nd to none

I'm arrogant, outlandish
Blow your face out, and shake out the dandruff
The jakes won't make out the handprints
I'm as real as it gets, with the steel and the clips
Buck and make niggas duck, and kneel and do splits

It gets no realer than this
Its Tay and Elzhi dropping that definitive shit
This should have been a double album commemorative disc
Cause hip-hop might need us

Out, doin their damn thing like beavers

No I don't eat meat, but yes I'm still beefin

We only sleep on December the 32nd

Dealin' with their managers and program directors
And even though I try not to stress it
Sometimes it feels like a waste of time and not worth the effort

Naw but I won't let it
Put a block on my team's hustle for a second
Poobie keep it rushing, as long as Tay and I on the mic
And 9th is on the percussion, these fronting dudes can't say nothing
It was only time for we finally spoke out
Plenty cold nights ahead I suggest you get your coats out
No time to stand here lips poked out we bout to closeout that stored up doubt
And keep it moving

Its not enough for you

Took our wax to the station and they straight played us
That's how the game got contaminated
And now they sayin' we're at fault like the San Andreas

And still trying to play us
But not spin the record or disc
I got a fire burning deep that will not be extinguished
I mean this from the depths of my soul
People no more mind talk let my heart take control

And don't think cause we all here that its gonna be all we

No more I say gotta make'em pay
Cause I'm tired of getting stepsonned in the worst way just wait

Then come back home and still be called local

And it's feel good, you see us
I'm listening to The Minstrel Show (ha ha ha)
You ain't heard, it's the biggest colored show on earth

I'm overweight, rap is fat to death
Obese when these beats catch wind of my breath
And yes, you ain't heard you still rocking with the best
I just saved y'all from taking a guess
Not jeans, my dear
You ain't worthy to breathe my air
Or stand tall in the pair I wear
Am I making it clear
As the best to lay his head 'round here
And no I'm not the heir apparent to whoever

They never could out hit us (hit us)
Tried to think fast but never could out wit us (wit us)
The only thing they could ever do was outfit us
When clothes fit strange
I'm playin' Rick James
""Fuck yo' couch nigga!""
I'm comin' out with a bang
Straight Tay, Pooh, and 9th with no middle man
Everybody at the label asking ""will it bang?""
I say chill, 'just take a percocet or ritalin'
Now, let the people sing

10 G's a show
Whylin' out with pretty Tony and O
(We make'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make 'em wanna say it again)
Beats from Mr. Douthit
Fresh jeans, fresh clothes, and outfits (let me hear it)
(We make 'em wanna say it again, uhh yeah, we make 'em wanna say it again)

I got so many rhymes, many styles to go with
And my competition all the while be hoping
That I'll quit bringing the pain like Ibuprofen
I can't dog, can't you see that the crowd is open
I mean, mouths is open
Hands in the air, just so aroused and focused
This is a movement, nigga its bigger than showbiz
This is how I live it
I love hip hop, I just hate the niggas in it

It's like, I'm just another nigga rockin' the mic
That's way above average and take it however you like
However despite I'm left to write
'Till my forearms get all tight
And my fingers start cramping up
Pose ampin' up I'm standing, what
Y'all niggas ain't man enough, chill
Agitating like dandruff
I ain't talking all tough, but them people keep saying

Big trucks and wheels
Dominican broads that's cookin' my meals (right papito) one time
(We make'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make 'em wanna say it again) check it out
Niggas copy my style
Big Dho walking down the aisle (sing it to them)
(""She's your queen to be"")
Yeah, we make'em wanna say it again

Hey yo, they beggin' for a taste of it
Get a plate, grab a cup or something, my nigga stop frontin'
On a mission, dudes still hunting
So stay out my way, act like you want something

Yo, my girl's a grown woman who ain't tryna get her eagle on
She'd rather be in bed gettin' her Keagel on
In and out, working the walls when the heat is on
Like Mary J. or Tweet is on, now sing along

Fresh clothes and cribs
Gimme a salad pass 9th the ribs
(We make 'em wanna say it again, ooh we make 'em wanna say it again) now bring it back
Getting what's finally mine
Sign of relief, 'cause we finally signed (I'm home niggas)
(We make 'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make 'em wanna say it again)

Say it one more time for that girl named Pam Gram or that some black chic chick
She got me saying damn, damn
(You make me wanna say it again, you make me wanna say it)
Now say it one more time for my nigga named pretty Tony
That always come through it, the hoes that wanna know me (yeah)",Say It Again,2005
Little Brother,"Whatever goes around, comes around
Every lifetime is a lesson, this is what I found
No matter who you are (It don't matter), gonna have your ups and downs
(Time to come up, baby, time to come up, it's whatever)
Whatever goes around, comes around

Uh, yo, uh I walk, wit' a swag of a letterman
No amateur here, I'm a veteran
You couldn't find many more who is better than
Big Pooh when he rocking the mic
No games, no hype, just mind and skills
Pure determination and a heart full of will
My nigga Tiggalo held me down for real
But it's time now for me to ante up on the bills
Cause at the point when we signed our deal
I was three years young, now I'm five plus some
Write, to the beat of 9th's wonderful drum
Overhung by the snare and the bassline
It's face time, commentators they deface my
Place I pick up the pace, cause I belong here
Marathon man, outlastin the chariot
I got a bone to pick and 'bout to bury it

This letter goes out to whoever want read it (whoever)
Please share it with the world cause I won't repeat it (I won't repeat it)
Believe me, I know who all need it
So for you, I wrote this letter (check it out)
I woke up, wit' an epiphany (Whaaat?)
It's like this feelin came over me (WHAAAT?!)
Cause right is where I'm 'posed to be
So for you, I wrote this letter

Uh, yo I awoke wit' a lot on my chest
And every breath that I took wasn't gettin' any better, P
I swear, some niggas wish they could replace me
No bullshittin, I watched the rumors chase me
'til it had me in the corner, (back down)
I mean, my back against the wall yo, I thought I was a goner
I let the pressure get the best of -
I let words make a mess of what's left of my pride but
I refuse to hide, behind the silence and smiles
It's been a while though, you hearin me now
Remember every foul comment that you motherfuckers spoke?
Well, I Rakim these niggas now, I Ain't No Joke
This is no hoax, back to bench scrubs like Tremaine Foulks
Coast to coast, please put up a toast
For the most, slept on!
Better open your eyes 'fore yo' ass get crept on, surprise

Little Brother,"This some grown man shit right here 
Listen 

I'm trying to man up see what's really good with you 
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you 
Same things that you hear everyday like 
""Hey ma, hey boo, baby what's your name"" 
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came 
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same 
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name 
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same 
My occupation rap and I make a little change 
I see you not impressed with what this life brings 
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing 
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed 
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check 
With all due respect lets two-step in the name of like 
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like 

[Chorus] 
If love is not enough 
We don't have to rush 
Come around, I'll slow it down just you 
Lady you should be 
Right here next to me 
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you 

We can go to the movies 
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out 
Steady asking you questions what your life about 
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about 
No doubt this my life and 
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it 
Wasted time I can't afford 
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record.. 

I'll scoop you up in me Porshe, sike 
You know I got a Nissan 
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on 
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you 
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue 
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue 
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle 
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day 
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste 

[Chorus] 

Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach) 
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight) 
I want a girl, when I want a girl 
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that 
And that's some hard shit to explain 
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing 
Until I had to figure 
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down 
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers 
How his daddy and his uncles did it 
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it 
I know it sound fucked up and most won't admit it 
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it 
'Cause when the party stops and niggas get old 
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that 
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone 
So girl I'm trynna hold you

[Chorus] 

Oh baby (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
What you need to do is 
Take it slow with me 
Slow it down a little bit (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
We don't have to rush into anything serious 
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
No we don't, take it from me (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
My name is Percy and I make miracles if you take it slow with me baby 
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)",Slow It Down,2005
Little Brother,"Imagine, if this was the last rhyme I ever wrote
The last words that I ever spoke, no
I'm a keep servin' them
Cause its somebody out there, that never even heard of him
Or the songs I be murdering
Now it's a whole herd of men that follow in his footstep
I did it all to get a rep and it worked out
Now my sisters Kirk out when they hear me on the radio
Here we go with the steady flow
I'm the best since sliced bread but you already know
How it goes when, me and Te be composing
Over instrumentals 9th holding
We not hot niggas scolding, I told men
But it's only now you want to listen
So get close, please pay attention
Here's a few things I'd like to mention
The B the I the G the P the O the O the H
The is none greater
The L the B the J the L
Is here forever money so see me later
Stash away plenty sheets of paper
Shit is perfected and we hit the majors
See, I said you niggaz couldn't cage us
Them mere feeble attempts was outrageous
It aint a party 'til we hit the stages
Rapper Pooh signing off, see you in the funny papers
Ha, you can bet your life on it, you gon see me man come on

Rock, Rock and you don't
Freak, Freak and you don't
To the Beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
You think I will but I won't, stop
They think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
Big Pooh and he don't stop
And 9th Wonder he don't stop

Even though, most of our albums are poorly promoted
And all the magazines probably won't even quote it
J League never running or folding
We got tight to steal y'all spotlight and y'all won't even know it
One time for Big Pooh cause he quit eating steak
And two times for 9^th Wonder cause he setting it straight
And 3 times to that hoe from the 8-1-4
That moved in, got kicked out and caught on tape (ha,ha)
Just a little bit of time, is all that we granted on this planet
For us to get our little bit of shines
If y'all want to get a line, then talk to Big Dho
Cause ain't shit free but the spirit of my rhymes
I hear it all the time, LB ain't on the same ?
So innovative you the next best things, since, whatever
I just laugh wit it, cause today's fan is tomorrow's rap critic
One day they giving you the thumbs up the next
They telling 9^th to go on switch his drums up the best
Is what they expect, but why they won't let the music
Just be what it is is anybody's guess, so ah
If y'all feeling this y'all ain't gotta analyze it
This shit is dope so we ain't changin' up
Makin' money and our parents ain't ashamed of us
And when I think about that I can't complain as much so let it rock.

Raleigh gotta
Durham gotta
Chapel Hill gotta
Greensboro gotta
High Point gotta
Got a zone

Its for all y'all man

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
Its unique and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Think I will but I won't, stop
Think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't

Little Brother,"LB be'ness
Yeah, I go by the name of Khrysis
(My nigga Khrysis on the beat)
One half of the Away Team
And right now, you in tuned to the biggest colored show on earth
The Minstrel Show, nigga

I can't afford to not record
So, I call my nig' Khrysis, tell him, hit the boards
Then I call Tay put the pedal to the floor
'Fore we do the shop, gotta stop by the store

I'm on my knees, gotta go to the Lord
(Dear Father)
I pray to You, these niggas gon' pay for it

All them times that I went ignored
So, what it wasn't 20 but still I scored
My heart still scorned and my mind is focused
So, this serves as a warning to protest

Any verse disperse is sicker that the first and
'S no treatment for this disorder, Carolina's number one reporter
A nigga who's back with a vengeance better run for the border
(Run)
Or head for the hills or duck and seek cover
Who else gon' make it hot this summer? It's LB, nigga

They can't stop me, naw, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

They can't stop me, dawg, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

Uh, ain't no need in gettin' teary eyed
(Whoo)
Tay's the illest, point blank period
Plus, I got niggas , in DC
That'll hit you for 3G's and a box of Yum's carry out

Outlook lookin' scary now
They was frontin' before but now they seein' that we serious
This ain't a peace talk, so muhfucka, save your sweet talk
(Suite)
For reservations at the Marriott

They say birds of a feather often flock together
But me and Big Pooh rock together
And if not forever
I'ma reach to the sky and keep flyin' high like we got propellers

'Goddamn, y'all boys doin' it', they stop to tell us
And if God propel us to the top, I won't go pop
(Pop)
No need to act a fool in public
'Cause when you, ego trip you just lose your luggage and well
I ain't got no time top play with 'cha

I'm Phonte, international stage ripper done
Made friends and made figgas while you stuck on the front porch
Mad, like you fixin' ta shave Mister
(You fixin' to shave)
That's reality, so color me purple

My name in history, nigga, that's what I work for
Better keep it moving like the laws of inertia
Before these Carolina boys come hurt 'cha
Better tell 'em bout it

They can't stop me, naw, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

They can't stop me, dawg, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

And now The Minstrel Show is proud to present
Jazzy Jeff, Khrysis on the board with, with the heat

Little Brother,"Ye-yeah, one more time, one last number
Chaundon, where you at, nigga?
It's the future right here, man
We startin' it right now, let's get it goin', Big Pooh, uh

My attitude real shitty, temper short
My mind cluttered like the streets of New York
I ain't tryin' to take a ""L"" 'cause I casually fought
This shit, real serious not casual sport

Let time fly by as I pen these thoughts
And I'm speedin' through life wit my car in park
And even in the day sometimes it's dark
And that cloud hoverin' low is not the worst part

Second guessin' yourself, tryin' to remain sharp
See niggas blowin' up, who ain't got yo, spark, uh
And that alone is a burden to carry
Either you'll get strong or you'll get buried

And rap keep plenty room in the cemetery
Pull out your Blackberry's, change yo itineraries
I mean you could be the shit today
Then tomorrow wake up, fame blown away

And homey, on the real, ain't nothin' you can say
That's why I work hard now, got later to lay
In the sands on the beach, mixin' drinks wit Belvy
The world gon' remember my name, motherfuckers

Now they heard some of yo' songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

I tried to work with niggas, don't wanna jerk them niggas
But everybody runnin' around thinkin' they murderers
Gave birth to niggas and when I burp them niggas
The spit up old lines that I fed to them earlier

And this is what the state of hip-hop is like
I'm thinkin', ""Damn, this cannot be right""
And I agree that everybody's a biter but if you Xerox the style
Then that's infringin' on my copy, right?

It's the bottom of the 9th with no extra innings
And we all in the game tryin' to collect our pennants
And from the old school, I'm a direct descendant
And y'all can feel it at the end of each and every sentence

'Cause underground rap is just incense and gimmicks
An image, they phone in for ten cents a minute
I knew that since I entered, the rap game, my style
Would have niggas takin' it back but what about now?

I think about the youth and how their minds are so closed
'Cause now ""Rap City"" look like ""Video Soul""
And that's a sad state of affairs but no need to despair
'Cause we the next ones that's takin' it there, ya know

Now they heard some of yo songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

A note to my opponents, yeah, I got now
And I always got next 'cause I seize every moment
I'm an opportunist with ambition, keep an eye
On that number one spot before it wind up missin'

And the heart of this being is the art of MC-in'
I feel I'm God with the flow 'cause people started believin'
Huh, so what I'm cocky, who gon' stop me?
Twist hoes, leave 'em knock knead, smile for paparazzi

This is how I get down, got a crib in every hood
So I'm always the hottest nigga in town
Hate it or love it, who fuckin' with our music?
Yeah, y'all niggas are the shit when it comes to bowel movements

Pooh showed and proved it, can't sleep on his game
'Te converted all the currency with foreign exchange
Up next to rock the booth is a rapper named Chaundon
The Bronx Borough President with ""No Excuses""

Doubtin' me is foolish, don't ask who produced this
Knowin' damn well only 9th can do this, huh
It's no secret, Lyor even know
When me and Little Brother flow, it's guaranteed another video

Now they heard some of yo songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

On behalf of myself, Phonte, Big Pooh and 9th Wonder
And the whole cast of 'The Minstrel Show'
I wanna thank y'all for watchin' this shit
I ain't gon' front, only reason I took this job
'Cause I need the money, I don't need, yo, I ain't gon' front

I don't give a fuck if UBN pull the plug on me, dawg, I-I gotta be real
Y'all really wanna know how I feel about 'The Minstrel Show'?
Y'all really wanna know how I feel about UBN?

I was playin' this, this record
For a friend of mine y'knahmsayin we was just chillin'
I was just playin her the album and like
She was like, ""Yo I love the record, record is incredible
But y'know something's different
Y'knahmsayin somethin' it just ain't the same""
I said nigga that's the point~!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
My momma told me that this music was cool
All she ever wanted from me was to graduate from school
But I, had other plans so I bid school adieux
I called Food Lion, had to tell 'em I was through
No more stockin' peas and corn
I was born for a much greater purpose, do you this service
Margie got nervous, but timers don't sweat
8 years, I ain't been back yet
Lack of time on your TV sets, no radio spins
Momma askin' her son, what he doin' for ends
Spendin' weeks on the road, ma this ain't for pretend
Unheard to the creme de la creme, keep bouncin'
On beats pouncin', cat reflexes
Had yo' attention when I pulled up in Lexus
Big like Texas, G's on the checklist
You ain't gotta ask ma I'm bringin' home the breakfast
Gotta respect this

[Chorus]
(Momma I got dreams, but dreams don't keep the lights on)
I'm a make money money
And if I can't make it I'm a take money money
What you say buddy buddy?
(Momma I got dreams, but dreams don't keep the lights on)
Bills paid, bank account ensured
Top of the world screamin' fuck that, get yours!

[Phonte]
I still go the crib and see my niggaz on the corner
Chillin' with the pounds on they waist, gettin' old
Gettin' round in the face and when I hang with them
They ask me if ""The Minstrel Show"" means I'm ashamed of them
Well, I can't say that I'm proud, but only sayin'
Can't say I'm allowed to judge, I'm just glad to see you
Cause truth be told, if my records never sold
And I wasn't raised this bold, nigga I would probably be you
I've been God blessed with the gift to make music
It took me all over the continent
But still got boys on the block and fam, smokin' rock
So please, miss me with that conscious shit
I spent many a sleepless night because of it
Until I had to shake that shit off and reach the conclusion
That every now and then you gotta axe yourself
Do you really wanna win or just look good losin?
It's no illusion, yes yes

Uhh! Little Brother
Uhh! Mr. Porter
Uhh! Aiyyo Denaun this a
This a provocative-ass beat my nigga! I ain't gon' lie
Like, this shit so hard, it's so provocative
Before I could do it I had to go get a manicure, a pedicure
A cucumber melon facial wrap
And now nigga I'm spittin' this shit, I got on a raspberry colored mockneck
And some Babajeux cologne, Oh!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Chances are I've raised the bar
Never first at the finish but here I are
Niggaz gettin' out of hand 'til I raised the par
Yeah I took a few lumps, I don't easily scar
And after number two heard they tried to tar, but baby I'm back
Now I see folks tryin' to sit where I sat
Shakin' my hand like shit! It's like that?
And this is all fact

[Phonte]
All factual, all actual
Now they lookin' at me, eyes all glassy now
From the chicken-head hoes with the weaves and perms
To the coffee-shop bitches with the naturals
'Member when they didn't even wanna ask me out
Now they all wanna know how they can be down
Didn't think I'd make it rhymin', but I'm still grindin'
Look at 'Te shinin', are you happy now?

[Chorus: Rapper Big Pooh, Phonte]
Everybody say praise the lord
Ain't another like me, I swear to God
Everybody wanna be amongst the stars
So now I gotta go and do it extra hard

Yeah, steppin' out extra hard
New aim, new game, fresh feet on the car
Don't ever let a nigga tell you who you are
So when you gotta show 'em, go extra hard
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

Uh! Say I'm good, say I'm great

""The one thing that, the black audience realized, is when the tower fell
There were some changes. There was a change in societies, where where
All of a sudden they went from being, somewhat of the people still having a say
To now it's, whatever the masses do. So there's not even really a choice
That a black audience is being given.""

And they wonder why the fuck! we attracted to crime

Babies in the street die way before they time
Many single parent mothers packin welfare lines
And niggaz bein' donors, the apocalypse is on us
Niggaz take owners, that's all I ever asked
And got pegged as a hater, man they tryin'' to take niggaz
Out with the fader, started with three
Down to two-six later, back independent
Cause to kids I wouldn't cater

On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

and all I could do was cry.

rice has been thrown over their heads.

Hold me tight
Hold me near through the years
Through the fears, through the tears

With the crap they're dishin' out
You're the only one it seems
To make it all work out
And you're always by my side
Puttin' up with foolish pride
When the day to day fiascoes
Only multiply
You're the heart, you're the soul
When the world takes its toll

When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
In your arms
In your arms

With my back against the wall
When you keep standing tall
When I stumble, you are
Always there to break my fall
When I'm far away from home
I can call you on the phone
When I hear your voice
Then certainly I'm not alone
All the words that you say
Make the miles drift away

I'm very sorry feelings just aren't my thing
I never waited on the things that I wanted
Conscience and cowardice are still the same thing

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And though I'm really not the type you can talk to
It seems it's cute that I have nothing to say
I only smile and do my best to undress you
It's not protection I was programmed this way
So if you're counting that we all have a conscience
I'll be hanging out with all of your friends
'Cause baby I put the con in confidence
And I'll only leave you down in the end

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And if you cut me open

Little Dragon,"Your head aches and you’ve had no rest
This day's been a one long test
Years pass too fast, have to stop
Like an angel she appears

Created out of air
And all you troubles, all your fears
Like blown away

‘Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back

The swarm of heads turn around
And cross the street, oh
Waves of electricity, you feel the heat
You start walking fast
And blindly you’re like an ant in a stack

And years pass too fast
Yet in your dreams, you know

‘Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back

When skies are dark
You got me flying, way beyond.

You put a spell on me.

Have been dragging
My feet along sleepless everyday,
I couldn't figure out a thing.
Until your lightbeam
Came crashing in
Waited five seconds,
Soaked in some magic, shoot across
To transform my every loss,
But then you came storming.
You are my sunbeam
When skies are dark
You got me flying way beyond.

Now, like whirlwind,

Your electric ways had me right
Then Me and my ghost of The past,
Get him tied down.

Why must I be denied the thrill of your kiss
What did I do to you to be treated like this
Why must I spend another night with the boys

Little Feat,"Off our rockers, actin' crazy 
With the right medication we won't be lazy 
Doin' the old folks boogie 
Down on the farm 
Wheelchairs, they was locked arm in arm 
Paired off pacemakers with matchin' alarms 
Gives us jus' one more chance 
To spin one more yarn 
And you know that you're over the hill 
When your mind makes a promise that your body can't fill 
Doin' the old folks boogie 
And boogie we will 
'Cause to us the thought's as good as a thrill 
 
Back at the home, 
No time is your own, 
Facillities there, they're all out on loan 
The bank forclose, and your bankruptcy shows 
And your credit creeps to an all-time low 
So you know, that you're over the hill 
When your mind makes a promise that your body can't fill 
 
Try and get a rise from an atrophied muscle, 
And the nerves in your thigh just quivers and fizzles 
So you know, that you're over the hill 
When your mind makes a promise that your body can't fill",Old Folks Boogie,1977

Well, they say time loves a hero 
But only time will tell 
If he's real, he's a legend from heaven 
If he ain't, he was sent here from hell

Just make sure it's the truth that you're seein' 
Eyes sometimes lie, eyes sometimes lie 
They can be real deceivin' 

I got an Uncle in Puerto Rico 
Spends his days in the sun 
His nights in the casinos 
He left the States many years ago 
Took a fishin' boat to Puerto Rico 
Now my aunt - she is sad and lonely 
She'll never know that she drove him away 
As a coward I admire his courageous ways 

[Chorus]

Some say my uncle - that he's a zero 
His life is as a shell; he left it back at Stateside 
I'd say he's doin' pretty well without his shell 
Bumming 'round the beaches of Puerto Rico 

The beauty of the sunrise and sunset 
To his friends he wish he could tell 
They're at home still runnin' for bells 
Better San Juan than that blue collar hell

Little Feat,"Well the night that was high, we got into town
Was the night that the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon

Well I stepped inside, and stood by the door
While a dark-eyed girl sang, and played the guitar
Hookers, and hustlers, filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon

One false step, you get done in
It's a cold situation
If that -- that don't -- kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon

I pawned my watch, and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl singing, (hear that girl sing)
Don't take long, to wake up ruined
The women will down at the Spanish Moon",Spanish Moon,1978

Little Feat,"Well, he was the assistant preacher and the Sunday school teacher
In the church that I grew up in
She was looker from Atlanta, led the choir, played piano
Had a body that was made for sin
She didn't care that he was married, cause the torch that she carried
Was hotter than the fires of hell
She had plans to seduce him, if she could, she could loosen
A notch in the Bible Belt
So, she called him up at home when she knew he'd be alone Said, 'Preacher I could use advice,
I got troubles with a man that I know you'll understand
If you could help me it would sure be nice'
They met a few minutes after in the office of the Pastor
And she started telling how she felt
What a chance they were takin' when they first started breakin'
The laws of the Bible Belt

There's a lot of good people who are led astry
That believe what the good Book said
Well, I'll tell ya somethin' brother when you're dealin' with the Devil
It's tough to keep a level head
And it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion
Can burn you till your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer but you're gonna have to answer
To the Lord and the Bible Belt

Someone said they went to Vegas, back home it didn't take us long
To hear the news of what they did
Nobody could believe that he left his wife to grieve
Alone with two pre-school kids
I don't know how they're doin' but I know that they're screwin' up
A good thing they once had
They better get their heads together or they're gonna slap leather

It was just a matter of time
I didn't see the signals
I was driving blind, driving blind

Got bombs in my pocket
Got dreams in my head
Everyday feels like the 4th of July
Everything's painted cherry red

Somewhere in middle America
I'm standing in the rain
Gonna try to walk on water
Find somebody that feels the same

Roll down the window
The freeway is clear
Suddenly all my passions re-appear

I know the power of innocence
Learned the meaning of fate
Rode a dream all the way down to the ocean
Watched it tumble in the waves

Perseverance pulls me
It's gonna take me way
I want it so badly
This time I can't be saved, I can't be saved

Ain't no curve that I can't handle
Ain't no mountain I can't climb
To be young and foolish
Shouldn't be a crime
With my heart wide open
Just a matter of time
Didn't see the signals
Couldn't read the signs, I was driving blind

Little Feat,"She don't look like her mother 
Nothing like her father
How else can you explain it must be something in the water

Pig tails, overalls, freckles on her face
Skinny as a toothpick turned side ways, 
Something happened to her when she turned sixteen, 
From a little Dixie Chicken to a Mississippi Queen, 

She spent her days a fishin' with a bamboo cane 
Every night skinny dippin' in the Pontchartrain
If you were living breatin', had two feet
You would be stalking that girl cause she looked so sweet

You could always find her when the night time fell, 
Drinkin' of a bucket from an old stone well, 
Drinking from her hand, 
Dancing to the moon, 
She don't look like her mother, nothing like her father, 
How else can you explain it must be something in the water. 

I never will forget that look in her eye
The night she took me down to the riverside, 
She wrapped herself around me like a honey suckle vine
An let me have a taste of wild cherry wine
You could always find her when the nighttime fell 
Drinking of a bucket from an old stone well
Drinking from her hand 
Singing to the moon
She don't look like her mother
Nothing like her father
Folks round here say it's something in the water

Two straight months without any rain
I never ever saw that girl again
But I still got her picture
Burning in my head
Dancing in a downpour 
Soaking wet
You could always find when the night time fell
Drinking of a buck of an old stone well
Drinking from her hand howling at the moon
She don't look like her mother nothing like her father
How else can you explain it must be something in the water
She don't look like her mother nothing like her father

Little Feat,"Well the night that was high, we got into town
Was the night that the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon

Well I stepped inside, and stood by the door
While a dark-eyed girl sang, and played the guitar
Hookers, and hustlers, filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon

One false step, you get done in
It's a cold situation
If that -- that don't -- kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon

I pawned my watch, and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl singing, (hear that girl sing)
Don't take long, to wake up ruined
The women will down at the Spanish Moon",Spanish Moon [Album Version] [Version],2011
Little Feat,"Well all you ladies gather 'round
That good sweet candy man's in town
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

He likes a stick of candy just nine inch long1
He sells as fast a hog can chew his corn
It's the candy man...

All heard what sister Johnson said
She always takes a candy stick to bed

Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand

He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had

You sure will want it for a long long time

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Another MC spits a puny verse
I try to get through my day without sayin' a curse
Because I curse too much and such and such

I try to improve my vocabulary
I try to cut out eatin' meat and dairy
I wanna bring back the days of the tooth fairy
'Cause I lost my innocence

I'm young and dumb and old and wise at the same time
'Cause I know Jesus was a rock star
And it was Elvis who turned water into wine
I wanna save a kangaroo from a life in a zoo
I wanna own a llama, I want less drama in my life
I think I really wanna be a happy housewife

I gotta pace myself, I'm smokin' like a chimney

When I was swiggin' my Bacardi
28 butts in the ashtray because it's just me
Keepin' myself company

I think back all the days I was smokin' carawhack
It was really kinda like an addiction, non fiction
Just readin' my days and nights away
I used to pray to a funny little fat man
'Til I found out he was Santa Clause
'Cause Saint Nick never brought shit
And there I go cursin' again

I'm my only friend and I'm definitely my very worst enemy
It kinda triggers a memory, let's bring it back to 83
When I ate a watermelon, swallowed the seeds
Suddenly there was a watermelon growin' in my tummy
I skipped a jump rope, every time I jumped up
I heard a rattle that sounded like a tambourine

But I know I taste better than that
Like they used to taste before they outlawed trans fat

Every third day, thugs be comin' around
They been sent the way 'cause we were bound
To bear the burden of what went down

It was our business
Even if it hurt we were self righteous
Social services parked outside
Tried to take us away
Mama wouldn't abide, na, na, na

A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

Why your hair all messy'
Why you look so ill'
Couldn't pay the water bill

Had to keep the light on for the homework

I trivialize 'cause the truth hurts
So much more than a little dirt

It's a lot more noble than a suicide

We survive, we alive, we got pride
We be tight
You know we ride to a certain degree
To keep that shit in the family

We get a little bit closer every time we ride
A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

That's how we roll in my family

Ain't never really dissipates
May take my whole life to get it straight
But it makes me who I am

Little Jackie,"I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

One day I passed by your apartment
Thinking that I'd catch some girl
Kiss you goodbye with a lingering kiss
I know we broke up, I'll get out of this faze

My imagination gets the best of me
You end up getting the rest of me
The obsessed, crazy, drama queen
If you know what I mean

Anyway, you're never there
You could be anywhere
On an airplane, maybe in a car
On a world tour being a superstar

I liked you better
When you didn't know no better
You didn't think that I was
I was the Antichrist

I liked you better
Before you got a stylist
When friendship bracelets sufficed
But now your wrists are iced

I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

Five stitches of breaking up started with denial
Fuck, we were just taking off for a while
Thought it was permanent
Better get myself some anger management

Bargaining was the next faze
Gave my word that I changed my ways
I swear to God, I'll be a freakin? little angel
Please just stop putting me through hell

But he didn't buy what I was selling
I spent about a month on Saturn
Dwelling on the past, at last it occurred to me
You didn't give a damn, time to get with the program

I liked you better
When you weren't popular
Before your friends started calling me
The psycho bitch

Trends didn't matter to you
But now you're all into the way you look
Your iPhone ringing off the hook
And my new ring tone
Is the theme of the wicked witch

I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

It's like night and day, it's like Jekyll and Hyde
I've created a monster, it's alive
I miss the person I was before I became possessed
And the object of everything you detest

For too long now, there were things I should have said

A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

I will share the pain with you
How else can I say I love you?

When your heart's not feeling blue
I'll be there to laugh for you
I'll do my best my whole life through
How else can I say I love you?

With each word that I speak
I'll speak of your charm
Each moment in life
Let me spend in your arms

When you're alone, nothing to do
And no one to turn to
I'll be hope when you cry
I'll be breath if you sigh
I'll be yours till I die

How else, how else
How else can I say I love you?

So I have invented my own
Darling, this place is a lover's oasis
Where life's weary chase is unknown

Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers, pretty, caress the streams
Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends and relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known that we have a telephone

Dear, day will break, you'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For to take, for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be?

But I got drunk and I woke up rolled

I wake up from a slumber, in a smile

This face, it must be kept at all costs
Like a statue in a window or everything is lost

Well hey you got me right where you want me
Well hey you got me right where you want me
You knock me out, but you still haunt me
Well hey you got right where you want me, to be

I go and hide, behind the barricades of our time
I've learned just how to run without runnin'
Most of us walk around, believin' this struggle is sound
But I don't believe, I could swim in a sea of gold

We were drinking champagne punch and homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him until he sang
Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad

Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins from his second wife Mary Neil
Of course he brought his new wife Kay
Who talks all about AA
Chain smoking while the stereo plays Noel, Noel

Cook the Turkey
Turn the ball game on
Mix margaritas when the eggnog's gone

A box of tampons and some Marlboro Lights
Halleluja everybody say Cheese

Fred and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw a breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night, Silent Night, Oh Silent Night

Cook the turkey turn the ball game on
Make Bloody Mary's 
Cause We All Want One!

Little Larry,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

We could fake the world out (x3)

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

People try to tell me, ""Stop crying, and find you someone new
'Cause when that good Lord made one woman
Hallelujah, don't you know he made two?""

But I can't let her go, I'm hooked, I can't let her go
I can't let her go, Lord, I can't let her go

He lifted up his head toward Heaven and said
""Good Lord, I'd rather die than to let a no good
A no good cheating woman
Make me stand on the corner and cry""

Lord knows I'm living in a world of darkness
But that don't, that don't bother me
And until I find that sweet little girl of mine
Lord knows, I just don't want to see

You could try smooth in between and you can scream
Sound while the crowd won't bounce to that
And you be fucking up the room,
Changing up mood

And my thugs want to eat your food
Drinking milk shake and after that shit in your face
And let your bitch know there been a car bomb from the git
Blow the day you blow Shaq make all his free throws
Let him throw a finger fucking fast or slow
Even put it in your ass if you tell me so
Toe to toe, you can lose your deal and your hoe
Now it's hard to pay your carton note and buy you some smoke
Seen your man is 'convensary' now, he starting to worry
He said stay away from Bing and 118
They really put it down, really put niggas in the ground
And your really love me if you only got a beat down

To bang with Bing in two bars, I can spoil your dream
Get mean, I could lead to things
Like me coming for you, in the middle of the night
With all black on, all you can see is the red light
The fo fo special got you hoping God bless you
Girl, won't forget you, once the bullets start the get you,
Games over soldier, don't you see the fucking Range Rover
With Bing in it, 10 more, 12th and 118 in it
I started rappin cause there's cream in it
But I still keep the crack, how for five or six fiends in it
A ring with the Bling Bling in it
And my brand new truck, bitches like the way I lean in it
Stop at the Stome, leave the keys in it
Gave you to leave with it, Bing will make you believe in it
You got a gut, put some trees in it

Need a hard rock between your legs, I see the red spot
Thug knot, all it takes is one shot to make your head rock
Take you out your spot
While in the Woodstock, ask about Bing on the block
Fuck the cop, sell crack in blue top
Niggaz the size of dimes, ya'll cowards must be outta ya mind
Thinking that Dave Bing won't shine
This ain't the first time I cut head wrong with 1 9
Find the lactose slope, mix it in with the coke

Slept through to Monday.
Oh. Why Can't it all just go away.
If life was a simple.
Think and tremble
But things don't always turn out that way.

Come down my angel.
Come and help me fly.
Come down my sweet angel and tell me why.

Lonely highways.
A cry to stay awake.
But you give me hope
Look back to see you
Before the nights through
Oh I can never feel alone

Come down my angel.
Come and help me fly.
Come down my sweet angel and tell me why.

We know,
That life goes by,
By just like the wind
And I

Come down my angel.
Come and help me fly.

I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

From the California to the New York island

I saw above me that endless skyway
And saw below me that golden valley

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me , a voice was sounding

In the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting

Maybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy

Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so

Why
Why

Maybe I'm right
Maybe he's wrong
And maybe what he's saying is the way it should be
Somebody tried to explain it to me
But they couldn't tell me if he's happy
And I just want to know if he's still happy

Standin' to my Daddy's knee,
My poppa said, ""Son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me.""
'Cause he'll get you,
'Cause he'll get you now, now.
And I can remember the fourth of July,
Runnin' through the backwood, bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin',
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.

Chorus:
Down on the Bayou;
Down on the Bayou;
Down on the Bayou.

Wish I was back on the Bayou.
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen.
Wishin' I were a fast freight train,
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans.

Oh get back boy.

Were never to be

Little Richard,"Down around the corner in a little school
Children learn their lessons and the golden rule
'Cause they got a teacher up from Basin Street
And she does her teaching with a boogie beat
Teaching the ABC with rhythm and E
Every single morning, it's the same old thing
All the kids are waiting for the bell to ring
When they hear it ringing, they all jump in line
Walking to the classroom, feeling mighty fine
They learn their ABC with rhythm and E
Well, a-reading, writing, arithmetic
Taught to the tune of a liquorice stick
No education is ever complete
Without a boogie-woogie-woogie beat, well all reet
When the day is over and it's time to go
The children get their books and stand right at the door
Teacher is so happy, because she's done her bit
To educate the kids and make 'em really fit
To say their ABC with rhythm and E
