Death Cab for Cutie,"Seems you finally found, finally found El Dorado
Over in Culver City, shining bright naming lights

And I tried to be kind for you
Oh I'm trying to be kind for you, oh

It's kinda like a party that you never wanted to attend
But when an invitation finally arrives you change your mind

And I tried to be kind for you
Oh I'm trying to be kind for you
As you slip away behind the gates
Behind the gates

Seems you finally found, finally found El Dorado
So why does it feel underwhelming there be real

And I tried to be kind for you
Oh I'm trying to be kind for you
As you slip away behind the gates
Behind the gates

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado",El Dorado,2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"Way way down a hole, there's no feeling
'Cause when you're so far below the floor, everything's a ceiling
We dug it down as deep as we could just like we planned it
But when you climbed out you pulled the ladder and it left me stranded

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new

So far down in this hole, there's little daylight
I feel the shards of the midday sun and then it's black as midnight
The only stars I see in the sky, they don't move me
'Cause they've all been dead for millions of years,
They're just light diffusing

And the constellations move
And the brightest point is falling
But every telescope
Was pointed only at you

And I've got nowhere to go except further below
So I keep digging
And it gets darker everyday
But I see no other way than just committing

And if the earth is as round as they say
Then I won't find another place
From where I break back through
It's farther away from you
It's farther away from you

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new
Digging with someone new
Digging with someone new",Everything's a Ceiling,2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"If only you'd have known me before the accident
For with that grand collision came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded, they burst and disconnect
'Til there was little feeling please work with what is left

Oh I need not be flattered that you've never been here before
So there's no need to mention that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline I'll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble that looked safe from far away

I don't know why, I don't know why
I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind
Through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know what I expect to find
Where all the news is second hand
And everything just goes on as planned

You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants

I don't know why, I don't know why
I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind
Through the ghosts of Beverly Drive

Death Cab for Cutie,"You'll never have to hear the word ""no""
If you keep all your friends on the payroll
The non-disclosure pages signed
Your secret's safe between those lines
The scaffolding will cheer and console you
But remember what your mother told you
That good help is so hard to find
For people that are so refined

You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid

There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
""Only a fool gives it away""
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away

You said you wanna stake out your claim
High above the city from where you came
Don't you know the air's so thin?
It starves the brain of oxygen
I know it's such a dangerous place
For there are more ascensions than there is space
Angels causing accidents
The camera phones'll document
But if I start to levitate
Pull me down with all your weight

There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
""Only a fool gives it away""
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away

You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid
But you should know it's not ideal
All those hands upon the wheel

There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
""Only a fool gives it away""
There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
""Only a fool gives it away""
Only a fool would give
Only a fool would give
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives this away",Good Help (Is So Hard to Find),2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"Darling, don't you understand
That there are no winners
Metals rung from silken strands
To greet you at the finish
As we're dissolving into the sea
I can only take what I can carry
The counsel's combing through our debris
The treasures we never buried

My love why do you run?
For my hands hold no guns

Darling, though you may pretend
Pretend that you are selfless
You break with but the slightest bend
It leaves you lost and helpless
So to whom will you place the call
In the coldest night of winter?
'Cause numbers change and people fall
And friends they always splinter

My love why do you run?
For my hands hold no guns

My love why do you run?
For my hands hold no guns
They hold no guns
No, not a one",Hold No Guns,2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"(Lalalalalala)
Ingénue, what have we done to you?
Under that soft skin
I hear a ticking
The currency of being twenty-three
It turns from gold to dust
When you crest the wave of lust
So take all you can
From the mouth of man

Ingénue framed like a cartoon
The borders clear and defined
The colors bold and bright

You'll want to be taken more seriously
But they just play a cue
And it's such a hard thing to do
So take all you can
From the mouth of man
And escape from this town
Before your sand runs out
Before your sand runs out

Ingénue, what will become of you?
When age's glacial pace
Cuts valleys into your face
The currency of being twenty-three
It will remain the same
Just by another name
Oh, Ingénue
What will you do?
Oh, Ingénue
What have we done to you?",Ingenue,2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"You sent a photo out your window of Tokyo
Told me you were doing fine
You said the cherry blossoms were blooming
And that I was on your mind
But I couldn’t make you out through the glitches
It’s how it always seems to go
So we say our goodbyes over messenger
As the network overloads
When the network overloads

You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
Back to me

Always fall asleep when you’re waking
I count the hours on my hands
Doing the math to the time zone you’re at
Is an unseen part of the plan
But if you’ll be my bluebird returning
Then I’ll be your evergreen
Standing tall on your horizon
Guiding you home to me
Guiding you home to me

You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
How I wish that you could see
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
How I need you back with me
Back with me

You sent a photo out your window of Paris
Of what you wish that I could see
But someone’s gotta be the lighthouse
And that someone’s gotta be me
And I hope your absence makes us grow fonder
I hope we always feel the same
When our eyes meet past security,
We embrace in the baggage claim
When we kiss in the baggage claim

You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
How I wish that you could see

Death Cab for Cutie,"I don't know where to begin
There's too many things that I can't remember
As I disappeared like a trend
In the hum of the 5 in the early morning

And now I'm taking my time
Up through Coalinga through the valley
This highway lived in my mind
It takes me back to the place that made me

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

You cannot outrun a ghost
Speeding south bound lanes with abandon
It catches you on the coast
Or on the cliffs of the Palisades you killed the engine

And then it hovers above
Reeling bodies failing to discover
The thing they once knew as love
Raising their voices to convince one another

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

How can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true

And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else
With someone else

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

How can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true

And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else",No Room in Frame,2015
Death Cab for Cutie,"You've haunted me all my life
Through endless days and countless nights
There was a storm when I was just a kid
Stripped the last code of innocence

You've haunted me all my life
You're always out of reach when I'm in pursuit
Long winded then suddenly mute
And there's a flaw in my heart's design
For I keep trying to make you mine

You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life

And so I wait but I never seem to learn
How to capture your diminishing returns
I still see you through the eyes of a child
Not even thinking we could tame the wild

You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life

Death Cab for Cutie,"There's nothing funny about just slipping away
It's nothing funny how you're spending your days
But you're laughing like a kid at a carnival
And I watched you stumbling around this dusty town
I heard your bottle talking way too loud
As the Federales tried to hunt you down
For something you can't remember what was about

The curtain falls to applause and the band plays you off, the band plays you off
He's a superhero growing bored with no one to save anymore

I used to watch you on the late night scene
The timely rescue of a metal teen
Six strings were strumming rhythm and lead
And that hadn't occurred to me
When I met you I was twenty-two
Trying so hard to play it cool
But there was so much that I needed to say
And nothing came out the right way

The curtain falls to applause and the band plays you off, the band plays you off
He's a superhero growing bored with no one to save anymore
The curtain falls to applause and the band plays you off, the band plays you off
He's a superhero growing bored with no one to save anymore

There's nothing elegant in being a drunk
It's nothing righteous being sixty and a punk
But when you're looking in the mirror do you see
That kid that you used to be?
Broke and working in a record store
Daydreaming about the upcoming tour
Were you happier when you poor?
Were you happier when you poor?

The curtain falls to applause and the band plays you off, the band plays you off
He's a superhero growing bored with no one to save anymore
The curtain falls to applause and the band plays you off, the band plays you off
He's a superhero growing bored with no one to save anymore",60 & Punk,2018
Death Cab for Cutie,"No more lighthouses to deceive me
Just leave me floating on the open ocean
And let the moonlight take me anywhere on a tidal flow
And if I capsize it's alright
'Cause I've been feeling too invincible
I need to know depths deeper than the deepest of connections

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

If there's no beacon tonight to guide me
I'll finally break the shackles of direction
And let the headlights lead me anywhere they wanna go
I feel at home now out on a bough
In the lattice of the backbone
Where the highways are holding in the pieces of our broken hearts

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

I love the way, I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way you move
Just lose yourself
Lose yourself in circles of sound

Knowing, the way that we are feeling
You told me that we'd turn clean, that we'd turned clean
Talking, taking advantage
The other side of your dreams, of your dreams

Don't tell me this is precious
Don't tell me this is soulful
Well you have to be
Have to be kidding me on

No and don't stop, don't stop believing
Just keep on, keep on, keep on believing it's here

And I think you ought to know
I'm a murderer

I have a portrait on my wall
He's a serial killer
I thought he wouldn't escape

We live in a cemetery
A cold and damp place
And science runs through us
Making us Gods

The rules are all Wrong
Every perversion is justified
They honestly believe dead bodies
Anything goes around here

They search for their kind
Desperate eyes in silver skin, the poison glides in veins of tin
They search for their time

The grounds are filled with razors and snow, the people flee and the insects glow
They are coming for you
Sleep in the fields, earthly dolls, the woods are burning and the cities fall
And the rivers defile

You will cover their needs, they will crush all your creeds
We are the servants and we worship their deeds

All their diamond claws
And their golden jaws
Earth's all living things grow asphalt wings

They hide in the hills, a new breed moves with human skills
They want to be free
Watch their nature rust to red, snakes are crawling in virgins' beds
Their spawn will now see

The trees are torn from the rain and roar, the buildings fall into the city's floor
It will never end
Flocks are hunted on concrete plains, the scythe is there and it's counting names
And you will descend

You will cover their needs, they will crush all your creeds
We are the servants and we worship their deeds

All their diamond claws
And their golden jaws

She can tell you who's hot
Who will make it and who will not

She loves to hear them say

Sometimes they take her home
But she always wakes up alone

Men that want to marry her
Never satisfied
In rythms that she hears
All that keeps her high

And leave her by her radio
She didn't love 'em anyway
Not like she loves the men who play

Sometimes they take her home

Will soon become unstrung

She'll be just another face
Out of town and out of place
When the songs revive again
She'll come to life and tell them when

Is like the first time
Each time you're near me 
The thrill is new
And there is nothing 
That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight 
Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Deb Talan,"We did not ask how things were defined
Some pieces were missing but the puzzle looked fine
One day we looked up from inside a song
Something felt more right 
Something was wrong

Shouldn't we regret love like this?
It's not a shame its tenderness
But we made a mess
And that is how we'll be remembered here
That is how we'll be remembered here

Months go by you with your wife 
It takes time to disassemble a whole life
And I can't ask you for anything I take what I get 
Aren't other people and saints more than I deserve
Or maybe it's true I don't deserve you

Should I regret a love like this?
It's not a shame its tenderness
But we made a mess
And that is how we'll be remembered here
That is how we'll be remembered here

It's the end of an era so unexpected
Clear as the line on the palm of your hand
You and I we started stumbling
Into the next dance we didn't plan this
Death of our friends in sand

We can't regret a love like this
It's not a shame its tenderness
But we made a mess
And that is how we'll be remembered here
That is how we'll be remembered here",Tenderness,2000

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance

That you were here with me
And we were in each others arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
""Let's build a life together
Share love beyond compare""

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (it was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, of simple fantasy
That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

The day you left
You said you would return
Just when you wouldn't promise
Said you needed time alone
You said you loved me and
Someday our love could be
I couldn't understand it
I thought we were both happy

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (it was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

Hold me
Love me
With all your heart

Ohh come back
Please make my dream come true for me

That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more",A Dream,1983

There's nothing I wouldn't do to be in his shoes somehow

And I keep wondering who's holding Donna now

Tell me this is just a dream when I wake up she'll be here next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was

""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2005
Debbie Duncan,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.

Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Never knowing you'd be mine

Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
what love was, what love was

I need you, oh I need you
And everyday I love you more and more
Without you (dreams and tears)
I know what it's all for
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's ok

Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)

Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody?
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?

Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

I won't nurse it
I don't buy psyche - so why reverse it?

Games are good for attention (Mmm-yeah!)
But in the end they let you down
Hold me back or let me go
But no more middle ground

Boy, you've got to play your cards right
Get on back to the basics of love
We don't need no mindless mind games
A little give and take - push and shove -
A little honesty is what I'm in need of!

Don't you know I've seen it all
Though I seem naive to you
(So now) Hit me with anything at all -
Just hit me with the truth - yeah!

You keep thinking one of these days you'll
Push my back against the wall (against the wall)
It's too late for tricks of the trade now
I can escape anything at all - oh!

We're snuggled up together

Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Oh pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember
All through our lives!

I know the words to this song
You might tear us apart
But I'll still have my heart

You can't break me, you can only free me
Think I'm stuck like glue? You're wrong
You can't break me, you can only free this heart

There's a whole world of life with a promise of love
That's waiting outside of these four walls
And you can't walk away though you feel your heart break
Suddenly freedom calls
I've been searching for something I've yet to see
I've been thirsting for what you can't be
Now I need to be free

Debbie Gibson,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow,1995
Debbie Gibson,"Lost all reality, you've really got a hold
Turned myself over 2 you body, mind, and soul
It might seem crazy and though I'm in over my head
Got no direction and my world is spinnin' 'round
Feel like I'm risin' up and never comin' down
A million people talk but I don't hear a word they say

[Chorus]
Don't know what 2 do, nothin' I can do
I'm losin' myself over you
(And it hurts me so right)
Can't deny it's true
you know I couldn't fight it baby even if I wanted 2
I'm losin' myself, over you
Love like the ocean feel it rushin' over me
You are the treasure that I've searched 4 desperately
The tide it races in, it's pullin' me out 2 the sea
Willingly
You're my celebration boy, the reason I exist
I feel a hundred lifetimes deep within your kiss
Don't say a word just hold me close
I hear your heart talkin' 2 me
Secretly

[Chorus]
And when the darkness came
you washed away the pain
you can do anything when it comes 2 me
I won't hold back
I want 2 know no shame
Take me away in the sky","Losin' Myself [12"" Masters at Work Version]",1996

So I can free myself in the cool night air

Moonchild, love it when your light shines down on me
Moonchild, want someone to dance the dream
Moonchild, wrap me up beneath the stars

Or freckle on the nose of life's complexion

And seven mothers faint

And yet letting our grown up pride
Hide all the need inside

They're the luckiest people in the world

I've been down that road

Holding my ground and it kills me
'Cause you're so cool to be around
When you're around
But I think you've lost you
And I think of other lovers lost
And the soul wrenching cost
And I'd rather have you in my life, yeah

But empowered just the same
High on the pain that I'm saying no to

I won't follow you
I will walk away
While I still can call you a friend

Led me down the garden path
Then who's left with the aftermath
And it doesn't add up
It's a mixed equation
Was in for the long haul
Yeah you were my all-in-all
Guess I was your recreation

Sometimes you swim and swim
Expecting to see something more
And your whole soul gives out
Before you reach the shore
Sometimes you swim
And you see nothing more

I love you.

Twice on the pipe if the answer is no.
Oh, my sweetness,(knock) means you'll meet me in the hallway,
Twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show.

If you look out your window tonight,
Pull in the string with the note
That's attached to my heart,
Read how many times I saw you,
How in my silence I adore you,
And only in my dreams
Did that wall between us come apart.

But when I tried to push you away
You said you didn't think I'd want it that way

Not maybe so or what's in between

People think they get what they deserve

If any girl rejects you
Don't you doubt it's part of the plan

Debbie Gibson,"Baby, all the songs on the radio
Seems they're playin' too fast
Or they're playin' too slow
Nothin' seems right

Since you walked out of my life
Love's a lost feeling
That cuts just like a knife in my heart
Darlin' emptiness surrounds me now

And chains are all around me tonight
And I'm bound to your love
But when push comes to shove
It seems just like an endless fight, so tell me

Do you have it in your heart?
To give another try before we say goodbye to love
So that we can try again baby
Do you have it in your heart? Am I losin' my mind?
Maybe I was too blind to see
That our love could ever end
But baby, if you have it in your heart
You will never part from me

Just the other night at the movie show
I saw you from a distance but you didn't know
Though time has passed, I can still read your face
I could tell that girl, she made you feel so out of place

Boy I know, though we said goodbye forever I know
We could never let our dreams die
'Cause I'm looking around, I don't like what I found
Boy won't you look me in the eye and tell me

Do you have it in your heart?
To give another try before we say goodbye to love
So that we can try again baby
Do you have it in your heart? Am I losin' my mind?
Maybe I was too blind to see
That our love could ever end
But baby, if you have it in your heart
You will never part from me

Let's put our pride aside and try to be strong
So we can put the pieces back where they belong
Baby, I'm losin' sleep and I'll be losin' much more
If you don't walk back through my heart's door

I've been so lost lately 
I don't really understand baby 
Where did I go wrong 
I wanna talk to you 
Please call 

Where do I begin with you 
After all that we've been through 
I don't think that it would be right if we 
Got together so suddenly 

I wish that I could take back all the things that I said 
And replace them with simply I love you instead 
 
You don't wanna say goodbye

And if you need me then tell me why 
 
Girl, I never meant to say goodbye 
Mmm Oh yeah 
 
I think about the past baby 
Why we couldn't make it last, lady 
I know you still have doubts 
But I'm gonna prove that we can work things out 

I wanna be sure that you know what you put me through 
And reveal that you intend to never let me down again 

It's clear to me and I can't ignore 
That I have to give you something I couldn't before

I didn't think that we would come to this 
 
Oh, no 
Your eyes, your face, your smile is what I miss 

Why'd you wait so long to take me back 

It's all a simple misunderstanding

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Any stories that I hear of you

Packing my bag and I'm playing my hand
He looks to me like the promised man
Got no time for poses set my explosives
I'm gunning for you I got power packed motives

[Chorus]",I Want You,1986
Debbie Harry,"Listen while I tell of a secret life
Clandestine lives entwined like vines
You may already know where when and how
If I tell you then, it's no secret now

Two sides to every story
Heads and tails of the very same coin
Two sides to every story

Different words with identical rhyme
They appear to be most commonplace
They're breathing like the winners of a marathon race
It's blase, causality
They are balanced like a trinity

Two sides to every story
Opposites from the ends of the earth
Two sides to every story
Who's to say what either is worth

We come together
Our story's told as one
We come together
After all is said and done

Listen while I tell of a secret life
Lives entwined like vines, man and wife
They said it's all express solidarity
When one's a crowd three's company

Two sides to every story
Heads and tails of the very same coin
Two sides to every story
Sill the same parallel lines",Secret Life,1986
Debbie Harry,"You, you got me in trouble
What you gonna do about it
You, you got me in trouble
What you gonna do, whoa
One end tired to your finger
For remembering
Who's the one who like to tease his kitten
At the other end of the string
But whatever it is
You got the biz
I can't reziz
You, you got me in trouble
What you gonna do about it
You, you got me in trouble
What you gonna do, whoa
Two lines out to the life boats

Your line's holding me
Can't ya see that I'm counting on you
While you're doing a number on me
Divided by three
You're the singular
Something I need

Spineless movement
And a wild attack

And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe too toe
Don't move to slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall

Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said don't stop, to punk rock

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

And now he only eats guitars, get up!",Rapture,1988

Attending to my needs

Work me now!
Work me now!

I'm still happy to know what it was like and I'll be thinking of you and asking myself everytime..

I'll build a shrine to what romance is
I'll wreck my brain for some kind of answers cause even though I'm in vain

Ive been doin some soul searchin
To find out where youre at
Ive been up and down the highway
In all kinds of foreign lands
Ive been all around the world
Marchin to the beat of a different drum
But just lately Ive realized
Baby the best is yet to come

Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
Someone like you keeps me satisfied
Someone exactly like you makes it all worthwhile
Someone like you keeps me satisfied

Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.

Now, hold on a minute before we go much further.

And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're making

And we, we got upsot.

And on my back I fell;

In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Five golden rings,
Four calling birds,
Three French Hens,
Two turtle doves

On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love sent to me:
Twelve drummers drumming,
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords a leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a milking,
Seven swans a swimming,
Six geese a laying,
Five golden rings,
Four calling birds,
Three French Hens,
Two turtle doves
And a Partridge in a pear tree.",The Twelve Days of Christmas,1992
Debbie Reynolds,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a Manger,1992

When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking.

Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all
 
And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Greatest Love of All,2009

You've got your family and they need you there

So I'm saving all my love for you

But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye

The sun has gone to bed and so must I

Debbie Turner,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965
Debbie Turner,"Let´s start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Let´s see if I can make it easy

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

So we put in words
One word for every note
Like this

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run

Ronda el olor a carne rota

Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now you've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home?
Finally a chance to say ""Hey, I love you""
Never again to be all alone

And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song

I can recall that somewhere someone said
If you don't succeed, try again

Using every ounce of strength that I have
Don't turn me away

'Cause I live and breathe you
God knows how much I need you
And I'll never leave you
God knows I love you

Too insecure is lovers who fail
The princess and the white knight
Live in fairy tales or so the story goes

We read so right from the very start
But here we are both with broken hearts
Let's not part this way

'Cause I live and breathe you
God knows how much I need you
And I'll never leave you

If I can't bring you back, maybe time can

Debby Boone,"I'd rather leave while I'm in love
While I still believe the meaning of the word
I keep my dreams and just pretend 
That you and I were never meant to end

To many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance of being hurt again
And you and I can't say goodbye
So if you look and find me gone 
Hey babe just carry on
You see I need my fantasy

Debby Boone,"When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.
 
My mama told me, ""Son,when rumors spread 
That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head.""
But I sure didn't listen to what she said;
Don't you know I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who lead you on and tell you lies, no, not my baby.
 
Tell me, baby, 
I don't believe what they're sayin', no.
Oh, no, not my baby.

Debby Boone,"When it's over
All over
There's really nothing more that's left to say
We both seem to know
What started out so right today could end up
As you go your separate ways

The laughter
The good times
All fade into a last and sad goodbye
And you and I
Too soon to really know all that we've lost now
Too late to even try
Now and then you still pretend
That love like this could never end

But it's over
All over
And it's like the morning sun has left the sky
And all that's left
Are long and lonely nights that seem forever
There's nothing left to say but goodbye

Debby Boone,"Are you here just to pass the time of day
Or is it love that brings you back my way
Did you miss me anytime we've been apart
Are you lookin' for a way back to my heart

Are you on the road to lovin' me again
Did the trail of yellow brick come to an end
Did you realize the future lies right here where you began
Are you on the road to lovin' me again

I don't need any promises and such
Only you and the way we used to touch

Debby Boone,"Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow
At least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

Oh I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always loose and you would win
At times you would desert me
The emptiness would hurt me
But you coming back was always worth the pain
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

I'd love to hear you tell me you don't need me anymore
Just like you used to tell me everyday
I loved to watch you leaving like a hundred times before
At least my eyes could see you walking in

Debby Boone,"They say that love is just a piece of cake
They tell me love is just a give and take
They make love sound like it comes easily
If its so easy why was it so hard for me

They say that love will sparkle in his eyes
They tell me loves not hard to recognize
They make love sound like its not hard to find
If its that easy what was it  made me so blind

If love is good
And love is great
Why don't they make a love 
Too good to brake 

My friends tell me that I will love again
But I am wiser now then I was then
I've seen how easy love
Can change its mind
Its just so easy that's why I'm so scared this time
Its just so easy that's why I'm so scared this time",If It's So Easy,1980
Debby Boone,"Sometimes I think I love you
Sometimes I just don't know
It feels so good when you hold me
But it hurts when you let go

I understand your feelings
But understand mine too
While your heart belongs to someone else
What is mine supposed to do

Woman its time you stopped your dreaming
All the lying and the scheming
That keep you warm at night
Woman there's no sense feeling bad
You can't loose what you never had
So dry your eyes and take it like a woman

I said in the beginning 
Wouldn't let it get this far
'Cause there's no chance in wining 
With things the way they are

But somewhere along the feelings
You became a part of me
And I can't share your love with someone else
Without it killing me

Debby Boone,"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean,
But you don't care how many tears I cry

I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything

Debelah Morgan,"[Chorus]
All I gotta do
Is think of you
That keeps me
From a feelin' blue
I think about you all the time
You really blow my mind
I'm so glad you're mine
Repeat chorus

Before I open my eyes
You're already on my mind
And when I think of you
Thoughts of you keep
Away the blues

[Chorus]

I dream of you at night
I can't sleep unless
You're on my mind
I never ever get the blues
Because of the love
I get from you

I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad you're mine

Debelah Morgan,"chorus)
What would you do if I stopped loving you
What would you say if I just walked away
I really gotta tell you baby
Last night it crossed my mind

(verse 1)
What would you do if you came home
And I packed up my clothes and left you
Took my love and left you all alone
Baby lately you've been treating me so mean and cold
That's not the way, not the way love goes

Tell me where's the love and tenderness
Where or where did it go
Don't you think that I won't leave you
I'll pack my love and go

Chorus

(verse 2)
If you think that just because I love you
I will stay and you can treat me any way
That you want to, 'cause last night
When you were fighting me I was thinking
How much better things used to be

Tell me where's the love and tenderness
Where or where did it go
Don't you think that I won't leave you
I'll pack my love and go

Brigde

Baby lately you've been treating me so mean and cold
We argue more than we've been making love baby
I don't wanna be taken for granted anymore
Last night had better be the last or I'm out that door

Hip-hop on and on and on and break mics constant

Masked avengers get smacked and injured
Strapped'll get cho' back with some black suspenders

Bass'll hit yo face quicker than a passion fruit

Big cheese inflict sick disease
Make hits that'll make thick chicks strip tease
Clicks freeze when the trigger click squeeze
Makin' people in the disco duck like Riq Jeeves

(Deborah Allen - Rafe VanHoy)

I don't know why all my friends try to hurt me
Telling me lies I know can't be true
Everyone knows seeing is believing
All I can see is me loving you
How can they say that you don't really love me
Who really knows what love is anyway
If I'm a fool then I'll stay in a fool's paradise

No one but me really knows how to love you
Nobody sees what I read between the lines
Nobody is here all alone in the darkness
And you hold me close and tell me that you're mine
Some of them call me a fool for believing
All those wonderful things that you say
As long as I can I will stay in a fool's paradise

Everybody tells me to open my eyes
Wake up and tell you goodbye
I'm so afraid if I did that I would find
I would wake up a fool of a different kind
So let them call me a fool for believing
All those wonderful things that you say
If I'm a fool then I'll stay in a fool's paradise

As long as I can I will stay in this fool's paradise

You only get around to me when someone else has said goodbye
Somehow you only want the ones who noly going to make you cry
It seems no matter what you do you never get their loving affection
It should be obvious to you you're looking in the wrong direction

What's the matter with me
What do I have to do to make you see
Just how good it could be
If it's really love that you need
What's the matter with me

When you're lying in my arms waiting for your heart to feel
How can you be so close to me and not know the way I feel
You say it makes you feel so good to know you can cry on my shoulder
I must really be a fool to let it happen over and over

Deborah Allen,"Hurt me
Why in the world did you hurt me?
And just when I thought
I'd found someone to trust
You took away your love and

Hurt me
I still can't believe you hurt me
And just when I thought it was safe to come in
You let me want you and need you and then

You left me, like a child in the rain
Now, I'm mending myself in the pain
Oh, you hurt me

Yes, you left me
Like a child in the rain
Now, I'm lost in an ocean of pain

Oh, you hurt me

Can't you imagine how I'm feeling now?
Oh, will you ever know how?

If I'm not the one you'll always want

I was attracted to your flame

Made up my mind
Till you start comin' back around

I'm not a toy you can play with at will
Then throw me away once you get your thrill
You better watch yourself, the things that you do

So I can make it until the morning's light
Cheat the night

You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer, would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I tried to forget but what else can I do?

I know if I lose you, not a dream will I have left

For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",French Medley: Mon Homme (My Man)/Ne Me Quittes Pas (If You Go Away),2004
Deborah Boily,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You/Where Do You Start,2004
Deborah Boily,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You for the Music,2004

It seems a miracle that I'm still sitting here
Staring at these parallel lines

Stretching out and going somewhere
I got a jar of shells by my bedside
I got a silver train running outside
I got a heart running wild, running wild

Love is such a temporary thing
It comes and goes a thousands times a day
No hard feelings in the songs I sing
Just another town to blow my heart away

I got a yellow rose from my garden
And a faded photo of my father
He's still keeping one eye on the weather
I got a heart running wild, running wild

Make believe you're somewhere else
It's a game I've learned to play a lot lately
Driving round here by myself
With the dog palms and the sunsets and the sea

I got a jar of shells by my bedside
I got a silver train running outside
I got a bird that sings in the morning
Shadows on the floor slowly shifting

I got a box of paints but the lid's gone
I got a string of pearls from my last song
I got a heart running wild",Last to Know,1991
Deborah Conway,"Ever since I saw you
I can't close my eyes
Without your face appearing there
And that scares me

All the best intentions
Still I'm led astray
Even though I know it's wrong
I can't stay away

You're under my skin
Now you're under my skin
You found the way to get in
I know

I tried to walk away
How'm I s'posed to live without you
Baby when you're under my skin
Your under my skin

You could snap your fingers
I could kick myself
'Cause every time you call my name
I would follow

You'd think I'd know better
Not at all like me
Sitting here just wishing

I had the nerve to say
You're under my skin
Now you're under my skin
You found the way to get in

I know
I tried to walk away
How'm I s'posed to live without you

Deborah Conway,"Deborah Conway and Dorland Bray
You weren't the first to send me red roses
And you weren't the first to give me away
I'm not the only one to have my fingers burnt
But that was a one-way conversation and you got the final word
Forget-me-nots forgotten
White roses
Regrets and promises collide
I'm still flying the flag for you
Blue heart red eyes and white roses

It's true
Lovers swap red roses but white ones from you
Spell the end of everything fine
Yellow roses are for jealously but you
Don't send me them
You send the ones that say we're through
You weren't to know that something was making me blue
Keeping all the sunshine away
You said forever and I took you at your word
White roses make a lie of everything I've heard",White Roses,1991
Deborah Conway,"Will you miss me when you're sober
Will you remember me when you're not overcome
With bloodshot eyes and breath stinking of rum
Will you give me a thought
Well I was taught
The hard way not fal for drunks like you
Experience has torn my brain in two
And I don't think so clearly now
But I wonder how
I let you get away with murder all the time
It must have been some crazy state of mind
But I want you to know that I'm all better now
'Cause you've been caught

Red handed stuck inside the honey pot
Your fly's undone but you still don't know what's what
But reassured I'm gonna let you know
'Cause I got to go
And I'm taking the bar with me when I leave
It's a sure way to guarantee you'll grieve
If only for a day
You might even find out that
You will miss me when you're sober
You might remember me when you're not overcome
With your whiskey tears and feeling close to numb
That you'll give me a thought",Will You Miss Me When You're Sober,1991

Way above
The clouds are black
They say it's gonna pour but I haven't been keeping track
So now we're here
In this cage
The Ferris wheel of love, my love what a charade
It's been a long time since anyone meant what they said
One step forward
Two steps backward
I won't wrestle, you won't talk back
Three deep breaths I'm still alive and brilliant

Turn around
And be polite
I'm so sick of I listening to your crap about the breasts you like
Look at me
I am restrained
I'm not screaming like some jealous adolescent here in vain
So you got me
On this ride
What was it darling what exactly did you have in mind
Ferris wheel
Up and down
Is this some dumb metaphor to tell me you're not hanging round",Alive & Brilliant,1994
Deborah Conway,"I slid right into your hands
And you grabbed me and told me how you'd understand
Whatever I wanted to be
And I believed for a while you believing in me
I'm turning circles again
Caught in a spin
I'm a high fly trapeze
To you little worm
Earthbound and dirty and still on your knees
Release me
You know I want to come down
The air is too thin off the ground
And my head's not clear
Way up here
You brought me what money can buy
But I don't want the world I just want your time
Now you want me to drink from your cup
But baby it's too late to kiss and make up
I'm turning circles again
Caught in a spin

To you little worm
Earthbound and dirty and still on your knees
Release me
You know I want to come down
The air is too thin off the ground
And my head's not clear
Way up here
Release me
You and I are going nowhere
You stopped pretending to care
Quite sometime ago
And you've let it show
Maybe you think I'm unfair
But if you were in my shoes and your soul was bare
Would the honey still drip from your tongue
Would you still lie with ease if your jury was hung",Release Me,1998
Deborah Conway,"I like the way that you took advantage
Stayed at my party 'til everyone went home
A perfect stranger
Need a place to lay your hat
The lone ranger couldn't saddle me with that
But you were right on track
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel like making daisy chains
And playing hide'n' seek
When it's only the beginning
The fairy dust is still in flight
And this could be the love of a lifetime even if it lasts a week
Or maybe just a daydream
When we go walking along the river
Watch the old men fishing the sunny side of the pier
It's like a movie and you're my leading man
The way you woo me just like Cary Grant
You want to hold my hand
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel like breaking window panes all up and down my street
When it's only the beginning
We can bring the house down every night
And this could be the love of a lifetime even if it lasts a week
Or just the sweetest daydream
And do you ever feel the passion
To jump from a speeding train
I'd like to be the wheels beneath you
I'd like to be the rain
That could wash away your pain
It's only
So hold me closer
Let me feel you sigh
My Spanish butterfly
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind

Deborah Conway,"It was clear
It was bright
It was a shinning star on a black, black night
It was pure
It was plain
It was a weird, wild party and nobody came
It was my blood
It was your sweat
It was a waterfall of tears where no one gets wet
It isn't in the news
Or any magazine
It won't turn a profit
Or make your toilet clean
It's not something you can see
Or something you can buy
It's very nice to swallow
When all you're feed are lies
What is this stuff?
This gourmet stuff
This powerful, magical, illicit stuff
It's the truth
Maybe if we told it to our children
They could tell theirs",DCN #348,1999

You never knew how much you hurt me, baby
You never cared how much I cried

And you're never gonna break my heart again

So you can tell me one more lie 
But I ain't hearin' you baby 
'Cause you caused me pain 
This time you've gone too far 
And now you lost it all in vain 

You say you love me but I find it hard to believe 
It didn't take that long for you to get over me 
Now after all this time you're trying to get back with me

It seems like yesterday 
It felt so good to be in love but our age got in the way 
I still feel the warmth of your arms 
I feel you on my face when I reminisce 
I think of this 'cause what I miss is you.
 
We all have memories we should not forget 
times that become part of our life 
A person so heart-felt 
When I think of you instantly I get sentimental thoughts
I get sentimental 
wonderful that's what you are unforgettable
You know my heart won't let me go.
Love-able 
So love-able
I get emotional when I think of your love
 
Sentimental thoughts of moments 
Captured in our minds as we grow up
Things in life do change for us, but
Memories stay the same.
Loved ones in our lives are important
Never take for granted someone
Spend some time while they're around.
 
We all have memories we should not forget 
times that become part of our life 
A person so heart-felt 
When I think of you instantly I get sentimental thoughts
I get sentimental

You know my heart won't let me go.

Deborah Cox,"Last night I slept alone, I stayed at home 
For the first time since you've been gone, babe 
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand 
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known 

How you walk away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me 
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy 

But you went away, baby, and It's such a shame 
How could you turn you back on me, oh

[Chorus:]
If you really don't want me, if you don't want me 
If you really don't need me, if you don't need me, 
If you really don't love me, tell me who do you love? 

If you really don't want me, if you don't want me 
If you really don't need me, if you don't need me 
If you really don't love me, then who do you love? 

I gave you babe everything, a man could ever need, 
I was there whenever you would call, baby, 
But somehow your feelings changed, and you don't act the same 
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all 

How you walk away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me 
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy 

Now the love is gone, babe 
Tell me what went wrong 
How could you leave me hanging on, oh baby 

[Chorus]

I once was blind, but baby, now I'm seeing 
That I'm not the one, who can fill your every need 
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality 
Now I know, yes, I know that, you're not the one for me 
Ohhhhh, baby... 

[Chorus]

How you walk away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me 
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy

Been so long since you've been gone 
The greatest thing I've ever known

Deborah Cox,"There were words between us
Words that hurt inside
Still that's just no reason 
To say the words goodbye

We can't let go of something beautiful
We can't just let it die
Can't you and I just
Try to find one reason 
To just give us one more try

Couldn't love heal the pain
Couldn't time take the tears away
Couldn't you, you and me
Try again
Couldn't we
Couldn't you, couldn't me, couldn't we
Couldn't we

Start this story over
Turn the page tonight
Nothin' wrong between us
That love could not make right
Can't we forgive and let our hearts forget
Let the love back inside
Can't you and I just
Get back to those feelings
And feel them just one more time

Couldn't love heal the pain
Couldn't time take the tears away
Couldn't you, you and me 
Try again 
Couldn' you, couldn't me, couldn't we

Couldn't we
Turn back the hands of time
To a time when our love was alright
To those nights when the touch was sweet
Can we find our way back 
Before we lose everything

Couldn't love heal the pain
Couldn't time take the tears away
Couldn't you, you an me try again, again

Couldn't we stay together
Couldn't we make it better
Couldn't we turn the page 
And start the story over
Couldn't we bring the love back
Couldn't we take one more chance
Couldn't we hold each other 
Just a little closer

Deborah Cox,"It was a cold day in December 
I remember it so well 
You captured my whole being 
And you left me in a spell 

You warmed my heart with passion 
Desiring all of you 
You left me cold in the summer 
I wish that I only knew but- 
 
I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

All the nights you left me crying 
Keeping company with my fears 
That some day you'd leave me lonely 
And that's exactly what you did 
I swore that I was your baby 
The darkest night for you I'd bear 
Now that I need you here with me 
I call your name and you're not there 

You left me standing 
So empty-handed 
Out in the cold 
How was I to know 
That my love didn't matter 
And my world was shattered 
'Cause you left me here 
Drowning in tears, oh why? 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

After we made plans to spend our lives together 
I thought what we had was meant to be forever 
Oh why did our love have to go away? 
I don't know how, I don't know when 
But I know, I'll never love this way again 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away

Tryin' to forget about
Ordinary thangs
Typical predictable
Baby I knew the end before we started
You had me feelin' like I owe you somethin'
Cause you were there in times when I had nothin'
But you threw it all away
With the shady things you do

So forgive me
For what I'm bout to say
And what I'm bout to do 
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love for you

You been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you been chasin' every girl in sight
And you been messin' around and lyin' down 
It's over now X 2

I ignored my intuition
And passed it off as a suspicion
But you were just so bold
You kept puttin' in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me

So baby please forgive me
For what I'm bout to do
And what I'm bout to say
I can't take no more

But you didn't appreciate my love
Instead you kept lookin' for the one

When all the while what your were searching for
Was in front of your face
Just forget it 
You'll regret it
It's really over now
Just turn around

You walked in and said you're leaving me
Good bye, good bye
I don't know why I never woke up
Torch of your love
You'd given me had died
So I erased you from my mind, but I see

Just when I think I'm over you
I feel your body cry
Making love to you
Just when I think I'm over you
I hear a song that plays
That we once danced to

The way you would hurt
The way that'd say good bye, good bye
And all the lies, they did you no good
You'd live with yourself I hated you inside
'Cause you were over me

I see you
Just when I thought that we're done

When you were there I didn't realize
All the things you meant to me
Till you were gone
And now you're just a memory

Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turned around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

Then fall again when will I ever learn

This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings

Spotted a couple 
Who wasn't in trouble 
And they were doin' no harm

To give her love back he rubs her hips 
Oh, I could feel it 
I felt their passion 
Running through my warming veins

Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you don't love me?

All that I know

I'll never ever find another love like you, oh no

I love you too much baby

I love you much oh

We can't be friends, I'm still in love

With you

With you

I am

Still in love

Still in love

You didn't have to leave

Deborah Cox,"Baby it's over

Tryin' to forget about
Ordinary thangs
Typical predictable
Baby I knew the end before we started
You had me feelin' like I owe you somethin'
Cause you were there in times when I had nothin'
But you threw it all away
With the shady things you do

So forgive me
For what I'm bout to say
And what I'm bout to do 
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love for you

You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you been chasin' every girl in sight
And you been messin' around and lyin' down 
It's over now X 2

I ignored my intuition
And passed it off as a suspicion
But you were just so bold
You kept puttin' in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me

So baby please forgive me
For what I'm bout to do
And what I'm bout to say
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love 
 
You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you been chasin' every girl in sight
And you been messin' around and lyin' down
It's over now X 2

When you were down I helped to pick you up
But you didn't appreciate my love
Instead you kept lookin' for the one
Hopin' love could take my place
When all the while what your were searching for
Was in front of your face
Just forget it 
You'll regret it
It's really over now
Just turn around
Don't watch me walk along

I ain't down no no no more
You been messin'

You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You bee creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night 
And you been chasin' every girl in sight
And you been messin' around and lyin' down

Deborah Cox,"Do you believe in the healing power of love, or is it just a fantasy?
Do you believe in the power from above? I feel it between you and me.
And I don`t have to look in your eyes to know
There`s something going on here that`s out of our control

This is happening too fast for us to fight.
There`s a healing power (healing power) deep in all of us.
In the darkest hour (darkest hour) we can still rise up (still rise up).
There`s a new horizon shining between you and me.

When you slip your hand in mine, I feel the rub of the healing power of love.
(healing power)
And we got nothing but love to pull us through,
Love and compassion (ooh, love and compassion),

But in this desperation world nothing else will do.
Oh, we can make it happen (only we can make it happen).
And you don`t have to say a word, I understand (I am yours only).
When you lay down, your love lasts forever (waiting forever).

You will always be my woman, and I will be your man.
There`s a healing power (healing power) deep in all of us.
In the darkest hour (darkest hour) we can still rise up (still rise up).
There`s a new horizon shining between you and me.

When you slip your hand in mine, I feel the rush of the healing power of love.
Deep in the night, when we`re so alone, I swear I feel the power that`s
Greater than our own.
And how a love unfolds as we tumble through the darkness to the great unknown.

There`s a healing power (there`s a healing power) deep in all of us.

Deborah Cox,"I've spent all my life, on a search to find 
The love who'll stay for eternity 
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs 
But when I turn around 
Again, love has knocked me down 
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad 
I'm sad to say, love wins again 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

[Chorus:]
How did you get here? 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
I've tried that love thing for the last time 
My heart says no, no! 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
But you came along and changed my mind 

This time I swear I'm through 
But if only you knew 
How many times I've said those words 
Then fall again, when will I ever learn 
Knowing these tears I cry 
This lovely black butterfly 
Must take a chance, and spread my wings 
Love can make you do some crazy things 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

No, nobody, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh! 

No, no, no...

It's easy to believe when sorrow never comes your way
And when I try to pray, it seems the words they come out wrong

So everything that matters to me
I give it all to you
'cause I'm tired of the way the crying feels
And just to let you know I have been hurt so many times
So I pray to God that this time loves for real

I believe in you 'cause you believe you believe in me
And even when the night makes the light hard to see

I can't lie and say I
Always smile but I try
The tears sometimes they come
And nothing people say can ease the pain
Oh but when I close my eyes I see you reaching out for me
You tell me that this test I'm in, it won't last always

And though the seasons may change
Still your love it remains
When this world soon shall pass

Cause I already know what you're thinking, yeah
Things just got more complicated
But we can't fake it
This is real, so let's just go with it

[Chorus]
We became more than just friends
Where do we go from here
After the morning after
I let you in
What's the next move to make
The morning after

Hush, don't say a word
I can't even explain what I'm feeling
Feeling, lying next to you
Ooh feels so good
Don't let the words ruin the moment
Please don't say nothing
I know you might feel guilty babe
Don't let the mind do the speaking
Just let the heart do the leading
Cause we gave each other what we both wanted
Look what we've started

[Chorus]
Baby I can't help but see it
You gave me what I needed
There's no way that I can deny
I love you so
The longer that I'm with you
The more I see that I need you
Let's take what we have and make it last
Forever more

Deborah Cox,"Each night you held me in your arms 
Still you never did keep me warm 
Conversation was a waste of time 
Never even asked what was on my mind (oh) 
It's funny how I can't recall your touch 
Spending time alone with you is never enough 
This emptiness I feel is too much 
You may not understand there's been a change of plans 

[Chorus:]
Mr. Lonely, you gotta go 
You need to pack your bags and be out the door 
Even though you were there for me 
You never cared for me 
Before I couldn't see but now I know 
Mr. Lonely, I'm in love 
I've found a real man and you need to know 
And this time you won't be coming back 
'Cause his love will last 
Mr. Lonely, who's lonely now? 

Two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon 
Same place, same park, but where were you 
I waited, but you never came 
That's when he sat down, but it wasn't the same 
Every word I said, he listened to 
Everything he had, I was missin' in you 
He's the man I never had before 
I won't be needin' you no more 

(Chorus)
 
The silence was killin' me 
It almost got the best of me 
Now that I've got room to breathe 
I'm makin' some changes, changes 
I'm stronger now; I'm wiser now 
A real man wants to hold me now 
It's clear to see I'll never be Mrs. Lonely 

If you think you're lonely now 
Wait until tonight babe 
If you think you're lonely now 
Wait until tonight babe

Boy you really blow my mind (oh my gosh)
I'm just lookin' at you like (oh my gosh)
You really got the vibe I like (oh my gosh)
The way you comin' at me like (oh my gosh)
So what you tryin' to do tonight (oh my gosh)
I'll just roll with you tonight (oh my gosh)

'Cause the way you talkin' to me
'Bout the way you want to move me
And the way you puttin' to me is like (oh my gosh)
The way that you came up into the spot
Caught my eyes right from the beginning
And before you even said two words to me
I knew that with you I'd be winnin'
I never been around somebody like you before
And no that ain't no lie
Let me get my coat and we can hit the door
And you can take me for a ride

[Chorus]

Now I don't usually fall head over heals
For a cat that I just met
But cha talk like a baller that bigger than life
So I figured I'd take a chance (you make me wanna)
Ride with cha, slide with cha
Drive with cha on the freeway so take it easy
We can rock it all night long
As long as you want to stay with me baby

[Chorus]

(it's all right; it's just midnight)
So don't you worry 'bout the time just get into it, into it

So don't you stop it, don't you stop whatcha doin'",Oh My Gosh,2002
Deborah Cox,"[Chorus:]
Can you pretend to be the man I should have been with
Can we fake the life you know I should have had
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care
Or I'll have to give the part to someone else

You seem to have an important part
The lead role of my heart
You played it well along time ago
Until I started falling in love
And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you play his part at this time

[Chorus]

Love is like a see saw it takes two in order for it to work
I'm working hard, I'm playing my part but the scene still won't work
And rehearsals are long because your timing is all wrong
So I'll find someone who loves me
And who can play your part for life

I deserve a lot better than this
And I'm tired of acting like it's okay for me to give you my love
And receive nothing back in return

[Chorus]",Play Your Part,2002
Deborah Cox,"Look at you
Different day but same damn bags
You're on my porch
And I don't even have to ask
I see tears in your eyes
As you come inside and breakdown
So what's he done
And I hope this don't take long
Cause you know one call from him
And you'll be home before morn
Here's a friendly hug
Followed by tough love
Are you ready?

[Chorus:]
He's only gonna treat you
The way he knows he can
It's all up to you my sista to show him that he can't
Have you had enough
'Cause it's been long enough
Time for a change
Starting with you
No, don't say a word
Listen to Deborah for once
'Cause I went through the same thing
So I'll tell you what needs to be done
Mavis said it best
Girl respect yourself
It starts with you
You want him to be a better man
And you want him to treat you better than you treat yourself,
Girl you can help by showing him how he can
You can start by building your self esteem
Start believing you can do anything
And you'll find your man will fall in line
And if he don't than leave him behind

But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turned around 
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken 
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again
So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're staying here

How did you get in
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here, (nobody's supposed to be here)
But you came along and changed my mind

This time I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again when will I ever learn
Knowing these tears I've cried
This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things
So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here
Standing here

Shoo do doop
Nobody's supposed to be here
Nobody
No no no no 
No no no no

How did you get in
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and you changed my mind",Intro,2003
Deborah Cox,"Try to forget about it
Ordinary things...typical predictable
Baby I knew the end before it started
You got me feelin' like I owed you something
'Cause you were there at times when I had nothing
But you threw it all away
With the shady things you do

Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say
And what I'm about to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love for you

You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' round and lyin' down
It's over now

You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' round and lyin' down
It's over now

I ignore my intuition
And pass it off as a suspicion
But you were just so bold
You kept puttin' it in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me

Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say
And what I'm about to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love for you

You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' round and lyin' down
It's over now

When you were down I helped to pick you up
Instead you kept lookin' for the one
When all the while what you were searching for
Was in front of your face

Just forget it... you'll regret it
It's really over now
Just turn around and watch me walk
I'm gone",It's Over Now [Hex's Retro-Future Mix],2003
Deborah Cox,"Each night you held me in your arms 
Still you never did keep me warm 
Conversation was a waste of time 
Never even asked what was on my mind (oh) 

It's funny how I can't recall your touch 
Spending time alone with you is never enough 
This emptiness I feel is too much 
You may not understand there's been a change of plans 

[Chorus]
Mr. Lonely, you gotta go 
You need to pack your bags and be out the door 
Even though you were there for me 
You never cared for me 
Before I couldn't see but now I know 
Mr. Lonely, I'm in love 
I've found a real man and you need to know 
And this time you won't be coming back 
'Cause his love will last 
Mr. Lonely, who's lonely now? 

Two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon 
Same place, same park, but where were you 
I waited, but you never came 
That's when he sat down, but it wasn't the same 

Every word I said, he listened to 
Everything he had, I was missin' in you 
He's the man I never had before 
I won't be needin' you no more 

[Chorus]

The silence was killin' me 
It almost got the best of me 
Now that I've got room to breathe 
I'm makin' some changes, changes 
I'm stronger now; I'm wiser now 
A real man wants to hold me now 
It's clear to see I'll never be Mrs. Lonely 

If you think you're lonely now 
Wait until tomorrow babe 
If you think you're lonely now 
Wait until tomorrow babe

Can you pretend to be the man I should have been with?
Can we fake the life you know I should have had?
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care?
Or I´ll have to give the part to someone else?

You seem to have an important part
The lead role of my heart
You played it well along time ago
Until I started falling in love

And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you play his part at this time

[Chorus]

Love is like a see saw
It takes two in order for it to work
I´m working hard, I´m playing my part 
But the scene still won´t work
And rehearsals are long 
Because your timing is all wrong
So I´ll find someone who loves me
Who can play your part this time

for me to give you my love
And receive nothing back in return

Different day but same damn bags
You're on my porch
And I don't even have to ask

I see tears in your eyes
As you come inside and breakdown
So what's he done
And I hope this don't take long

'Cause you know one call from him
And you'll be home before morn
Here's a friendly hug
Followed by tough love
Are you ready?

[Chorus]
He's only gonna treat you
The way he knows he can
It's all up to you my sista to show him that he can't
Have you had enough
'Cause it's been long enough
Time for a change
Starting with you

No, don't say a word
Listen to Deborah for once
'Cause I went through the same thing
So I'll tell you what needs to be done

Mavis said it best
Girl respect yourself
It starts with you
You want him to be a better man

And you want him to treat you better than you treat yourself,
Girl you can help by showing him how he can
You can start by building your self esteem
Start believing you can do anything

And you'll find your man will fall in line
And if he don't than leave him behind

Deborah Cox,"It was a cold day in December 
I remember it so well 
You captured my whole being 
And you left me in a spell 

You warmed my heart with passion 
Desiring all of you 
You left me cold in the summer 
I wish that I only knew but- 
 
I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

All the nights you left me crying 
Keeping company with my fears 
That some day you'd leave me lonely 
And that's exactly what you did 
I swore that I was your baby 
The darkest night for you I'd bear 
Now that I need you here with me 
I call your name and you're not there 

You left me standing 
So empty-handed 
Out in the cold 
How was I to know 
That my love didn't matter 
And my world was shattered 
'Cause you left me here 
Drowning in tears, oh why? 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

After we made plans to spend our lives together 
I thought what we had was meant to be forever 
Oh why did our love have to go away? 
I don't know how, I don't know when 
But I know, I'll never love this way again 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why

Comme aux premières rencontres
On finira seul au poste de lui

The creator of the planet Earth
And the father of civilization
The god of the Universe

Allah is the one
Never gonna find
Another like that nowhere

Word

J'sais qui va are'tentir avant d'repentir lors do dernier round
Un sac de croix sur l'dos j'affronte
Ces foudres prêt à en découdre
Tout blanc vêtu, moi le sale noir, l'esprit nue
Seul sur le ring sous le sol spacial, entends la cloche fatale
Quand les anges ont la dale, see'est mieux qu'un blanc qui sale

Ca fait un bail que j'danse avec l'espoir
Faut que j'sorte do bétail où j'traine ma vie animale
Outre les raisons, seul dans les choix et actions
Et trop de souvenirs en tête, est-je pris les bonnes décisions?
See'est dans la pulsion souvent qu'jai choisi la friction

Mais bon Franchement ya des cons sur
Terre qui méritent sanction
Et tout ce que j'aurais pu dire et faire, ouais je sais j'espère
Veinement qu'les impairs why'a que moi qui va devoir les payer

Et j'ai bien essayer, tu peux me rayer d'ta liste si ça t'plais
Et si tu laisses en fait les mêmes parfaits
Ton peuple il va faire les jetés
Ni l'moins bon, ni l'meilleur vécu à cent à l'heure
La peur sur le front

Le coeur qui fait front comme mon père le fit
L'Nez collé à l'envie, j'ai fais ce qui fallait
J'te le dis en face, see'était ca ou m'affolé

On peut pas toute sa vie cavaler au campement
Rémy désolé, je suis see'que j'ai fais
Et si see'est pas see'qui fallait
Seigneur fallait pas m'provoquer

Hey hey, seul face à lui
Dans la vie à la mort, on s'donne
Pas de fausses tonnes
Tout s'échelonne pour finir quand l'heure sonne
La grâce reste le prêt, see'est pas le souci dans la zone

Je sais d'où vienne mes chromosomes
Devant la question éternelle d'lhomme Qui nous sommes?
Dis leur qu'on est le peuple d'celui qui a croqué la pomme
On finira par un décompte
Au delà d'l'univers et ca le monde le sait
Là où la vie est cadenassée, Père

On sera seul face à lui
You can't escape fate
Allah be the maker
Bow down to your creator

Tout seul face à lui
Put your wicked heart on the scale
You melt like a snow flake in hell

Seul face à lui
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No disgiue, no alibis and no lies
Tout seul face à lui
You realize every breath you took
It came from the most High

Ma première clope, j'lai fumé en traitre
D'une traite, dans une punèbre
J'ai même pas aimé, quelle merde
Pourquoi j'lai fais? je l'ignore

Faut qu'ca serve comme être célèbre
Putain, tu crois pas que see'tait mieux être bon élève?
Avec une crève deux ans dans les dortoirs
Premier coeur j'crèvre

Histoire comme les autres, brève
Debout dans les piqués de grève
À cette époque ma mère vit ses rêves
Le syndicat est puissant et à la une des prèves
Et après quoi? Ils se sont tous taillés comme des lâches
Se sont couvert de la misère dans les flashs

Maman are'viens sur Terre
Ici merde see'est chacun sa ganache
Excuses moi pour ma scolarité à l'arrache
Accroches mon coeur dans l'cadre
Et mon are'gard sévère s'évade

Comme Jules se tire dans le back dans monade et sérade
La vie see'est grave me laisse indifférent, maintenant cest grave
Dans un arbre prosse l'ail nos initiales s'gravent
Mes amours, see'est ma main que j'tends
Attrapez la sans dire non, on perd déjà trop d'temps

On joue tous les mêmes scènes, les mêmes peines
Restez fort quand les difficultés d'te voir caller
Crie ou implore
See'est comme un implant qui tient l'bon chemin de haut
Alors que rien se tient, seul l'instein pousse nos limites

Excuse, why'en a pas mal qui imite
Chacun son sort, chacun ses rites
Chacun sa cause, fuck les antisémites
Je dois rien à personne à part au Seigneur
Et see'qu'il emporte, faut l'gérer

Chaque cellule grise part pas
Mais pour être jugé dans c'monde
Pourtant j'rêve de liberté dans c'monde
Ceux qui dirigent, see'est la minorité
Les femmes qui aiment faire ce spécial
Pour les deux pour, crient trop
Là-bas why'aura pas d'blancs ni d'negros
You know?

[Unverified]

On se trouvera seul face à lui
The lie shatter
No computer data
Only truth matter

Tout seul face à lui
Every step you take
Every breath you take
Every move you make

Seul face à lui
You can't escape fate
Allah be the maker
Bow down to your creator

Tout seul face à l'unique
Tout seul you IAM

Who put the sun in the sky?
Who causes the birds to fly?
Who put the light in the eyes?
Who's the answer to why?

Every step you take, every breath you take
Every move you make, the most High create
No computer data, the lie shatter, only truth matter

But you came along and changed my mind 
How did you get here? 

Nobody's supposed to be here 
I've tried that love thing for the last time 
My heart says no, no!

But you came along and changed my mind",Nobody's Supposed to Be Here [Special-Slow to Fast-Version],2004
Deborah Cox,"I can't believe that a year has passed 
It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory 

[Chorus]
The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September

Deborah Cox,"Come with me [Repeat: x 2]

We had a life, we had a love
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it
Well that was then, and this is now
And I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry,oh yes I'm sorry

How could something so good go so bad?
How could something so right go so wrong?
I don't know,I don't have all the answers but I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry,oh yes I'm sorry

[Chorus: x 2]
You can run and you can hide
(But I'm not leaving unless you come with me)
We got our problems but im on you're side
(You're all I need please believe in me)

I only wanted you as someone to love
But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go
And I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry,oh yes I'm sorry
Oh you can run!

[Chorus: x 2]

You can run and you can hide...

Deborah Cox,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

Deborah Cox,"I walk through these halls but nothing feels the same
Where we once made our lives, it's now so empty
The same paint is on the walls
The same songs, I use to sing alone
We'd run through the night but now it's so cold (so cold)

Oh, this house is not a home
'Cause love don't live here anymore (since you been gone)
I never felt this all alone since you went away
'Cause this house is not a home (love don't live here)
Why don't it feel like it felt before?
I know you're never coming back
This time is it over? (over)

I look in the mirror and you're still standing there
It's just an illusion of what use to be
So I lay in the bed we shared
Where we made love a million times I swear
Can't face the truth that you moved on, you're gone

Oh, this house is not a home
'Cause love don't live here anymore (since you been gone)

In these rooms we were together
But now were so far apart
We should of tried to make it better
But then you went and left and torn up my heart

(Since you been gone)
(It's so lonely)
(When you coming home?)
(Love don't live here)

Since you went away baby why didn't you stay?
I'm alone now, it's so lonely baby

It's not the same
