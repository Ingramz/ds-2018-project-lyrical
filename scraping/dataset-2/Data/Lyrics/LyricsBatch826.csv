Paul Pierce,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,2001
Paul Pierce,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,2001
Paul Plishka,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1995

Paul Ponnudorai,"I'm 500 miles away from home
Teardrops fell on momma's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm 500 miles away from home

[SPOKEN:] I know this is the same road I took the day I left home,
        but it sure looks different now. And I guess I look 
        different too, cause time changes everything. I wonder what
        they'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad.

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still 500 miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Oh I'm still 500 miles away from home",Five Hundred Miles,2005
Paul Ponnudorai,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 
With his song",Killing Me Softly,2005
Paul Ponnudorai,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2005
Paul Porter,"Somebody's got it down in they hands
but I can fell it all over me
I got it and I can fell it all over me
Somebody's got it down in they feet but I can feel it all over me
I got it and I can feel it all over me

There was a time in my life when my heart wasn't right
I had no peace and I had no joy so I decided to call on the Lord
He washed me y'all in His precious blood
Filled me with His spirit and His love
And since that day I know I been changed
Now I'm walking in Jesus name

Nobody but Jesus Christ can take my wrong and make it right
See I'm bound in sin but now I'm free 
Been born again I got the victory
The things I use to do I don't do no more
Places I use to go I don't go no more
My heart is fixed my minds made up
I'm living for Jesus until He comes",I've Got It,2005

Che hai acceso

Hai incontrato per strada

When I'm alone I dream of the horizon and words fail me.
There is no light in a room where there is no sun
and there is no sun if you're not here with me, with me.
From every window unfurls my heart the heart that you have won.
Into me you've poured the light,
the light that you found by the side of the road.

Time to say goodbye.
Places that I've never seen or experienced with you.
Now I shall, I'll sail with you upon ships across the seas,
seas that exist no more,
it's time to say goodbye.

When you're far away I dream of the horizon and words fail me.
And of course I know that you're with me, with me.
You, my moon, you are with me.

Paul Potts,"Qui dove il mare luccica
e tira forte il vento
sulla vecchia terrazza
davanti al golfo di Surriento
un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
dopo che aveva pianto
poi si schiarisce la voce
e ricomincia il canto

Te vojo bene assai
ma tanto tanto bene sai
e' una catena ormai
che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
penso alle notti la in America
ma erano solo le lampare
e la bianca scia di un'elica
senti il dolore nella musica
e si alzo dal pianoforte
ma quando vide uscire
la luna da una nuvola
gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte
guardo negli occhi la ragazza
quegli occhi verdi come il mare
poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
e lui credette di affogare

Potenza della lirica
dove ogni dramma e un falso
che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica
puoi diventare un altro
ma due occhi che ti quardano
cosi vicini e veri
ti fan scordare le parole
confondono i pensierei
cos diventa tutto piccolo
anche le notti la in America
ti volti e vedi la tua vita
dietro la scia di un'elica
ma si, e la vita che finisce
e non ce penso poi tanto
anzi, si sentiva gia felice
e ricomincio il suo canto

Te vojo bene assai
ma tanto tanto bene sai
e una catena ormai
che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

ENGLISH TRANSLATION

Here, where the sea shines
And the wind howls
On the old terrace
Beside the gulf of Sorrento
A man embraces a girl
After the tears
Then clears his throat
And continues the song:

I love you very much
Very, very much you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins
You know

He saw the lights out on the sea
Thought of the nights there in America
But they were only the fisherman's lamps
And the white wash astern
He felt the pain in the music
And stood up from the piano
But when he saw the moon
Emerging from a cloud
Death also seemed sweeter to him
He looked the girl in the eyes
Those eyes as green as the sea
Then suddenly a tear fell
And he believed he was drowning

I love you very much
Very, very much, you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins
You know

The power of opera
Where every drama is a hoax
With a little make-up and with mine
You can become someone else
But two eyes that look at you
So close and real
Make you forget the words
Confuse your thoughts
So everything becomes small
Also the nights there in America
You turn and see your life
Through the white wash astern
But, yes, it is life that ends
And he did not think much about it
On the contrary, he already felt happy
And continued his song

I love you very much
Very, very much, you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins
You know",Caruso,2007
Paul Potts,"He was beautiful,
Beautiful to my eyes.
From the moment I saw him,
The sun filled the sky.

He was so so beautiful,
Beautiful just to hold.
In my dreams he was spring time
Winter was cold.

How could I tell him
What I so clearly could see
Though I longed for him
I never trusted me completely
So I never could be free.

Oh, but it was beautiful
Knowing now that he cared
I will always remember
Moments that we shared

Now it's all over
Still the feelings linger on
For my dream keeps returning
Now that he's gone.

For it was beautiful, beautiful,
Beautiful to be loved",Cavatina,2007
Paul Potts,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly posses you
Open up your mind,
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night,2007
Paul Potts,"Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo giusto,
Li tutti vivono in pace e in onestà.
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere,

Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo chiaro,

Mi chiedono

Se tu ci sei per me forse quelche giorno poi
Il mondo capirá che non molto capitar
E tu ci sei per me, senti cosa diocono
Si, tu ci sei per me

Ora che sei con me vicino a me stringimi

Dimmi quanto tempo ancora resterai con me
Dimmi quante cosi nascondi dentro te

I would tingle with a single glance in your eye,

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Paul Quinichette,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

And dream I'm dreamin'

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

Paul Renz,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

Paul Reubens,"Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
I wanna do it
Let's draw straws
Jack said, ""We should work together""
Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
(La, la, la
La, la, la)

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're goin' to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'II be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare, wheee

I say that we take a cannon, aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

Yes you're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is the meanest guy around
If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town

He'II be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up
Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see

We'II send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until' his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what
Makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is sure to get his kicks

Kidnap the sandy claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage
And then throw away the key",Kidnap the Sandy Claws,1993

In the days of my childhood.
In the evening when the sun was sinking low,
Walking in the wildwood.
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers,
We'd go hand in hand.
Looking back on all the happy hours,
Anyone could understand.

You and me, babe.
Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home, umm, huum

I ran to the terminal building, to fly by my airline
The man said I could ride the wing and I said that was fine
He said ""I'll confirm your reservation, and put the plane on hold""
He came back and said ""Sorry but that wing space just been sold""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay

So, I explained my situation, he said ""That's all right""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home

Next day I thought that I would leave, so I packed my thing again
Waited 14 hours for a taxi to come in
Spotted one that wasn't full and I threw myself in fast

Paul Riddle,"When you can't find the light,
That got you through the cloudy days,
When the stars ain't shinin' bright,
You feel like you've lost you're way,
When those candle lights of home,
Burn so very far away,
Well you got to let your soul shine,
Just like my daddy used to say.
 
He used to say soulshine,
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Hey now people don't mind,
We all get this way sometime,
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.
 
I grew up thinkin' that I had it made,
Gonna make it on my own.
Life can take the strongest man,
Make him feel so alone.
Now and then I feel a cold wind,
Blowin' through my achin' bones,
I think back to what my daddy said,
He said ""Boy, in the darkness before the dawn:""
 
Let your soul shine,
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Yeah now people don't mind,
We all get this way sometimes,
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.
 
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness,
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this.
And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control.
 
Let your soul shine, 
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Lord now people don't mind,
We all get this way sometimes,
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.

I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live

When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'

Still young tryin' to figure it out

Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine

(Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held

They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive

(Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me

And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

Paul Robeson,"In seventy-six the sky was red
thunder rumbling overhead
Bad King George couldn't sleep in his bed
And on that stormy morn, Ol' Uncle Sam was born.
Some birthday! 

Ol' Sam put on a three cornered hat
And in a Richmond church he sat
And Patrick Henry told him that while America drew breath
It was ""Liberty or death."" 

What kind of hat is a three-cornered hat?
Did they all believe in liberty in those days? 

Nobody who was anybody believed it.
Ev'rybody who was anybody they doubted it.
Nobody had faith.
Nobody but Washington, Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin,
Chaim Solomon, Crispus Attucks, Lafayette. Nobodies.
The nobodies ran a trea party at Boston. Betsy Ross
organized a sewing circle. Paul Revere had a horse race. 

And a little ragged group believed it.
And some gentlemen and ladies believed it.
And some wise men and some fools, and I believed it too.
And you know who I am.
No. Who are you mister? Yeah, how come all this?
Well, I'll tell you. It's like this... No let us tell you.
Mister Tom Jefferson, a mighty fine man. 
He wrote it down in a mighty fine plan.
And the rest all signed it with a mighty fine hand
As they crossed thier T's and dotted their I's
A bran' new country did arise. 

And a mighty fine idea. ""Adopted unanimously in Congress July 4, 1776,
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable 
rights.
That among these rights are Life, Yes sir!, Liberty, That's right!
And the pursuit of happiness."" 
Is that what they said? The very words.
That does sound mighty fine. 

Buildiing a nation is awful tough.
The people found the going rough.
Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who anybody they stayed at home.
But Lewis and Clarke and the pioneers,
Driven by hunger, haunted by fears,
The Klondike miners and the forty niners,
Some wanted freedom and some wanted riches,
Some liked to loaf while others dug ditches.
But they believed it. And I believed it too,
And you know who I am.
No, who are you anyway, Mister? 

Well, you see it's like this. I started to tell you.
I represent the whole... Why that's it!
Let my people go. That's the idea!
Old Abe Lincoln was thin and long,
His heart was high and his faith was strong.
But he hated oppression, he hated wrong,
And he went down to his grave to free the slave. 

A man in white skin can never be free while his black brother is in 
slavery,
""And we here highly resolve that these dead shall not haave died in 
vain.
And this government of the people, by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the Earth.""
Abraham Lincoln said that on November 19, 1863 at Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania.
And he was right. I believe that too. 

Say, we still don't know who you are, mister.
Well, I started to tell you...
The machine age came with a great big roar,
As America grew in peace and war.
And a million wheels went around and 'round.
The cities reached into the sky,
And dug down deep into the ground.
And some got rich and some got poor.
But the people carried through,
So our country grew.

Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who was anybody they doubted it.
And they are doubting still,
And I guess they always will,
But who cares what they say whem I am on my way 

Say, will you please tell us who you are?
What's your name, Buddy? Where you goin'? Who are you?
Well, I'm the everybody who's nobody, 
I'm the nobody who's everybody.
What's your racket? What do you do for a living? 

Well, I'm an
Engineer, musician, street cleaner, carpenter, teacher,
How about a farmer? Also. Office clerk? Yes sir!
That's right. Certainly!
Factory worker? You said it. Yes ma'am.
Absotively! Posolutely!
Truck driver? Definitely!
Miner, seamstress, ditchdigger, all of them.
I am the ""etceteras"" and the ""and so forths"" that do the work.
Now hold on here, what are you trying to give us?
Are you an American? 
Am I an American?
I'm just an Irish, Jewish, Italian, 
French and English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish, 
Scotch, Hungarian, Swedish, Finnish, Greek and Turk and Czech 

And that ain't all.
I was baptized Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Luthern, 
Atheist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Presbyterian, Seventh Day Adventist,
Mormon, Quaker, Christian Scientist and lots more.
You sure are something. 

Our country's strong, our country's young, 
And her greatest songs are still unsung.
From her plains and mountains we have sprung,
To keep the faith with those who went before. 

We nobodies who are anybody believe it.
We anybodies who are everybody have no doubts.
Out of the cheating, out of the shouting.

Deep as our valleys,
High as our mountains,
Strong as the people who made it.
For I have always believed it, and I believe it now,
And now you know who I am.
Who are you?
America! America!",Ballad for Americans,1993
Paul Robeson,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Till you've had that mood indigo.

Paul Robeson,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home. 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun; 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,1993

Things seemed so perfect - you know ?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame ?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow

When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,

When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.

",Time To Shine,2008
Paul Rodgers,"I believe there's no evil out there
We didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time for peace
And a time for understanding

Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side, we'll win the game
And some of us believe that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight

I believe there's just once chance in this world
To hear our brothers
Yeah, you believe there's a better way
To listen to each other

We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night, yeah we believe
And we believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

I believe we need a hero to step boldly
From the shadows, yeah
You believe there must be someone
On the scene that fits the bill

A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes, match the intent with the deed

Oh, we believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation
In our time, we believe

We believe there's not a minute
We should be wasting
When the darkness falls
It's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need
That's why we believe

Every father, every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We believe there's a song that's worth the singing
It's a song of truth we're bringing
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun

Yeah, that's what we believe
Hey, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, that's what we believe

Paul Rodgers,"In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling, we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you

You know, my father told me, son don't you rush to be a man 
But I went ahead on, and now I think I'm drowning on dry land 

You know my mother told me the story, about that li'l dog that couldn't see 
Too well 
He was crossing a railroad track one day, when the train cut off a part of 
His tail 
He turned around but never looked up, just to peep over the rail 
And she said he lost his whole head, trying to find a little piece of tail 
That's why I'm going down, my nose is in the sand

Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,
I see the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand.
When the last child cries for a crust of bread,
When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.
When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.

Paul Rudd,"Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role,
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem

Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fish eye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayer
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage",Limelight,2009

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

A good song he was looking for

As bold as he could be
To the place, he heard,
Where the good Prophets used to walk
High above this dark world
Then the Word came down
And the little brother saw
How the Truth was buried on the editing floor

T'check if I said this?
I said, ""Oh boy!
I'd never say that!""

Paul Schmeling,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been

Wise enough to know
That you gotta let yourself grow

What goes around comes back around
This is nature's way
Be conscious of what you do
Because you will be repaid

If you put turnips in the ground
You will not harvest grapes
You are what you attracted
And this is why I say, uhhh

tune you're hearing. this is ofcourse the green onions tune. it was a very big hit in the early sixties in this country. and ofcourse it was composed and recorded in memphis, tennessee, right here
in the united states of america. you know, people, I believe that this tune can be equated with the great classical music around the world.

people I've got something to say to the state department. I say take that archaic monroe doctrine, and that marshall plan that says we're supposed to police force the world, and throw 'em out! let's stay
Home for the next ten years people! stay right here in north america and enjoy the music and culture that is ours. yeah, I got one more thing to say.

I'm just talking about the music, people, and what it does to me. and that is, as you look around the world, you go to the soviet union or great britain or france, you name it, any country... everybody is doing flips and twists just to get into a genuine pair of american blue jeans! and to hear this music and we got it all here in america, the land of the chrysler 440 cubic inch engine!

While I sing to you about a minstrel band
Of children in their witches hats, 
Painting pictures with the pipes of pan

How a young boy and his sister played some tunes 
Upon a whistle made of tin
And led me through the flower gardens, 
Laughing at the postman's stubby chin

And in my dizzy stupor, 
I was trying to forfeit all I'd known
And listen to that music that could swirl me in a magic all it's own

But somewhere in the distance, 
You and I, we fought our monsters to a draw
It was in those days of books and wine, 
With Ferlin Getty grasping for a straw

And out along the highways, 
We journeyed far to find that mystic smile
Chasing down identities, 
My God we must have run a million miles

So we can teach the children, 
Nothing, nothing but survival in the desert bare
They can teach us how to laugh, 
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

So sing for us you children, 
Tinkle bells and rhyme the purple, greens and blues
Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you

Paul Simon,"April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In restless walks she'll prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September I remember
A love once new has now grown old

Paul Simon,"Through the corridors of sleep
Past the shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.
I don't know what is real,
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.
The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right

And I wander in the night without direction.
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.
It's no matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow,
So my fantasy
Becomes reality,
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall",Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall,1965
Paul Simon,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December,
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain.

Paul Simon,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls.

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies.

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day.

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you.

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I",Kathy's Song,1965

And they crumble in your hand

Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl
I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write

[Chorus]

I through a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound

Paul Simon,"He was a most peculiar man
That's what Mrs. Reardon says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone within a house
Within a room, within himself
A most peculiar man

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't
Care
And he wasn't like them
O, no-o-o!
He was a most peculiar man

He died last Sat-you're-day...
He turned on the gas! and he went to sleep!
With the windows closed!
So he'd never wake up!
To his silent world!
And his tiny room!
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere!

Who should be notified so-oo-oon...

And all the people said,
What a shame that he's dead,
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?

Paul Simon,"The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves,
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees,

And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall,
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawL

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow Little room,
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom.

Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me.

From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death,
There are Patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath.

Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies,
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies.

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell,
And it's fitting that it should,
For in darkness I must dwell.

Like the color of my skin,
Or the day that I grow old,
My life is made of Patterns
That can scarcely be controlled",Patterns,1965
Paul Simon,"On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'
A little boy lies asleep in the earth
While down in the valley a cruel war rages
And people forget what a child's life is worth

On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps
And waters the grave with its silent tears
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
That ended a life at the age of seven years

And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'
And generals order their men to kill
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill",The Side of a Hill,1965
Paul Simon,"Hello darkness, my old friend, 
I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping, 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence 

In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence 

And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence 

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you"" 
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon God they made 
And the sign flashed its warning, 
In the words that it was forming 
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets 
Are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls"" 
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Sound of Silence,1965

On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

My mom doin' the laundry, hangin' out shirts in the dirty breeze.
And after it rains there's a rainbow and all of the colors are black.
It's not that the colors aren't there, it's just imagination they lack.

Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.

I was just my father's son. mmm.

Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun.

Still, when I think of the road
we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong

And I dreamed I was dying
And I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
And high up above my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty
Sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying

We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
We come on the ship that sailed the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hour

Maybe my race has been run
Maybe I'm blind

In a taxi heading downtown

I said breakdowns come

So what are you going to do about it

That's what I'd like to know
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall

I said hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be
I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt

You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could

Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
On the very same day

I said hey Senorita that's astute
I said why don't we get together

Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great

I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette

Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
Dancing to Zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck

If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out
These are the roots of rhythm
And the roots of rhythm remain

In early memory
Mission music
Was ringing 'round my nursery door
I said take this child, Lord
From Tucson Arizona
Give her the wings to fly through harmony
And she won't bother you no more

And the strength to push like spring

Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry

And slept on the banks
On the leaves of a banyan tree
And all of these spirit voices rule the night

Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Songs from the mouth of the river
When the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night

By moon 
We walk
To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone
Women with their nursing children
Seated on the floor
We join the fevers
And the broken bones

The candlelight flickers
The falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy â?? heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night

My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
The sweetness in the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo

It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery

You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home

Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place

Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

She loves me again,

Paul Simon,"A family of musicians took shelter for the night
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine
Rose of Jericho and Bougainvillea

This is a lonely life 
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

A trip to the market
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight
Settling over Washington
A trip to the market
A trip around the world
Where the evening meal
Is negotiable, if there is one.

This is a lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something

If I have children

Summer skies and stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah
Summer skies and stars are falling
All along the injured coast

We are standing in the sunlight
The early morning sunlight
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia
To praise a soul's returning to the earth
To the rose of Jericho and the Bougainvillea

To prove that I love you 
Because I believe in you 
Summer skies, stars are falling 
All along the injured coast

And we leave this loathsome little town
Silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots, my baby
Silver foil to trim your wedding gown

A mind wanders
It seems mindless, but it does

As if through reading glasses
And your smile seems softer than it was

Paul Simon,"I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on

But feel the bite
Whenever you believe that
You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends
She moves on

I know the reason I
Feel so blessed

Inside my chest, but she
She is like a top
She cannot stop

Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks
She jumps back
But she moves on

She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ??

Then I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
And I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes

She can't sleep now
The moon is red
She fights a fever
She burns in bed
She needs to talk so
We take a walk
Down in the maroon light

She says â??Maybe these emotions are
As near to love as love will ever beâ??
So I agree
Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on

She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ??

Then I fall to my knees
I grow weak, I go slack
As if she'd captured the breath of my
Voice in a bottle
And I can't catch it back

But I feel good

The way the sun hits off the run way
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts

Paul Simon,"It was a slow day 
And the sun was beating 
On the soldiers by the side of the road 
There was a bright light 
A shattering of shop windows 
The bomb in the baby carriage 
Was wired to the radio

And it curled into the circle of birth 
And the dead sand

And the automatic earth

This is the long distance call 
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo

The way we look to a distant constellation

These are the days of miracle and wonder 
And don't cry baby, don't cry 
Don't cry 

It's a turn-around jump shot 
It's everybody jump start 
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts 
Medicine is magical and magical is art 
The boy in the bubble 
And the baby with the baboon heart 

And I believe 
These are the days of lasers in the jungle 
Lasers in the jungle somewhere 
Staccato signals of constant information 
A loose affiliation of millionaires 
And billionaires and baby

Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes boss, the government handshake
Yes boss, the crusher of language
Yes boss, Mr. Stillwater
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run

Who says: Hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears","The Cool, Cool River",1993

Paul Simon,"Well I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep through the night
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

And in remembering a road sign
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And we said these songs are true
These days are ours
These tears are free
And hey
The cross is in the ballpark
The cross is in the ballpark

We had a lot of fun
We had a lot of money
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
Sonny gets married and moves away
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
Sonny gets sunnier
Day by day by day by day

I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some roots are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down on the shelf
And he idle thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night
Some people say a lie is just a lie
But I say
The cross is in the ballpark
Why deny the obvious child?",The Obvious Child,1993
Paul Simon,"Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blowin' through the grass
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears

",Old Friends,1993
Paul Simon,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,1993
Paul Simon,"Moves like a fist through traffic
Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump 
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes Boss. The government handshake
Yes Boss. The crusher of language
Yes Boss. Mr. Stillwater,
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run

Who says: Hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears","The Cool, Cool River [Live]",1993
Paul Simon,"There may come a time
When you'll be tired
As tired as a dream
That wants to die

And further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

Maybe you will find a love
That you discover accidentally
Who falls against you gently
As a pickpocket brushes your thigh

Further to fly

Effortless music from the Cameroons
The spinning darkness of her hair
A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere
The open palm of desire wants everything
It wants everything, it wants everything

Sometimes I'll be walking down
The street and I'll be thinking
Am I crazy
Or is this some morbid little lie

Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

A recent loss of memory
A shadow in the family
The baby waves bye-bye
I'm trying, I'm flying

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my light
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire
Wants everything, it wants everything
It wants soil as soft as summer
And the strength to push like spring

A broken laugh, a broken fever
Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry

Further to fly

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my sight
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire
The rose of Jericho
Soil as soft as summer
The strength to let you go

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma

If the heart is an open memory book
That was the chance I took
The more I searched
The more I shook for Thelma

Last night I slept on a rented pillow
A silver moon above my head
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed

Now the first time that I saw you I thought
She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught
People aware of my history
Trying to steer you away from me
I left a message at your hotel
Don't let management poison the well

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma

The phone is ringing and I realize
We are time zones and oceans apart
The words I speak in the middle of my night
Fall on your yesterday's heart

If the sun don't shine
If the wind don't break
If the clock don't jump off the wall
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair
For a long time, now

The dishes are done,
The buildings here, tall as our mountains 
Sliced through the windows and cut off the sun.

On such days I find I am longing for Puerto Rico
Though I never would return 'til you are free
But when I hear the Aguinaldo my heart's a little lighter
And we danced together Aurea and me

In my life I've been unlucky with two husbands
Gumersindo liked his rum and women friends
Then that hypocrite who beat you and preached about repentance 
Has gone, and so another Sunday ends

And tomorrow is another hard working Monday
I'm still hoping for the raise they promised me
There's a job as operator 
I would not have to wait for
If I could speak the language easily

Never thought I could

Paul Simon,"A passenger traveling quietly conceals himself
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Over the crest of the mountains the moon
Begins its climb

And he wakes to find he's in rolling farm land

The farmer sleeps against his wife
He wonders what their life must be
A trailways bus is heading south into
Washington, D.C.

A mother and child, the baby maybe two
Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding
The shadow of the capitol dome
Slides across his face
And his heart is racing with the urge to
Freedom
The father motionless as stone
A shepherd resting with his flock
The trailways bus is turning west
Dallas via Little Rock

Oh my darling darling Sal
The desert moon is my witness
I've no money to come east
But I know you'll soon be here

We pull into downtown Dallas by the
Sight of the grassy knoll
Where the leader fell and a town was broken
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken

The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus
Any aliens here you better check with us
How about you son you like you've got
Spanish blood
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood

Yes I am an alien from Mars
I come to earth from outer space
And if I traveled my whole life
You guys would still be on my case
You guys would still be on my case

Peaceful as a hurricane, peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane eye
Peaceful as a hurricane, peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane eye, peaceful as a hurricane eye

You wanna be a leader?
You wanna change the game?
Turn your back on money
Walk away from fame?

You wanna be a missionary?
You got that missionary zeal?
Let a stranger change your life
How does that make you feel?

You wanna be a writer
You don't know how or when?
Find a quiet place
Use a humble pen

You wanna talk, talk, talk about it
All night squawk about the ocean and the atmosphere
Well, I've been away for a long time
And it looks like a mess around here

And I'll be away for a long time
So here's how the story goes
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe
She was bakin' a cinnamon pie

She fell asleep in a washing machine
Woke up in a hurricane eye

",Hurricane Eye [Live][*],2000
Paul Simon,"The first time I heard 'Peggy Sue', I was twelve years old
Russians up in a rocket ships and the war was cold
Now many wars have come and gone, genocide still goes on
Buddy Holly still goes on, but his catalog was sold

First time I smoked, guess what, paranoid
First time I heard 'Satisfaction', I was young and unemployed
Down the decades every year, summer leaves and my birthday's here
And all my friends stand up and cheer

Say man you're old
Getting old
You're old
You're getting old

We celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas Day
And Buddha found Nirvana along the Lotus Way
About fifteen hundred years ago the messenger Mohammed spoke
And his wisdom like a river flowed through hills of gold

Wisdom is old
The Koran is old
The Bible is old
Greatest story ever told

Disagreements?
Work 'em out

The human races walked the Earth for two point seven million
And we estimate the universe about thirteen to fourteen billion
When all these numbers tumble into your imagination
Consider that the Lord was there before creation

God is old
We're not old
God is old
He made the mold

Take your clothes off
Adam and Eve

",Old [Live][*],2000
Paul Simon,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders 
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
And cut him till he cried out 
In his anger and his shame, 
""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
But the fighter still remains 
Lie-la-lie",The Boxer [DVD],2000
Paul Simon,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
But I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",I Am a Rock [DVD],2000
Paul Simon,"I was reading a magazine 
And thinking of a rock and roll song 
The year was 1954 
And I hadn't been playing that long 
When a man came on the radio 
And this is what he said 
He said I hate to break it 
To his fans 
But Johnny Ace is dead 
 
Well, I really wasn't 
Such a Johnny Ace fan 
But I felt bad all the same 
So I sent away for his photograph 
And I waited till it came 
It came all the way from Texas 
With a sad and simple face 
And they signed it on the bottom 
From the Late Great Johnny Ace 
 
It was the year of the Beatles 
It was the year of the Stones 
It was 1964 
I was living in London 
With the girl from the summer before 
It was the year of the Beatles 
It was the year of the Stones 
A year after J.F.K. 
We were staying up all night 
And giving the days away 
And the music was flowing 
Amazing 
And blowing my way 
 
On a cold December evening 
I was walking through the Christmas tide 
When a stranger came up and asked me 
If I'd heard John Lennon had died 
And the two of us 
Went to this bar 
And we stayed to close the place 
And every song we played 
Was for the Late Great Johnny Ace",The Late Great Johnny Ace [DVD],2000
Paul Simon,"If you ever awake
In the mirror of a bad dream

And for a fraction of a second,
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memories
Upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star

I believe the light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever
(forever)
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary
Hidin' under your bed
I'm gonna
Stand guard
Like the postcard
Of the golden retriever
And never leave
'Til I leave you
With a sweet dream in your head

I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two

There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you

Trust your intuition
It's just like going fishin'
You cast your line and
Hope you get a bite

But you don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the marketplace
Trying to help the human race
Struggling to survive
It's as harsh as night

I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two

There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you

Got a ticket for my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

[Chorus]
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

[Chorus]

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Paul Simon,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence [Album Version],2003

When no one was awake
She drove across the border
Leaving all the yellow roses on her wedding cake
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order

She's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment, a chip in time
When leaving home is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see
Another life, another galaxy

That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow
She hears the clouds
She sees the eye of a hurricane
As it sweeps across her island pillow

I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine

But if I ever get back to the twentieth century
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts
Open the book of my vanishing memory
With its catalogue of regrets
Stand up for the deeds I did
And those I didn't do
Sit down, shut up, think about God
And wait for the hour of my rescue

We don't mean to mess things up
But mess them up we do
And then it's ""Oh, I'm sorry""
Here's a smiling photograph of love it was new
At a birthday party

Make a wish and close your eyes: surprise, surprise, surprise.

Frost creeping over the pond
I shoot a thought into the future
And it flies like an arrow
Through my lifetime, and beyond

Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite

Is down on the shelf

I went back to my place
No moon that night
But a heavenly light shone on my face

Still I thought it was odd
There was no sign of God just to usher me in
Then a voice from above
Sugar coated with love, said, ""Let us begin""

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Okay, a new kid in school
Got to follow the rule
You got to learn the routine
Woah, there's a girl over there
With the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen

I said, ""Hey, what you say?
It's a glorious day,
By the way how long you been dead?""
Maybe you, maybe me
Maybe baby makes three
But she just shook her head

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line
Just to glimpse the divine
What you think about that?

Well it seems like our fate to suffer
And wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line
No one here, likes a sneak

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

After you climb, up the ladder of time
The Lord God is here
Face to face, in the vastness of space
Your words disappear

And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,
And the current is strong
But all that remains when you
Try to explain is a fragment of song

Lord is it, be bop a lu la
Or ooh poppa do
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do
Be bop a lu la",The Afterlife,2011

An empty sky, a hidden mound of stone
But the CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing
Nowadays, when everything is known
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue
Dazzling blue

Miles apart, though the miles can't measure distance
Worlds apart on a rainy afternoon
But the road gets dirty and it offers no resistance
So turn your amp up and play your lonesome tune
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue

Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen
To make a marriage bed
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue

And walked along the cliffs above the sea
And we wondered why, and imagined it was someday

Orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips

I know that's an old songwriting cliche
Loved you the first time I saw you
Can't describe it any other way

Clouds of antelope rolled by
No hint of rain to come
In the prairie sky
It's just love, love, love, love, love

When the rains came, the tears burned, windows rattled, locks turned
It's easy to be generous when you're on a roll
It's hard to be grateful when you're out of control
And love is gone

Is the quiet dawn
The bedroom breathes
In clicks and clacks

Move their cardboard blankets

Who am I in this lonely world?
And where will I make my bed tonight?
When twilight turns to dark

Fools and pilgrims all over the world

And you don't get what you bargain for
Can you get your money back?
If an empty train in a railroad station
Calls you to its destination
Can you choose another track?

With my hair as white as the morning moon?

And all the buildings on it
Should disappear
Would a zebra grazing in the African Savannah
Care enough to share one zebra tear?

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while i was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams i walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light i saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that i might teach you,
Take my arms that i might reach you.""

And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""the words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie la lie",The Boxer,2012

Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah

And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""

As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to the shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church.
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

A wild boy from the streets of El Barrio
An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race.

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and batter",Loves Me Like a Rock [Acoustic Demo] [Demo Version],2015

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Paul Smith,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1957

Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire

My mama done told me, she said Son
A woman will sweet-talk ya, she'll give you the big eye
But when that sweet talkin' is done

A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Now the rain's a fallin', hear the train a callin', oooo-ee
Hear the lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, oooo-ee

Oooo-ee-a-oooo-ee, ol' clickety-clack
Comes echoing back the blues in the night
The evening breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moonlight will hide its light

When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird
He will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds seem to blow
I've been in some big towns and I've heard me some big talkin'

But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
She's a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Got a case of the blues in the night
Don't know what to do
Blues every night
It's all because of you

To ensure the survival of each brand new arrival.

Is forever blowin' bubbles too.

Every field wears a bonnet
With some spring daisies on it,
Even birds of a feather show their clothes off together.

Sun's gettin' shinery, to spotlight the finery,

Spring, Spring, Spring.

From his eerie, the eagle with his eagle eye
Gazes down across his eagle beak
And a'fixin' his lady with the legal eye
Screams ""suppose we fix the date this week!""

That it's all one supposes

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1996
Paul Speckmann,"Lessons in might, lessons in stress
Teachings of right, reasons of less
Seekers of strength, only they guess
Will they proceed, or will they suppress
Frequent, illusive, you have the power to follow the one
Decisive, conclusive, the fall of the world has just begun
Wasteful, astounding, violence and force is the only way
Corrupted, misguided, we will lose thousands of people today
The fall of priest Hussein
Allah is to blame
Islamic fools of war
Soon will live no more
Ablative, abeyance, depriving the world with disruption of peace
Deceitful, fascists, holding the fate of the world in our hands
Harmonic, defiance, taking for granted the gift human life
Ironic, compliance, testing the fruits of their progressive toys
Will trade our blood for oil
Until our hands have been soiled
Civilians, pawns and kings
Will pay the penalty
The countdown of the endless problems
All the endless fools soon brought down
Never knowing where they've fallen
Has our Creator been calling
Countless bodies, piles of ashes
Severed mortar, wasteful clashes
Is the worth the whole disaster
Is the life, we're dying faster
Seasons of death, a game of chess
Leaders of pawns, where do they spawn
Just raised for war, to open the door
The door of demise, the deadly surprise
",Blood for Oil,2007
Paul Speckmann,"The streets and the cities
The alleys of woe
The forces of hatred
Are out of control
The lurk in the fields
Alone in the night
A sickly perversion, excursion
That's not in sight
(Bible passage)
He travels he streets
Different weapons in hand
He searches for victims
Befriends the demand
Ridding the world of
The homeless disease
Laughing out loudly
Ignoring their pleas
Victims of the chosen
Have been clearly marked and pushed aside
Many body parts were frozen
Simply just a waste of life
Eating the flesh of the virgins
The taste of blood
Picking the brains of desertion
Forever more
Stabbing the hearts of the weakened society
Killing the worthless for pleasure now
Raping the dead it's so silent
A twist of fate
A wave of sick violence
A question of give and take
Taxpayers earning just
Feed them the deathly row
The chair gathers dust
As they age in their cell
Documented murders often
Skip the press and go unsolved
Morbid visions, gross divisions
Multiply the cause of death
You fucking heathen!
Go back to hell, where you fucking came from!

Never ending road to death
Neveer near the home stretch
Lack of guidance, sudden trust
Will they soon forget the loss

Designit in charge of lives
Will they cross the final bridge
Will they parish in a ditch
Pull the plug, the right to drive a privalege
Stop the fools, don't override decision
Pull the plug, the right to die your option
He's the judge, allows this to continue
Best of all evils are never deprived
Consumed by the handfuls and ruining our lives
Violent cutback the system avoids
Protecting the children, from dangerous exploits
Buy a license from the state
Such a little price to pay
Drive them all to sudden death
Pull the plug and gain respect

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

When I was just a baby, mama sat me on her knee

Paul Stanley,"My eyes were burnin' 
Lookin' back on all of my memories 
And my mind was dreamin like it does 
She wore white and in the night we made love 
Together, I remember, together as one 

It came so easy 
But now it seems so long ago 
My chance is fading into night 
I can't change or rearrange what I've done 
Together, I remember, together as one 
Together, I remember, together as one 

Yesterday, is far away, so take me out to sea 
Far away, I've been what never will be 
Check me in, to lose or win, I'm livin' memories 
The drift begins, the dream of it sets me free 

We lived each moment as if the days would never end 
It seemed our lives had just begun 
I can't stay, I'll make my way on the run 
Together, I remember, together as one 
Together, I remember, together as one

It's electric when our souls collide 
Girl I need it

No more aiming at my heart

I feel invincible when lying next to you
You've got the arrows bouncing off my skin 
I lost a love before, this time I'm gonna win

You make me oh, yeah

Paul Stanley,"Do you remember when you said I was the only one?
We'll watch the years go passing by
I never dreamed that with a love I thought had just begun
I'd ever hear you say goodbye

When we meet and I start smiling
And I'm just lying through my tears, baby

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Every time I see you around

I go to places but it's not the way it used to be
I only picture you and I
My friends all tell me I can push you from my memory
There's only so much I can try

When I touch your hand to greet you
I'm not sure that I'll let go, baby

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Every time I see you

I find my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about you
How can somebody else take your place
I can't stand it

I find my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about you
How can somebody else take your place
When the things that I do bring me closer to you

When I say, I can't stand it, no
Do you remember when you said I was the only one?

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat

Paul Stanley,"You tell me what you want 
And you try to tell me what I need 
But your smile can never sell me what I don't believe

Now the gun is in your hand 
And all the words are on your tongue 
They gave you everything when you were young 
You threw it all away when you were done 
You pray you found the chosen someone

[Chorus:]
It's not me 
I don't wanna be 
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior 
Now there's danger every second that you breathe

It's not me 
I don't wanna be 
Another truth cuts like a razor 
You're gonna have to save yourself 
You better look for someone else

You turn the world your way 
And you lose the truth within your lies 
But the feeling that you crave, money never buys 
(Money never buys)

All the warnings come too late 
And your body starts to scream 
And if you think you see me in your dreams

[Chorus:]

No, it's not me 
I don't wanna be 
Another truth cuts like a razor 
You better look for someone else

When you run in a world full of trouble 
Trouble always runs to you anyway 
Now the damage is done and you want me to stay

Paul Stanley,"Falling like the rain 
Crashing down again 
Sinking all alone

I've never known

I never wanted to ever hurt you 
The trust is broken 
Salvation

Lift me, lift me up 
Forgive me with your touch 
Lift me, higher 
Straight to your love

Shaken to the ground 
Fear is wrapped around me 
Fighting for my life

Shattered by the truth 
Scattered like the ashes 
All that's left of you and I 
I've realized

All you wanted 
Was something real 
And now I'm haunted

[Chorus]

I hear the howling of the wind 
It's crying out your name 
I'd give my soul if we could start 
All over,
All over again

Paul Stanley,"Frustrated, degraded, down before you're done
Rejection, depression, can't get what you want
You ask me how I make my way
You ask me everywhere and why
You hang on every word I say
But the truth sounds like a lie

[Chorus:]
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall

Obsessive, compulsive, suffocate your mind
Confusion, delusions, kill your dreams in time
You ask me how I took the pain
Crawled up from my lowest low
Step by step and day by day
'Till there's one last breath to go

Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win

Paul Stanley,"We both had stories, loves, and lifetimes before 
Left us wanting for more 
But it kept us on that journey 
With everyone we meet, we open the door 
There were others for sure, but they never got to know me

It's all a way to a life worth living 
So don't mistake what I'm givin'

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
Let me hear the words I'm sayin' 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through 
You might not be the first 
But for me your always second to none

Sometimes the fears we have will get in the way 
And the things that people say can make it so much harder 
The chance for love can look you right in the eye 
Yet it passes you by

So live a life with no happy ending 
But I won't lose it all pretending

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
Let me hear the words I'm sayin' 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through 
But for me your always second to none

Life has a way of making things brighter, lighter 
Don't throw it away, it takes a way to see clearly 
Believe me

It's all a way to a life worth living 
So don't mistake what I'm givin'

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through

Paul Stanley,"In a bed in my room 
All wrapped up in my own cocoon 
In my head I see you 
Like I'm stuck in a déja-vu

And it's always the same mind games 
It's a dangerous situation, insane 
It's a warp on my soul and I've lost all control

[Chorus:]
When I'm all alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming 
9-1-1, no one hears my cries 
I break up, I wake up screaming

Why must I grieve 
For a lie that I still believe 
It's a waste, what a sin 
It's a fight I can never win

Anywhere that I go, you go 
Baby, even in my own reflection, you show 
Like a ghost by my side with a hold on my mind

Nine o' clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car, and I try to make the midnight show

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Movin' fast, doin' 95
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio
It goes

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why
