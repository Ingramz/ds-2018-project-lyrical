No matter how hard I try
And I've tried
Well I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired
As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what your missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and
Tell me a lie

Well you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time
And well there must have been a time
I was the reason for that smile
Keep in mind
As you take whats left of you and I

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what your missing baby
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight

Turn the light off
If I wanna be with you
I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this
Even though I try

Heartbeats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment, in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded
Like tonight's sky

Hands are silent
Voice's numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face.

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment, in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Flashing lights in my mind
Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls at my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all

You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this

I'll find the words to say

The memories they came flooding back
Blowing out birthday candles
I was dressed as superman and you were a shining star

We would have only been in fourth grade
My sweet blue eyed childhood valentine
All these years and I miss you so much

First star I see tonight
I'll make a wish I hope comes true

I'd even search the stars for you
I'd even send a satellite

To find a piece of kryptonite
To have you right here by my side
I miss you / I wish you were right here
I need you right here by my side

Everyday after class I'd carry your books
You would hold my hand and say to me
That when we grow up we'd get married
But time has a habit of bringing with it change
We've moved away / grown up and grown apart
Sometimes I lay awake and wonder 
if your thinking about me
Like I think about you?

Will I ever see you again?",Satellite,2002
One Dollar Short,"I want to light a match and set you on fire
I want to watch you fall twelve stories / to the sidewalk below I want to hold a loaded gun to your head semi Automatic 15 rounds / one in the chamber

The edges of twilight burning are burning / the sky and the stars are falling a Valium heartbeat
Insomnia / I can't even think straight

Another daydream about my 
Hands around your throat
Your turning blue
Poison in your breakfast cereal
I'll watch you wriggle on the linoleum
Like an insect dying

I'll watch you gasp for air
For your last remaining seconds

One Dove,"The moon, the moonlight
Casts no shadow for me to hide
The stars, or maybe they're satellites
But neither can grant my wish tonight

And if the moon is an aid to romance everywhere
Why is the night so full of dark despair
And only dark can wax and wane
And the small hours are hard to bear

(Cry)
Breakdown and cry (I Cry for you)
Breakdown and cry (Cry)
Breakdown and cry
Cry (I do)

The clouds, heavy and grey
Make me wonder why I stay
Alone, every night
And every day is just the same

I remember the night you left me
The moon was full, I felt empty
Tides and werewolves may be turned
But you don't know how to cry

Forgive me, 'cause I was only thinking of you

I'm falling

Well, for a long time, all he wanted was to save me
He was weaving his words around me, just like chains
The closer we were, the lower he whispered

They say we have too much

When all we want to have is fun
And why this empty space

I'm falling

Did he touch me
Does he surround me like the air in this room
Oh I can walk inches higher than the floor
But if you want to know the truth

I'm falling

I don't know, why I'm telling you any of this
One thing is, don't ever tell anyone I told you this

So I lace up these hard black shoes
And look - more work

What's going on

For the night""

(Chorus) 
So tell me you need me and I will stay 
You believe me and I will wait 
That you'd come back for me every time I fall 
In your heart there's just no place 
There's no room to make a mistake 
And with one wrong turn you would never make it home 

(Bridge) 
If you want me 
Then you got me 
Just never leave me alone 

(Chorus) 
So tell me you need me and I will stay 
You believe me and I will wait 
That you'd come back for me every time I fall 
Tell me your heart will never change 
That you'll always feel the same 
That you'll stand beside me even if you think I'm wrong 
I was wrong 

If you want me 
Then you got me 
Just never leave me alone...

After the rain has come and gone
And the sun still won't shine
After your friends have walked away
And you run out of words to say
After you try everything else
Try me

Life can make you cry 
And hurt you deep inside
I promise you I know the pain you feel
So if you let me love you I can chase those clouds away
I will fill your world with joy and all your wrong I will erase

My ways are in pain, from the strain of my ways
Chains engraved in my physical days, in physical waves
I get physical strength from my individual ways
Meanwhile I'm not fulfilled, this feeling shall not be stilled
Rewind time and rewrite lines for the kinds of you to feel
Docile if you so will, fragile and you go downhill
Drinking wine, forgetting time, now time to be refilled
They say if you snooze you loose
Well I spend my days, dazed and confused
Is it cause I blaze all day and fade, then that's old news
If it's new to you, this is Yarah rapping the blues
Don't get used to it, running mascara I refuse
Closed doors prevent outsiders from viewing
But struggling alone makes it tough for pursuing
Dreams, but it seems all I get are sleepless nights
Nightmares about losing loved ones and losing fights

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

You take drugs to psyche your mind
You take wine, to forget about time
You create a world of your own
Where the truth, will never be known

I work when the work seems like play
And hate to play when the work seems to work my way, I say
I work my way through everyday that I play my way
Now..
Hear what I say, hear what I say
Makes it all seem hopeless like impending cancellations
The locks will open someday continued determination
Restless infection destroys spiritual vaccinations
And I will head for my destination
I stand alone at the crossroads of death inhale the breath
Of lost souls that left in and out of consciousness
Drinking wine reminds me of what honest is
Making me wonder where the hell the logic is?
We're all lost, we're all tossed, at a lost cause
Fight between ourselves, relieve ourselves, and then we all fall
Through the wall, through it all, who we are?
No denying that at 5 foot I still stand tall

As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

One Self,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours

I am the skeleton in every closet.
All the things you hide, don't want no one to see...
Those are the things that make up me.

I thought I'd figure things out while I was gone
Instead I realize that I am just more alone.
Don't need this disappointment. The guessing who's to blame.
Let me go home and face my shame.

I'm not sure how I feel, I'm not certain it's real
I don't know if you need to know.
I can hear when you pray but it won't make me stay
And I think you already know.

[Chorus]

I'm not sure how I feel, I'm not certain it's real

As I sit and think about yesterday
I feel the pain inside (oh yeah)
All the troubles that burden my mind
They can't be pushed inside

So I'm counting on your love to guide me home
Thought these chapters of my life (uh huh)
You're my angel through the storm
(And you know I'll always love ya)
You're what keeps me going strong

Chorus:
Don't you know that mama ya k now I love ya
And if I could I'd build my world around ya

Goes on and on dear lord I pray for healing
Wishing that you never went away
Nowl ike just ain't gonna be the same

2nd Verse:
Even though you're not
Here with me today
I still feel you around me
In every singe way

Missin' the times that you would hold me close 
When I needed you the most (oh yeah)
Wiped the teardrops from my eyes
And walked with me through the storms of life

Verse1: I never asked for the world
Just a little piece of your heart
And you gave me the best that you could
I never thought what we shared could ever fall apart.

It's so bad we gave up a chance
Can't explain how I missed all this romance
We slowly fell out of touch (ooh ooh oh)
Cause I hurt so bad, I don't wanna be sad no more.
(Chorus)

Verse2: If I chose to stay would things ever change
For the better, oh how I wish that they could
I'd never ask you to rearrange your life for me, hey.

So glad we let love take it's path
It was you (who showed me the beauty of love)
And although it just could not last
(You mean more to me than you did before whooooooo)

I met this guy a year ago
Somewhere down south in Mexico
He was dancin' and he was baskin'
And I was thinking Damn have to have him
I slash right by to catch his eye
Looked out for a minute
And there he was goin by
We're Hangin' and he was wealthy
And I was going oohh Sema Hundai

Guess I was caught up (Quit playin)
To blame that funny up/stuff
If I would of known back then
(I) probably wouldn't test my luck(Quit Playin)
Playin his silly games
(He) killed me with his touch (Quit Playin)
Killin me with his kiss

We were speeding all down the highway
We were kissing and rubbin
So addictive to his lovin'

One more year and nothing changed
Government policies still the same
The futures bleak and life's a bore
So what the fuck are we living for

give us a future don't you let us down
Give us a future show us some concern
Give us a future don't you watch us drown
Give us a future or we'll put you down

government schemes a waste of time
Don't pretend to be a friend of mine
You want my vote and tell me lies
Then all I get is victimized

promises and bullshit is all I hear
Living in danger, not in fear
Won't get my vote that's for sure
Don't come knocking on my door

Long time ago -- remember our deal? Not just friends but family
Bare-face lies both sides of the fence, all you have to do is believe in me
To front the sounds in the public eye was your sense of the security

Guilty. You were the guilty, get the right story before you accuse me.

Your visionary guides the path we took, to the places that were right for you
Ties have to be broke, and bullshit dried up. Work it out, that will never do
Crawls back again to agree in vain, out trust and friendship took the strain
To all the people who you think they know -- we ain't about to lie down

And a man can wander

To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide

Why do we miss what we never had

Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way.
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe.

La luce che tu dai
Nel cuore restera
A ricordarci che
L'eterna stella sei.

I pray we'll find your light,
And hold it in our hearts
When stars go out each night,
Remind us where you are..

Nella mia preghiera
Quanta fede c'e.
Lead us to a place ?

Let this be our prayer
When shadows fill our day
Guide us with your grace

Give us faith so we'll be safe.

Sogniamo un mondo senza piu violenza,
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza.
Ognuno dia una mano al suo vicino,
Simbolo di pace, di fraternita.

La forza che ci dai
E desiderio te
Ognuno trovi amor
Intorno e dentro se.
Let this be our prayer,
Just like every child.

We ask that life be kind
And watch us from above
We hope each soul will find
Another soul to love.

Just like every child.

Needs to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Sento che ci salverai.",The Prayer,2012
Only Crime,"Climbing on another one
Racing for the higher ground
We separate all the civil serenades
Into hollow sounds

And I'm yours
I'm waiting just behind your eyes
Weighed down a heavy heart
And a mind grown cold with lies

On time
Just when you get it
You brace yourself against the furthest fall
You'll never get it
Just like the rest of the starving millions
Find out on your own
The luck ones are the dead and dying
No tears or wasted lines
When it all wears through

A sick cell I'm not well
I feel things that I'll never tell
Keep slipping further from a space just south of sane

And you can see my skin crawl
While your face grows white
I'll destroy your world in a day
I'm gonna make your fuckers pay
It's all

All I've said and all I've forced
To pick you up to fix it all
We set aside our selfish goals
Thick as blood we lose control
Inside ourselves absolve all sin
The bravest shade surround and win
The wounds are dressed and it's said and done
No other side it's over

Trying breathing
Still we suffer all the same
We are bleeding
Only emptiness remains",Virus,2004
Only Crime,"Right now like a step outside
My heart beats genocide
Tearing out all the crippled walls
Drawing fire from the mortal flaws

To take it in on the chin, don't want to face it
We generate our debate to try to place it
Fear the eyes of the blind and the fallen
We cauterize as the dream comes crashing down

And like a poison will coerce you
To the very brink of salient pathologies
Your own disease
And with the whole wide world against you
Is it any wonder that it brings you to your knees?

Make war on the fractured climes
Where the infirmed all run on time
I've cried for much less than you
And taken all your pain

Just like a lie you want to throw in the fire
That's how it feels to be exposed as a liar
You fall in line when there's nothing real
It takes hold of everything you feel

Your fear surrounds my soul
Your fear creates my light
Your words are not my life
No time to get it right
Your words are not my life
No time, gotta live but there's no

Time will take me down, it breaks me
Drowning in civility and losses justified
Words like tokens, eyes wide open
Staring down the epitaphs of virtue long denied",Take Me,2007

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah

A light hits the gloom on the grey

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say

As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain

'Cause it took too long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no!

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it

Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire

Only Men Aloud,"I stood strong through right or wrong
I fought pain with time and hate 
Here I stand alone and on fire in a room with a view, a fence with barbwire 
Today my world ends and so theirs begins

Slowly trying to justify comparable sins 
I stand here alone and unafraid
I've known in my past I've done worse days
May be apart from my dreams and desires yet no man can withhold me from what I most admire

I stood strong through right or wrong
I fought pain with time and hate
I'll fight when they try to strip me of my rights and wont, I wont accept defeat

You're pure magic, unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
And so I say with no restraint, be mine, be mine

I'm not asking you to marry me

And the rain? tossed about us;
In the garden of the world

Past the gold between the anvils of the stars

And the streets where I remember
Where the fire lights
Are candle souls again;

Affirming flame,
Hear me call;
Through the darkness,
Hear it call to us all

And stir again;
This beating heart
Comes again

And the joy drive out our pain
And the nations come to greet us
Waving open arms like waves of golden corn

Alone and abandoned

Feeling the wind and the icy cold rain
Feeling each step, destiny hidden 
All to aware of the fear and the pain
Feeling the sting of true betrayal 
Now I have no one to trust but myself
I am now one, no more believer 
Yet there is still wind to fill my sail

A paradise I seek shall be found 
The only one I'll know
I challenge failure to cut me down 
Cause it's onward I shall go
My power strength shall never die
As long as I stay alive
One word shall always be by my side 
Ever moving onward!!!!

Battles I've won, 
The war I have lost 
My blood and my tears 
They are equally spilled
The risk I shall take, 
The feel of the cost
The prophecies of shattered dreams 
Now fulfilled
The specters they watch, 
I can hear them laugh 
Yet I will impale onto their doubting eyes
Victory due one of these days 
Revenge will silently 
Come all in due time

Onward on, never underestimate my force of will
Onward on, never I will hesitate to know 
That I will fight!!

Onward I walk, with each step now close
But closer to something that might not be there
Using the rage, feeling the hunger 
The book that I read always has a new page
Come strike me down, take all that you need 
Resilience is my new found weapon of choice
Again I will rise, one day I will win
As long as I sing onward cry from my voice!!",Onward,2001

Plus some grease to give it a shine

Move by the millions and children stay rough

I flip it, get wicked, and wild when I spot him

Go downstairs, shake hands with her father
Say you need her back, no dad don't bother
Excuse me mister sir, but your daughter gets the rawest

It's not everyday you get to be a genuine witness

So take off your bra, show your breasts and move your dress
Yo what's the matter hooker, cat got your tongue?
Or do you want my tongue to get your cat and get you strung
I got the whip appeal, plus chains and bats
And always wear hats, for flippin in the puddy cats
Once it's in there's no turnin back
Move your feet, to your head, til you hear your bone crack
When bitches get dick they don't know how to act
And once you go black, you never go back
I don't discriminate and just leave it at that
I'm just one, stinky kinky, slim not slinky
Fiddle with your clitoris then pop your pussy with my pinky
Tryin to get yours, I'm tryin to get minor

Titty strangler, rougher than a Wrangler
Guaranteed to make em bleed they need paper satisfaction
Big butt cheeks the funky breakbeat action
Leavin the hoes, smackin the hoes, leavin em on the subway
Lost without a care but can't walk cause that ass is broken
First date, veteran, better than a nympho
Sleek to the beat cause I be fuckin on tempo
Train like a trolley, lick her like a lolli
I smoke more cheeba than motherfuckin Bob Marley
Lady persuader, big panty raider
Four times a week I get stuck on the elevator
La la, live to die
Tricked on this slick and went way past her why
Jack B. Nimble, Jack B. Quick
He got too slick, now he got a sick dick
Cause I don't really really give a fuck
Praise the Lord, cause even nuns get stuck
Never play me like a burger, I'm never double cheesy
Easy Rider or writer, stinky never fighter
Try to get yours, cause I know I'm gonna get minor

If ya, got a girl then you betta believe
She got a, dick up her throat and a trick up her sleeve
But if ya don't take my word, take the word of another
I love my girl more than I love my own mother
until I caught the bitch in bed fuckin my brother
Now, pussy to me, is a stick and a bone 
I fuck it and she suck it then I leave it alone
then get out the crib 'fore her man come home
DING-DONG!  RING-A-LING-A-LING!!
""Honey I'm home,"" scumbag sent candy
Feelin damn dandy crazy drunk off some brandy
Headed to the stairs, tip-tiptoed
With these sneaky ass stairs kid ya gotta move slow
She wasn't in her room, where could she be?
Wait a cotton-pickin minute, I hear the TV
I slid to the den, what did I see?
I seen a nigga hairy STINK ass (word??)
and my girl on her knees (OHHH SHIT!)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Hey man, I was just watchin this, it was monotonous

You can say like Mary J., ""Just Remind Me""
Was buggin when she started suckin fuckin peppermints
Blow jobs got better? (How the hell ya miss those hits?) I know but
then I got the shock that almost blocked me like an obstacle
My girl lips locked a niguz cock, like a popsicle
Quick - my man flipped the silencer tip
Now let the dumb bitch go to hell, and suck on the devil's dick
Yep, you knew money felt the chill
He should have ate that pussy then it coulda been his last meal
So don't let my girl suck ya dick
Even if she's suckin the next niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)

DEAD!  Dead on arrival, forget the fame
The game is survival, you know my name (uh-huh)
I throw blows in the world of the rap war
Tap jaws of crews, bruise 'em on tour

The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

I've come to suck the blood upon a microphone
Gaze deep into my eyes, I'll make you turn to stone
It be, ""Night of the Walking Dead"" 
if you don't leave me the hell alone
Cause rap ain't no game but I'm playin for keeps
I live in the Rotten Apple, the city that never sleeps
STOP! You try to steal my style and got spotted
Niggaz can't get it, cause niggaz ain't got it
I've been a bald head since the, age of ten
Plus I'm a ruthless crook and, I was born in Crooklyn
So a stick up, is a piece of cake for
the kid with the Sticky Fingaz everything I touch I take
So don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry
All that frustration starts to change me
Then I SCREAM! So my voice gets horse
It's time to face the music, and the Red Cross
You can fool some of the people some of the time
The beat is the heart and the words get the mind
I'm livin proof there's no hope of mankind

The place is where (here), and now is the time
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

[Sticky Fingaz]
Every ten years, they unleash phat sound
Well it's time for Sticky Fingaz, God's gift to the underground
For cryin out loud, it's enough you're makin sick and I
wants revenge can I die for my music?
You don't understand, I worship hardcore
They never shoulda let me get my boot in the door
And if you think that's a bluff, then you got me all wrong son
Gettin phat like this is easier said than done
Raise up, rise and shine!
I woke up on wrong side of the bed this time
Now it's time to get phat, 'N' all of DAT!!
(The phat rap scripts tips scales go longer than endless trials
 Play my part, stay sharp as darts and nails)
AHHH shut the hell up (chill) and don't hold me back, black
I'm ?? my own freestyle I'm ready to rip the track
Onyx is back, so phat we need slim fast
(With the boom, check the boom, check the boom body bash!!)

Sacrifice the virgin, urban I'm splurgin
Split splice, I prefer to bring it like a surgeon right

Drilled through ya ear drum, hell yeah, I'm fearsome!
My equilibrium, is touched with the U.S.G., sickness
Contaminated with slickness!
Filthy nasty grungy, tracks of the wretched
I gotta deflect it, crazy desperate, deception!
Yeahhh, son, keep 'em on the run!
If you wasn't a two, then you musta been the one!
It's not a big case, to erase, who makes it my fate

One day I'ma rule the fuckin world, just mark my word
I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I'll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So in essence it's armageddon, somebody's bound to get robbed!
Watch out! This could be you I believe
Put a gun to your face, it's better to give than recieve!

There's no coppers, to stop us, the pros, our motto

Another brother gettin' paid, and away, it's a stick up
No time to even, take a bath
Strictly cash, tax free quick fast

I got Audi, time to get rowdy
Shiftee, low down gritty and grimy
I guess I gotta find my crimey
Sticky Fingaz, yo that's Sticky Fingaz
Jetted to the ave. in a half of a second
He wasn't at the spot, so the stop I was checkin'
Met him on the way, tucked away was the weapon
Stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move

Single handed me and Mickey barely took a trip to Linden
Picked up some cheeba and some brew and yo what else?
Screamin' ""nothing!""
Now we on the East train back and said ""something!""
Oops, since I stooped, the forty-deuce get loose
Seen three other troopers and they tried to call a truce
One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took, and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose, there was nothin' he could do
So I pulled out the old tape ducted twenty-two
But that was only petty skills, the Philly Freddie
Stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move

Yeah, yeah, hand over the money
Don't get like ""Doc, what's up Doc?""
This is Mugs Bunny and ain't nothing funny, ha, it's a stick up
Sticky got sticky and tricky with the wallet
But this ain't ""El Segundo""
It's just the four, bad, brothers from the ghetto
Stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move, stick 'n' move

We had an option after twelve in the city
Man we gonna roll with some like Nitti
But first we got trips, because the man got geese
Yo mister I just got robbed, have you seen the police?
Nah, none over here, good, so run all your gear
Rolex watch, rings, the Gucci underwear
You might think I'm sorta out of order 
But I'll rob you for a quarter - say whitey's youse a goner
You's a goner want to, call the pork, pig
Ya dig, police, peace!

And nnyyaaa, I gotta seek your betterment
Isaac, slayed, for all my niggaz who got hanged!
{""so throw ya gunz in the..""}
They said ""throw ya gunz"" was negative, I say fuck them!
They the ones who put the guns in the ghetto for destruction
This is depression, deception, killin our own complexion
What we need to do, is point the guns, in the right direction
Now

Two wrongs don't make it right but it damn sure make us even (4x)

Yo it's only gettin worse, I'ma person controvers'
And tell you where I'm from, is the savage redman curse
I'm the illest, the biggest, experiment
What are we getting ?? in a cage in the projects
'cause we the ones that's been in it
They gave us guns and drugs, and watch us bug and rub
Each other out (stop) doin what they love
(now) retaliate, it's time to get big, and bombard
And flip this shit, like fruit of the gods
(they say) we got the animal mentality
Show em the raw reality (if you real) you ain't mad at me
But if you is, so the fuck what?
Me and my peeps, came to claim, the brown man's cut
Which was really ours, this the hour
Better do what I do, fuck those nuclear powers!
They're beat, we gotta form our own crop
Dominate, infiltrate, and feel great til it burns down
And when it burns, it's goin up in blazes
Look at it go, where it shoulda fuckin been
Since the dark ages!!!

Two wrongs don't make it right but it damn sure make us even (8x)

I have a dream, that I must reveal
So I pinch myself to make sure it's real
First we gotta destroy and then rebuild
Even if it mean that I'ma get myself killed
Don't make me no difference, I done wrote my will
And talk about, what they did to us is dumb
What we need to be talkin bout, is what we gonna do to them!
I can be dangerous, the last thing I do
When I start speaking in tongues the holy ghost couldn't save you
So do you want answers?  (yeah I want answers, I want the truth!)
You want the truth?  you couldn't handle the truth!
'cause they got our brains-washed, so we the minority
But when we kill them off we're gonna be the majority (preach on)
See I was raised to fight for what I believe in
I won't forget, can't forget, I'm tryin to get even!
And if nobody speak up, then I'll lead my people
'cause two wrongs don't make it right, but it damn sure make us equal
I'm incitin riots, so let's start the lootin
And whoever enforce the laws I guess we'll just got to shoot them
Cause in this revolution I loathe my enemy
I'm agnostic plus I got no identity
So lovers of life don't keep your hopes up high (why?)
'cause it's just a matter of time before it's your turn to die
But until then, when you stop breathin
It's time to stand up and fight for what you believe in!!!!!

Onyx,"Verse 1:

Nigga you heartless
you ain't heartless
you don't want no part in this
you ain't got it in ya
I'm born to be a sinner
as I move through these evil New York streets
like grease
and some kids get caught up
all up in the crime rate
couldn't hold your nine straight when you was bustin
your whole clip and hittin nothing
your whole block on him, only two niggaz got him
came down fast
with the cash and the product
caught you pants down with ya clothes off

a nigga never knows...a nigga never knows

you got your ryhmes niggas?
bring em-we start that
its concrete combat-where I'm at
a crime covered city
where there's no time for pity
we comin from the village
of the unprivledged
blood soaked bills through murder actions
transactions all illegal
I smell the cheeb like a beagle
evil stalks and lurks
dominate and do worse in my dwelling
niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
(we just) bring to these fellas

[chorus 2X]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

these evil streets...

Verse 2:
Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
drivin some scuffed up ragged down beat up past tims
some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
now I'm thinking its 3 in the a.m.
I'm walking and he in a BM
drop top 3-he don't even see me
would you believe, he saw my gun in 3D
10 blocks later trying to work the cd
spotted 15 on the BQE
cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin me
and up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue
my man'll toss the pistol
and of course I hit you
let that loss be with you
the more L's the higher
streets are fire
make ice hearts in men
for worldly desire
its the black attack
born on the corner
nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
and he do anything to achieve it (better believe it)
grew up in a band of thieves
who retrieves the goods
stacking stacks
and pushing niggas shit back like they should
while we was gone
some shit undeveloped
now parlay, sit back
and watch armys swell up
yeah....punk niggaz

[chorus x4]
As we move through these evil streets...

Verse 3:

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
but when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
a nigga without a gun is like something is missing
that was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
(so listen) keep a gun, even if its not needed
better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose
nigga, we kill niggaz
for Polo and Hilfigers
its all for real ill niggaz
and steel figures
ain't nothin over here
won't be soft
shit be jumping off
on the rag
don't beat me in the head with that
go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
rip out sombodys grandmother
pulled out, the bitch ran for cover
keep niggaz guessin with our face without expressions
for niggaz stressin
I leave a lifetime impression
it shines like aggression when the flame comes out
saw the bout, what you got, when your gang runs out
shits hot, you could get burned with heat
we take turns to sleep
you better learn the street
knowledge
damn, you could get shot for 5 dollars
its live wires
with no signs of survivors...

I burn you like floor sex, you just a small threat
Wit a small set, so forfeit, I rhyme for more checks
'Cause whatever that it takes to make these papes, I`ma walk this
I`m worthless, I`m back to sellin' cracks behind the trenches

Get up, nigga you should of got up
Obey my orders, 'cause shit like that`ll leave you shot up

Look like tacky, attack me, you get splashed
Official nasty backwards, sue, what the fuck is rule, you dumb ass
Trynna put shit on our name, you gonna get numb fast

While I haul off and snatch four shit out ya
Look and see my image again when you start hemorrhaging
And damn, it`s cloggin up, the blood he didn`t smell

And it`s all out war, niggas fall out
For reasons that`s now unknown, check this shit
I got the illest, the realest, hard for kids to kill us
Until it`s, my turn to fall, I`ma bill this

Rugged and raw, pretty 'cause I`m hardcore
All Mighty then Thor, always ain`t it for a faggot jaw
So hard rocks and fillin' flocks, clear the block
My mic`s a glock, I keep plenty styles in stock
The way emcees react when I attack
Get me away from him, he`s a maniac

It`s pure you see, I bring fame
They call me Nigga so much, startin' to think it`s my name
Light skinned and a shame, 'cause way back in the day
They rapped my grandmother`s mother`s, when they was in Spain
To help my grandfather, he be misbehaved
But my ancestors was brave, and most of them real
Stronghold brass, forty slain workin' in the field
But a hundred years later, I learned about my roots
And how they traded in there white sheets, for badges and blue suits
So I`m takin 'recruits, and shut the fuck, it`s on right
And start a fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
And if a nigga don`t win, then we all jump in

Even my man got killed, that was families mournin
But from all the dirty bid, I know that hell is callin
Went to his wake and shit got held up
But niggas wit mask on they face
I couldn't escape, I was stuck
They said ""Everybody in here, up against the wall
The dead nigga owe me money, so I'll collect from y'all""
The people gave him struggle, 5 minutes went fast

But first da cut-- Then I bust they verse to quince(?) my fears

[Sticky Fingaz]

I've had mad money, but I spend it, now I'm broke
So I'm searching for somebody to put in a choke hold
And I can wet to wrap my bay hands around they neck
And SQUEEZE until I fuckin' strangle 'em to death

[Sonsee]

Yo, you smell that?

[Fredro Starr]

Yeah, that's me, I'm the shit
I'm in affect like Woodtex
A newer Tec from out da click
Because my rhyme again, pass me my Heineken
WHERE'S THE WEED I NEED? It is my vitamin, so light it Lincoln (HAH!)
Reach for the sky, you move too far, you won't get by, you gotta jar
This style is a gimmick and you know that you can't be, what we be
We AFFICIAL NAST!

[Chorus]

[Fredro Starr]

When I was born, I never thought that I could be like that
? up on their BACK, block's sellin' CRACK
Watch the BLACK cops, I PACK cock clocks and glock phat knots
Nigga in Dawn Paddy crimes, like I play nines
And odds to stay alive, survive and they gettin' mine
Faultless for ghetto minds, and FUCK DA ???
See you rather run the streets and fuck around with the crooks
THEY GOT bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and Deffer and better
This my better bottom of brother, word to mother!

[Sonsee]

Mo' niggaz grab the mics, talkin' 'bout they gonna set it
When all the rounds you'll make is fake and synthesis
We just get it, wish your style is old and ?
So burn up mo' money, 'cause you gets no credit
You want it? Here go
Nigga know that you own me, or me gon' be on da street dealo
Bangin' M.C.'s, SO KEEP IT LIVE! Up in here
I swear nothing left, we pose dead, your best record by--Most def, Most Def

[Sticky Fingaz]

Sticky Fingaz, I earn money for walkin' in chains
Where I grew up, in Brooklyn New York, moved to Queens, and my teams
My pants is bustin' out the scene, is what this gun in my teens
Without it I wouldn't've lived this long
In my wildest dreams, that I'm a STAR!
All spotlights, police have me!

Even my man got killed, now his family's mournin 
but from all the dirt he did I know that, hell is callin 
Went to his wake and shit got held up

They said ""Everybody in here, up against the wall 
That dead nigga owe me money so I'm collectin from y'all"" 
The people gave him struggle, five minutes went fast 
When I said ""I ain't givin y'all niggas shit, I'ma just have to get

I just wanna get high & live it up
So fuck a 9 to 5 and whitey tryin to slave us, with minimum wages
Slamming my niggas up in cages
Changin their behavior to spitting razors, that's outrageous
Smoking roaches is hopeless, we want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffeurs who fuck us, full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush, it's that afficial nast
Got bitches with pistols and cash, we living in the last
My theory is ""fuck it"", sexy niggas get abducted
My corrupted is conducted, through ghettos, sipping amaretto
Hand on the metal, foot on the pedal
He wore carolina herrera, dirty donna karan sweaters
Ralph lauren leathers and suedes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up; I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners, busting shots at time-warner's

My man big ty, he know how to get by
Get high, do a jix, then be fixed to be fly
Some mid, cross and up and downtown action
And when he stick he keep a grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibis, a plan to stay wise and wide eyed
Living in the state of south side
Crooked jakes and fakes snake niggas all out for papes
All who wanna over take you leave them with drapes
The white sheet covers, this heat smothers
The street, eat brothers
Six shots rang, duke got banged
We all ready for these wars
We all want more, these the last days get yours

32 shots inserted in glocks, you heard it for blocks
The murderer who gots convertible drops
Livin life on the edge, a dangerous way of living
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
Cause it be off the hook
Crooks, crack
Cheeba spots, and selling rocks
The cops around the clock
It’s hot
Livin life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it

Thinkin about takin my own life
I might as well, ‘cept they might not sell weed in hell
And that’s where i’m goin cause the devil’s inside of me
He make me rob from my own nationality
That’s kind of ignorant, but yo I gotta pay the rent
So yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite
A degenerate if I get caught I'm innocent
Cause I don't leave no sticky finga prints
For the cops, they only good if they dead
And all that badge and the gun shit be goin’ to their head
To make bread I gotta steal for sport
So I stole the show and made some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fucking rap shit don't pay
I'ma start selling drugs around my way
Killing my own people in the usg
Shit they gonna get it from somebody, I'd rather it be me
Besides, you can't tax dirty money
And you can't trust nobody (nobody)
No one (no one), I'm a scorpion
And I'll probably bite the bullet cause I live by the gun

Big heavy hitters, 25 to life bidders who just came out and pullin flame out
Take aim
Blow your brains out
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
In south suicide queens where niggas act up
Nigga back up
A hundred mag throw your fucking gats up

Onyx,"A lot of things have changed since I grown up 
Half my brothaz got locked half got blown UP! 
From playin' '2 hands touch' and the games in the street 
But the games ain't the same now we playin' with heat 
See this danger! In my building they're rollin' dice there 
Ain't nuthin' nice there who dare with ice there?! 
My hallway ain't right wrong way to the thugs in the doorway 
Peace kid I'm out, no doubt! We just hangin' on the corner 
Puffin' trees as tryin' to stay warm, sippin' ??? Jezus! 
Problems after problem, it keeps involvin' 
They got us starvin', that's why we out rottin' 
(Knah'm sayin'?) 
These days I can't remember like the 6th of December 
I think it was September nah, maybe it was November (what?!) 
This kid got rocked, just was steppin' on some sneakers 
Heard from Tamica, he's gettin' buried in a speaker 
'cause his mom's was on that *inhaling*, gettin' laced 
She got SMOKIN' IT! She took one bad hit

Aiyyo (Yo!), you can't escape the ghetto 
Hell no, it's everywhere you go 
Aiyyo (Yo!), you can't escape the ghetto 
Hell no, it's everywhere you go 
Aiyyo (Yo!), you can't escape the ghetto 
Hell no, it's everywhere you go 
Aiyyo (Yo Yo!), you can't escape the ghetto 
Hell no, it's everywhere you go 

I'm not your role model, I drink the whole bottle 
don't' follow nobody, 'cause you'll never know tomorrow 
Just look around, everywhere, it's dispersed 
It ain't no care, hate, and good times is rare 
Or seldom last long, they always fade it 
With my fam is dyin' over money and gettin' incarcerated 
Yeah! Just to be as patistic, it's sadistic 
Too realistic, we doin' this quick! 
The other night kids got bad, got 'em kids build intend 
They caught a law's news spread(?) 
Last week they was blazin' on the corner, bullets ricochet 
It's somebody's baby, had they kid maybe dead 
They sold it from the ???, they say delease 
Livin' in the ghetto, rest in peace 

Hates where I'm from, the good tie up 
The sky is grey, we never see sun 
The ghetto-life is: 'live and let live' 
All the day to day 

It all began when Shorty rocked, took the law in his own hand 
Sick of seein' his mom's gettin' beat up by his old man 
So he did what any kid would've done 
Went into the closet, got his pop's gun 
Who need enemy when you got family? 
It's hard to get a job when you look like me (word up!) 
See people don't just rob 'cause they all unemployment 
Some do it for the pure satisfaction enjoyment 
Brrrr, it's cold, this world is freezin' 
Folks get murdered over no-pair raisin'(no!) 
Packin' they backs, talkin' 'bout they leavin' 
But where ya gonna go? You can't escape the ghetto! 
You see more when you high, even less when you low 
You can't run from your own ??? home

Onyx,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man

Fuck a brain fry, make me think irrational

I'm too raw; what is you - out you gourd?
I cut through any challenger, top notch or amateur
You'd rather be in the projects butt-ass with a hundred G's cash
and no gun, than to fuck with Sticky, Fredro 'n Son
You lookin at one desperate nigga, you shouldn't mess with
I had a doctor scared to remove a bullet from yo' intestine
'Member when I tested, this nigga manhood
to see if he was a true nigga, so I pulled out my gun
Gave some dramatic ass speech then, pulled the trigger

Roll on the stolen V's with he-ho chase you
Cop a six more time, and 3 years probation
We be offender, bender, no retreat, no surrender
I'm the number one contender
I got a new game plan, strictly sportin name brand
Layin in the pound hunted, footin through your town blunted
On some shit that get you burnt throats
Amputated all the turn coats, and get cremated
Never been B-rated, my 5 plated, is how I get fights
I have your family driving in the daytime wit they head lights

I'm daily thinkin of a life gleamin
That life we in, how to obtain, and what's the meanin
The fact that cash rules, these last days
We the last crews, my present wars and my past rules
True soldier, no matter the goal
We gettin closer, for bitch ass niggas, it's just about over
I'm in it for the long haul, this goes out
To all my true livin dogs and my SOHO

Don't talk about it, make it happ'
Don't fake it chap
The hennecy act, got you light gat
You wanna block, try to hold nine
Son you livin on my time, don't try to Overshine
Play your p, play your position
I stay with G, stay on a mission
Precisely, good, wit game, I'm nicely
Shifftee son, still shiesty
You in your eight fifty, ridin shotgun
If you can count your money, you ain't got none
And bitches beat they game tight
Baby, get the name right, see G. comin, like a train light
And niggas be don pretending
But I'm armed and bendin, so they can get the John Lennon
Hundred dollar gator players
Silk shirts and champagne, don't know a thing about the damn game

With AlphaStation of lyric lacin, for all occasions
Engagements and events, for big dollars and cents
Makin niggas past tense, it's consequence
All I see around me, makes up the place
But if you don't hold down your space, you quickly get erased
Don't waste, a thought, thinkin
I ain't gon' be bringin the guns that grants hole
To my body, dead and stinkin
Watch as I back draft, on the last glass, and trap crash
Catch the hash blast, when I puff the black wrath
Learn the tricks of the trade, to be self made

You know what we fin' to do
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down

It's time to take over the world!

Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
(Official Nast', I'm tired of these yo, yo, yo)

Shut 'em down start the violence we whylin' whylin'
Slain rapper's body found washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up this nigga heart slowed up, that killa froze up
When I pulled up, jumped out with the pump-pump 32 shots and ducked out

Then I broke out, left that cat for dead his body smoked out
'Cause when I fall out, y'all killas got kill me kid I'm goin' all out
Life's a bitch, fuck it!  Got a gun, bust it!
The gameplay, gotta play by the rules of your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest

Have you layin' where the dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes of death
Asked the Lord for forgiveness
When I did this, there was not no witness
But he should understand 'cause even God got a shit list

Yo it's beatdowns anonymous, I spits like a shiny silver nine'll bust
Niggaz fine to bust, we the kind that rush
Those that hold back taking your whole stack
Grimy street cats, niggaz baldhead, like Kojak

Go gat for gat, quote that, in fact you can smoke that
Uncut black dust, making your whole fucking skull crack
Better know me, one-three, one and only
Could be never phony in any ceremony, I'll tear you homey
(Shut 'em down!)

Sonsee's taking your time, making your mind
Baddest nigga on the low defecatin' with rhymes
Breakin' your spine, got you movin' from the flurry time to worry
I'ma bury the bullshit, feel my full clip!

Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down

Aiyyo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel'll blast his face
Be on the lookout for a basketcase
Niggaz pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shit is sweet

Now you up shit's creek 'cause your shit's weak
How much is your life worth to someone important? 'Cause I be extortin'
Kidnappin' for ransom is some shit that you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon niggaz was gettin' robbed

The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job with his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon?
Worth makin' my shit go boom [Incomprehensible] your own doom?
Fill them graveyards 'til there's no room?

Fuck you know about a pine box? Money goin' out with nine glocks
On top between that same nigga when they pull out spray nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew? I ain't gon' rest
It don't take a whole lot to fill up your vest

Then watch your lungs as they spill out your chest
You best get on some, act your age shit
You a little kid that run for faces
More niggas get killed like that than a little bit

Ay man Sticky
F I N G A Z the crazy Cajun blazin' bullets for days and days
And grazin' amazin', I'm the guy that's lacin'
Purple Hazin, hard to be phasin', Lord, all this hell that I'm raisin'

We turn shit dumb quick when the gun click
Lyin' incubine pursed and lyin' on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs I'm the Rottweiler my glock holla
Fuck cocaine killa I sniff gunpowder

So all you real Willies throw your Roley's in the sky

Ay yo Stick man, shit is fucked up!
(Who the fuck this?)
It's fuckin Fredro man!
(Yo yo yo, turn the muthafuckin music down god.)
It's my fuckin word, Sticky, man!
(Yo what's up nigga?)
Muthafuckas wetted everything out there.
(What the fuck you talkin about?)
Muthafuckas is dead, son!
(Yo yo, calm down nigga, calm down!)
Word to fuckin mother man!
(Just tell me what happened, god.)
It had to be about eight o'clock (Uh huh, uh huh)
When niggas sprayed the block, it's mad hot
Yo half the spot got locked
(What? Who got shot?)
My little nigga Bill from down the hill
We had a one through five
I heard he might not survive (Aw, damn)
He caught one in his leg
Two shots hit him in his upper (What?)
Part of his chest, two inches above his vest
Heard you next (I'm next?)
That's the word in the projects
(What? Them niggas ain't no threat
 They'll whole set'll get wet
 Yo go get the AK, and my two nines with the silencers
 And at seven thirty, y'all niggaz meet me at Veronica's)
Aight, no doubt, yo be safe, yo nigga I'm out
{Let me talk to him, let me talk to him}
Yo yo Stick hold up, yo yo yo Stick, talk to Son
(Aight, aight) Don't even wet that done, yo I'm bringin mad guns
{Ay yo Stick, that's my word
 It might be them niggas from Riverside
 'cause I heard they knew somethin
 About how my little nigga died}
(Who who, little Dave with the red car?)
{Yeah, he had beef up there
 With the same ones we seen at the strip arcade
 With the scar by his head}
(Aight aight, get the big shit, no bullshit, it's time to flip
 And I'll see y'all niggas later, be safe)
{No doubt, aight kid}

Then they jumped in the Expo
Aiyyo Son slow down, we got mad techs yo
Fuck that I'm vexed yo!
Yeah I know, I know but chill, let alone and chill
We meet the gods so we can bill on these niggas for real

It was a half an hour drive 'fore they finally arrive
Veronica came to the door, she smiled and said

[Veronica]
Hi, hi! Step inside, get out the rain get dry
Sticky's in the back playing pool by the sauna

[Fredro Starr (Sticky Fingaz) {Sonsee} *Veronica*]
We stepped in the back all I smelled was marijuana
(Yo what's up?) Yo nigga what's up
(You know I don't give a fuck
 Them niggas time's up
 You got them two nines or what?)
No doubt, I bought it all out
{Kid I'm ready to go to war!}
(Ay yo yo yo, chill let's play it smart
 And catch em by surprise
 We'll do it on the ninjas
 In the mornin before the sunrise
 Ay yo Veronica, *Yes?* yo gimme some beers
 And cook me some food, I'm starvin)
 *Ok, alright darlin*
Yo Stick, what's up with this bitch?
(I'm startin to like this chick)
Yo she a bad bitch
{Yeah, plus her dad is rich}
(Yo fuck it, rack it up

 Nine ball)
Yeah aight, put your money where your mouth is
Winner take all
{Ay yo, I got next, pass me a Beck's and a philly
 'cause this L we bout to puff is for my nigga Billy}

A hour passed
 
*Dinner's ready* What's to eat?
*I made spaghetti in clam sauce*
(See? She know I'm the damn boss)
*I'ma go upstairs and lay down
 You guys enjoy your meal*
{Yo how many rooms this spot got? This crib is ill}
Ay yo this food is slammin, god
She cook like she black
(Yeah, and after this I'ma go upstairs and tear out her back)

*It's me, Veronica. Yeah they're all here right now
 Ok, alright*
(Veronica? *Huh?* Who was that?)
*Oh, oh just my dad*
(C'mere my little freak dog, why you lookin so sad?
 You want daddy to cheer you up?
 You know you like when I spank you
 So bend over by the bedpost and grab your ankles)
 
(After three nut, then fell the fuck out
 'cause in the mornin gotta take care of this be	-i
 No doubt)

Wake up motherfuckers!

[Fredro Starr]
Oh shit! What did I see?
Five niggas pointin guns at me (.?.) and Sonsee
*Fuck that! Shut the fuck up!
 Nigga get the fuck on the floor!*
Hit me dead in the jaw
With the chrome four four

[Sticky Fingaz]
Woke up the next mornin, couldn't hardly sleep last night
Oh shit my two nines is missin, wait somethin ain't right
Where the fuck that bitch go? Damn that hoe!
Wait, I know, that bitch in the kitchen praly makin me something to eat 
But still wearin my heat
Fuck it I'ma wake these niggas up so we can go hit the street
I went downstairs, couldn't believe my eyes
I seen Veronica with three guys twice my size
They all had guns but I was gatless
Last thing I saw was the kid with the scar
And then I seen blackness
Remember thinkin, how the fuck they know?
Oh, Veronica

Oh, Veronica, Veronica

You want to bang nigga bang, fucking bang your set
want to play gun rap, I'll arrange ya death
My tech disconnect
Arms, legs, necks from chest
Shots split you
Rip through tissue
Raps most dangerous, ravenous
I'll leave the booth covered with remains of shit
Put the four-five blitz on the dot six range
Ice your frame and hang ya banger by his chain
This is Crip talk, Blood New York
Blow ya brains in your hand, nigga hold that thought
From outta the dark
Niggas get money from gat dealin'
Dead rappers body get found in back of buildings
We started this shit
We the heart of this shit
Onyx motherfucker, hard as it get
We at war so wha-what
Get your arms up
Nigga front, get your whole projects barked up

I got a million niggas, cockin nines
You don't know us kid, you better hide your shine
And if you see a nigga with jewels on his neck
Stick em up, Stick em up, Stick em up
Back on the scene, gun with the beam
All you see is white, turn you red for the green
Niggas better move, Onyx coming through
Every track I'm on I turn black and blue
I can't, come from the head, I come from the heart
I shit hip-hop, nigga wipe my ass with the source
Ain't no nigga dead or alive fuckin with this
Need a second opinion? Ask your bitch
Walk through NYC to CPT
We 'bout blow up again like WTC
I changed the Benz sign to a crucifix
Onyx pull up with three 6's like six, six, six

BLAOW! Techs up cause we bust rowd'
Shoot through your door
Watch bodies lift off the floor
Runnin' up the steps with a 100 shots gunnin'

My team built strong like steal bars in prison
twenty five to life, my brothers in hell biddin'
We bang on the charts, send flames to the top

Aiyyo, set it off, let it off, get it off
Get this shit wild like thugs from up north
Fights in the crowd, the shots'll jump off
Body's on the floor, blood on the dance floor
Get stuck at the bar, get robbed at the door
Dropped off at the coat tag door, take it off
Get down, face down to the ground
Kill 'em for their doe like Po from uptown
Cut your finger off, send it to your moms house
Never testify no matter how it goes down
When I bark shots you niggas'll duck down
Run up on your block, you niggas get shut down
Give it up, you don't want to try to resist
Before I hit you off, you don't want to die for this
Un-unh, so we gon load our guns to this
Black mask, face down, motherfuckers gettin robbed to this

[Chorus 2x]
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
One gun, two gun, three to the head

Shots'll spill, niggas think it's not for real 
Make your body disappear like Copperfield
At the funeral's, don't waste no doctor bills
A lot of niggas ain't kickin shit I can feel
We gettin it down real big, that's what we doin
Give 'em the most raw, that's what we doin
The game don't understand, the world don't understand
These niggas is gun in hand, you die for these grand
Shot's from the magnum, killin the gats, smack 'em
You got it back, stab ya, with your own dagger
My sons take your 6, rope you in the closet (Hot one's!)
The one's that probably even pump the cops up
We got 'em strung with the drugs that we dealing
Or peeling, some loud niggas, thugs can feel us
And my Brooklyn killers, and my project niggas
And my brother's locked down in the jails can feel it

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
If I don't eat, fuck that everybody starve
Takin your plate like it's food time in Oz
Motherfucker, I kidnap all your kids
Before I had a record deal, what you thought I did?
Last job I had I was punching a clock
Last nigga that I tied up was up at Koch
I ain't even need a mask, I ain't bust one shot
Made 'em wire me my money right there in the spot
That's a Coneay watch, nigga take that off
That's a iced out cross, boy take that off
Know what'd happen to your daughter if I don't make that call?
Better take me to the bank and get your face plucked off
Hottest nigga in the club cause I got the heat
So run boy, run boy, one gun box with me?
So step up young'n, show me you gon do
We got big guns nigga that go ""boom boom boom!""

Just to let you know this is recorded 9/11/2001
The day the World Trade Center blows up
Shit is real, son
Shit hit home, kid, word up
Hope you can feel this

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
(Hope you can feel me)
So much pain insii-ii-iide
Hope you can hear me
I'm crying through my heart

[Fredro Starr]
When I first heard the track it made me cry
Brought tears to my eyes and I don't even know why
My life ain't nothing but anger and pain
Tatoos on the back of my arm should explain
Blood, sweat and tears, ten years in the game
So many times all alone with the gat to my brain
It's me against the world nigga, I feel the same
I'm ""Ready to Die"" too Big, I feel the same
I'm America's nightmare - young, black and rich
Man, I'm paranoid, make me want to clap my bitch
A hundred miles an hour, want to rap my whip
Asking God ""Shit, where we going after this?""
I'ma thug, a thug til heart be stop
Til they pick me off the street nigga, murdered a shot
My wars, my words, the only thing that I got
And I live by the gun and I die by the glock
16 shots, fuck that I'm takin them all
I'd rather die on my feet then live and crawl
My gun got powers like the 48 Lords
The ""Ghetto Superstar"" die see my face on the wall, and don't forget me

[Chorus]

[Sonsee]
Growing up in Brooklyn, times was rough cuz...
Poor as we was it couldn't get no tougher
On my ave. most of us was not blood
But as kids we shared that block love
But that faded, when my brother's got arrested
They thugged on the block to hard, we was ejected
To the creator - was it you that made moms pick Queens?
So her baby son could race the world, when he created things?
Why her elders always heard the sounds of sirens?
Plus they ignored the divine guidance
Why was the time I was born 9/16?
Turn it upside down it's the same thing
Why do I have a M-16, and the 9?
Will I have to go out, blazing one at a time?
When you took moms baby carriage, in the early stage
Was he too ill for this world, and you made a mistake?
Did he come back ask me, to do something great?
To keep the fam strong and straight, help my brother's escape?
And have baby sis and us, living on an estate
Do it big, or die trying - is that my fate?

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
Who really cares, what the world think about me?
If I die right now, is you coming with me?
When I'm broke, who the hell got money for me?
Can't even trust half the team running with me
I only know three people that'd kill for me
Break the sixth commandment, make blood spill for me
Life and death - the only thing that's real for me
'cause I was born into the world with a guilty plea
Now shit hit the fan, is you ridin with me?
When the whole world watching, all eyes on me
Swear on a stack of Bibles, testify for me
Look the judge dead in the face and lie for me
If I go to prison, who gon do my time for me?
Start the revolution, get the chair, fry with me
Go out in a blaze of glory, guns to the sky with me
I'm all alone in this world, all I got is me

[Chorus 3x]

Hope you can feel me...",Feel Me,2002
Onyx,"You my wife with no papers
My gangsta bitch
The first time I got caught
You to shank the bitch

Ain't scared to get down
She'll bust off rounds
Smoke a Newport
Cut me half, bust me down

Catch me looking at anotha chick
She curse me out
Dead serious
But at times she act silly

Jump out the truck at the light
To get the dutch
Rolling it up
Chasing down ice cream trucks

I waited half an hour for your hair to get braided
She leaving dirty messages on three way pagers
Thought her how to roll cello and spit razors
She hit triple six first time out in Vegas

She never got shook when the Feds
Knocked down the door
She hid the coke
A scared chic would of flushed it raw

And we could live it up
Eat lobster and shrimp
Or get grimy with a
Quarter bag of potato chips

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta
(Straight gangsta)
Gangsta

I need a down chic
That wouldn't mind loading the clip
And that wouldn't blow her mind
If I showed her a brick

In and outta the grind
With a focus for chips
Blowing for one time
With her controlling the weep

Re-up for me
And make sure she double the flip
She a sophisticated thug bitch
That move her hips

She catch you for your setup
When you move ya shit
But most of the time she throw
The cold shoulders to guys

Smoke in the ride
Hooded low
Over her eyes
She know she a dime

Baby nine strapped to her thighs
Gotta be live
Help me count doe in a five
And when I'm gone for weeks on them O.T. moves

She don't trip
She's a gangsta
She knows the rules
Giving me hell

That's not something I am hoping to loose
And God forbid, I slip up and land in jail
My murda mommy put the house up
To make the bail
(Come on)

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta
(Straight gangsta)
Gangsta

Behind a real nigga
Is a real bitch
They lied to me
See my bitch

She walk right beside of me
I been in situations
Seen her ride for me
She lick my gun wounds

Even did my time with me
Ain't nothing she can't have
I get that girl everything
Tatoo our names on our fingers for wedding rings

Are you that chic?
Do you rep sticky?
We split it down the middle everything
Forty, sixty

Are you that chic for rich
Or poor?
The only one I eat out
The only one I hit raw

Keep you covered in ice
'Til you start shiverin'
Baby phat Gucci
Thugged out in pink timberlands

Me and her, we like Bonnie and Clyde
I hold the heat and the money and
She drive the ride
She make other bitches mad

'cause she more bitch
Than they ever been
It's the beautiful, intelligent
Talented, trama, heroin

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta
(Straight gangsta)

Count bills with me
You'll kill for me
When the blood shed tears
You still with me

'cause you real with me
Smoke five with me

Scared of dropping their bars

I make ya new, Money better play it low
Take it slow, Make the foo
Keep ya face ain't a moo
I'm like mixin' liquor
I'm bound to come up on niggaz
And hijack the bank abduct ya ditches
Can't fly, got a nice plan tuck to fit ya
I'll be lost a fare kid paid bucks to bitch ya
So, no, we're stopping we're trempin' yo scene
I'm mixin', yellow with blue, I gotta get green
Either yo with us, or not, not in between
You will show us the money when I show you the bean

[Chorus:]

Well it's the S-T crocked I-see-K-why
Got ma ?? ?? doin' for sticks back in be  (?), K and why
I'm livin' all in five barrels, so I'm rappin' wild
The thuggest thug in the club, who else plays high?
Been in the game for years, it made me a criminal
Your small time, my rims is just as big as you
Iv never had a nine to five, I had a nine that hit people that got off there five
From those shiny things, that cut trough glass
Don't even speak to me, this is about sex and cash
I like ma cars, girls and clothes only for ma models
I beat you between yo head with thousand dollar arms bottle
Can't even with ice, I carry to much heat
The combination always leaves somebody wetting the street
I'm start sellin' hope trough ma arms of weed
'Cause I'm broke, only got three hundred grand on the bank
We back, bringing you that filth from filth
Let me stop talking before I criminate myself

You want to know the truth? Take a look in my eye
I'm like B.I.G.'s first album, I'm ""Ready to Die""
It's Sticky Fingaz, if you didn't already know who I am
The minute I reached out and touched the whole hood with no hands
Cause in the streets I live through it, it's more than music
Whatever I'm spittin' on, I put my life into it
Got a reputation on the streets of keepin' it rough
There's just too many of us, you get rushed, you get bust - what!
Big trucks, chrome rims spinnin'
The mad faced niggas got money so now we grinnin'
Pull your sticks out, we the group you listen to, kid!
Niggas told me my music helped em' through they bid
I'm the voice of the ghetto, the heart of New York
A fiend will give his last hit, just to hear me talk
Niggas paid for their mistakes, death is the price
That's right motherfucka, Onyx for life!

Hold up, this is for my thugs on the block
For my one stop niggaz that be huggin the spot
Sittin' on crates, gettin' loaded, get that cake
Dodgin' drinks, spit and hafta cover they face

Kick some tye, big truck with tricks inside
In too deep, tryna sell bricks from the side
See no games, with real niggaz from other hoods
Car titles get lost, some niggaz get jooked

But God forgive me if a nigga cross the fam
Holdin the heat, the streets'll make me force ya hand
From my wild crew, sets the new guns off the roof
To them slick dudes, hot and they workin the phone booth

'Cause Lord knows I'm gonna reload and bust back
Incredible gats, indicted for a federal rap
They ain't duck low enough, shots shredded they hat
Murdered and gone, nigga it's a medical fact

All my bus stop bitches that be pushin them drops
Playin' the gate, get it ma, get those papes
Hustle that face, seven G's below ya waist

Project chick, dippin whips, cruisin the strip
Gettin money for tuition, go to school and she strip
Kill in the club, when niggaz dicks get hard
Murda mami set you up and niggaz bricks get robbed

Help her soul if a chick try to set my team
I'm tying her up, rep till the death of Queens
All my staircase niggaz keep flippin the jun's
All my outta state niggaz keep gettin them ones

Guns in the air, hit you with invisible glocks

Catch a rat nigga, leave his Bentley sittin on bricks
Bloody ice-pick fights in the yard
Ten times outta ten, step to me and ya life get scarred

Shoot-outs in broad daylight, bustin at feds
Dirty cops with a ki of coke, bring 'em out dead
For my jail niggaz, stashin bangers deep in they cots
For my grimy niggaz, hidin under cars from cops

Various styles, crossin like Darius Miles
Lockin it down, the game got me leery to smile
Movin too slow, gettin tired, pick up the flow
Passin go, two bricks to get in the goal
Pushin that weight, front line like Michigan State
Jail board, punk players gettin bumps on their face
The strong survive, shorty want to jump in the ride
Lovin my life, that's why I gotta spit it through mics
Halftime, smoke break, I need somethin to light
Game over, niggaz goin home losers tonight

Call me the first draft pick of this rap shit
Runnin the block like a runnin back duckin from d's
Get knocked on the fifty yard line with hard time
Side lines flooded with drops, cops is the ref
New York is like a contact sport, we play to the death
Money to floss, hos play off a nigga cost
Only rollin with the winners, not the team that lost
The game is wild, I'm like Ray Louis on trial
Flagrant fouls, hit with techs in the fort down
Connects get intercept for their coke in the first round
Be the game most rival thug, rhyme on thug
Blowin ya amps, Onyx is the Eastcoast champs

It's Sticky Fingaz, holla, let me know you heard me
My team dirty, scuffed up timbs and black jerseys
Bulletproof pads, face masks and no mercy
Cooler full of henny and sprite for when I'm thirsty
I'm a sore loser, toughened up, learn to win
If a clip hold a hundred I'll put a hundred and ten
The game face bald head niggaz done it again
Celebratin, takin pictures out in front of the benz
And still we remain the champions
In dirty escalades, tinted up with fancy rims
And still we do the shit that can't be done
Every word that come out my mouth is an anthem

[Chorus]",Champions,2003
Onyx,"Nigga you heartless, you ain't heartless
You don't want no part in this, you ain't got it in ya
I'm born to be a sinner
As I move through these evil New York streets
Like grease and some kids get caught up
All up in the crime rate
Couldn't hold your nine straight when you was bustin'
Your whole clip and hittin' nothing

Your whole block on him, only two niggaz got him
Came down fast
With the cash and the product
Caught you pants down with ya clothes off

A nigga never knows
A nigga never knows

You got your rhymes niggas? Bring 'em, we start that
It's concrete combat, where I'm at a crime covered city
Where there's no time for pity, we comin' from the village
Of the unpriviledged, blood soaked bills through murder actions
Transactions all illegal, I smell the cheeb like a beagle
Evil stalks and lurks, dominate and do worse in my dwelling
Niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
We just bring to these fellas

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us
These evil streets

Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
Drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
Drivin' some scuffed up ragged down beat up past times
Some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
Now I'm thinking it's 3 in the a.m., I'm walking and he in a BM
Drop top 3, he don't even see me
Would you believe, he saw my gun in 3D

10 blocks later trying to work the CD
Spotted 15 on the BQE
'Cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin' me
And up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue, my man'll toss the pistol
And of course I hit you, let that loss be with you
The more L's the higher, streets are fire
Make ice hearts in men, for worldly desire
Its the black attack born on the corner
Nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
And he do anything to achieve it, better believe it
Grew up in a band of thieves who retrieves the goods, stacking stacks

And pushing niggas shit back like they should
While we was gone, some shit undeveloped
Now parlay, sit back and watch armys swell up
Yeah, punk niggaz

As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
But when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
A nigga without a gun is like something is missing
That was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
So listen, keep a gun, even if it's not needed
Better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
Fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose

Nigga, we kill niggaz for Polo and Hilfigers
It's all for real ill niggaz and steel figures
Ain't nothin' over here, won't be soft
Shit be jumping off on the rag
Don't beat me in the head with that, go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
Rip out somebody's grandmother
Pulled out, the bitch ran for cover

Keep niggaz guessin' with our face without expressions
For niggaz stressin', I leave a lifetime impression
It shines like aggression when the flame comes out
Saw the 'bout, what you got, when your gang runs out
Shit's hot, you could get burned with heat
We take turns to sleep, you better learn the street
Knowledge, damn, you could get shot for 5 dollars
It's live wires with no signs of survivors

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us
These evil streets

As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right
Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' alright
For the nugs
Why y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's
With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat
For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down
For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rounds

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Never thought that the cries of my people would get louder
When Chief first came home with that glistenin' white powder
But it gave us power
Never thought them ? packs that had us buyin' clothes and pullin' hoes
Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes
(That's how it goes)
And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights
I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights
Now I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack ?
Flip a new Lac with his work
End up in the back of hearse
Then be packed in the dirt
? over turf, can you hear the Mack when it burst
He get cracked where it hurts
Feel the automatic when it jerks
Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk
Is that what it's worth naw, niggaz got the chrome in ? in the whip
Never let the law get the low on the licks
Bet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks
You ain't on yo P's, you gotta be
Fuck a ? strategy, don't be punked like no lame
You just a Bone in the game
Steady baggin' work, hittin' licks, and stackin' cain'

And bust it open like I'm bout to get burnt in here

These titties perky, I ain't a virgin you ain't gotta worry bout a thing
Just lay back cause I'm on a mission to please
And I got plenty doe whodie so I ain't lookin for cheese

Not tonight I got a quarter pound of that weed
And we can go to the verge, come one put it all in me

For the doe, She'll probably get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
till I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me

And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games

You're jokin' me, you gotta be

To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

I'm sorry I don't understand

Gings dir beschissen fingen wir dich auf 
Und gings dir besser waren wir auch dabei

Wir mussten weiter noch ein Bisschen um die H䵳er ziehen 
Wussten beide 'ne Beziehung ist nicht nur 'ne Idee 
Waren wir zusammen nicht ein Spitzenteam? 
Das haben wir nicht verdient 
Wir haben die Hits geschrieben 

Ich beweis dir dass wir nichts davon von verloren haben 
Wir fangen nochmal ganz vorne an 
Und h? nicht auf was all die Leute reden

Und immer wieder diese Popstar Show 
Bei keinem Anderen war es wieder so 
Wie bei der coolen Band mit Smu-D-O

Doch irgendwie hat irgendwo immer irgendwas gefehlt 

Spielt keine Rolle wieviel Zeit vergeht

Wir rauchten Stacks und Weed und Gras en masse 
Ich habe dich vollgetextet do hast zugeh?
Wir hatten tollen Sex mit allem Zubeh?

Wir kennen uns 'ne halbe Ewigkeit 
Hatten zu jeder Zeit nur wenig Streit 
Nur ab und zu gabs mal ein Bisschen Knatsch 
Bei all dem Klatsch und Tratsch f?t do dich verarscht 

Aber, es war nicht schwer dich wieder rumzukriegen 
Diese vier Jungs sind zum Verlieben 
Scheint als w䲥n wir immer jung geblieben 
Waren nicht sehr verschwiegen aber schwer verschieden 

Mal brauchtest do jemand der 'ne Quittung belegte 
Dir die Welt erkl䲴 oder mit dir Rennen f䨲t 

Mal wolltest do 'nen Bisschen tiefer gehen 
Alternative Ideen zu unserem miesen System 

Oder dir war mal eher so nach Luxusyacht 
Und wir haben durchgemacht I'm coolsten Club der Stadt 

Doch immer trafen wir den richtigen Ton 
Machten dir nie was vor h䴴e sich nicht gelohnt 

Von der Band I'm Land die dir troyer war 
Von der die CD dir nie zu teuer war 

Musik ist Therapie wir sind versteuerbar 
Hey sag mir nochmal do hast 'nen neuen Star

Have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground
And carved their way to where
The wild and rushing river can be found
And like the rains
I have been carried to where the river flows, yeah
My heart is racing, and my feet are weak
As I walk to the edge
I know there is no turning back
Once my feet have left the ledge
And in the rush I hear a voice
That's telling me to take a leap of faith
So here I go

I'm diving in, I'm going deep, in over my head I want to be
Caught in the rush, lost in the flow, in over my head I want to go
The river's deep, the river's wide, the river's water is alive
So sink or swim, I'm diving in

There is a supernatural power
In this mighty river's flow
It can bring the dead to life
And it can fill an empty soul
And give a heart the only thing
Worth living and worth dying for, yeah
But we will never know the awesome power
Of the grace of God
Until we let ourselves get swept away
Into this holy flood
So if you take my hand
We'll close our eyes and count to three
And take the leap of faith

And you ask if I'll be praying for you please
And in keeping with convention
I'll say yes with good intentions
To pray later making mention of your needs
But since we have this moment here at heaven's door
We should start knocking now, what are we waiting for?

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
For the Father above, He is listening with love
And He wants to answer us, so let us pray

So when we feel the Spirit moving
Prompting, prodding and behooving
There is no time to be losing, let us pray
Let the Father hear us saying
What we need to be conveying
Even while this song is playing, let us pray
And just because we say the word, ""Amen""
It doesn't mean this conversation needs to end

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
Let us pray without end and when we finish start again
Like breathing out and breathing in, let us pray

Let us approach the throne of grace with confidence
As our prayers draw us near
To the One who knows our needs
Before we even call His name

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
For the Father above, He is listening with love
And He wants to answer us, so let us pray

Cause my genre's all hack
Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat
And everybody's getting fired
I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired

Shadyac thought of it as art 'til they laughed at it
Rap songs like Steven Wright
Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right

It's like Burn After Reading

And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches

Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner
Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper
Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber
Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre

Opeth,"It was all true
A parlor strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form ""because""
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page

Endlessly, searching night and day

With the calmness of a whisper

I wear a naked soul

It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust

Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare

Until we rejoice in the meadow

And guide me inside your warped labyrinth

Crestfallen still.
Those eyes, empty like a barren well.
It was the only task I would undertake.
To reap the harvest that was mine.
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,
And left me helpless in your embrace.
The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,
Now slowly smoldering to dust.
The celestial touch, from grey to black.
A fathomless void enclosing.
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.

Wandering through April's fire.
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.
I will endure, hide away.
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.
It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.
The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came

And nighttime birds float as black faces.
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.
Unknown and scarred by life...

The luring eyes, you had never seen.
You have nothing more to find.
You have nothing more to loose.
The cold season drifts over the land.

They huddle in the brown corners.
Some would settle for less.
The castles were all empty, asleep.
Long awaiting their king.

And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.",Karma,1998

Long enough for our last breath of life.
You stare at nothing, right through me,
At times resembling the Devil's concubine.

To caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could,
But as we all know by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence,
You are losing yourself.

The soul has lost its flame
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home
So there I was
Within the sobriety of the immortals
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through
The garden sighs, flowers die
The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on
She could not see me through the windows

In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips
Graven face, she said my name
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise
And I cried, I knew she had lied
Her obsession had died, it had died

When can we scream instead of whisper?

Searching my way to perplexion
In crumbling faith I saw her
Bearing her pain in the wilderness
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew",Godhead's Lament,1999
Opeth,"Kept warm by the light of the lantern
Lost sight of everything tonight
My presence blackens their pattern
A pock in the healthy and calm 

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes 

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost 

Dripping sin
Decision in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn 

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross
Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor 

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task
She would be safe and firm
Nothing of this is in vain
Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past",Moonlapse Vertigo,1999
Opeth,"The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays 

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn 

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler 

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise 

Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain nothing is the same 

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no-one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me 

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come 

She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence 

I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance all that was lost
If youÂ´ll bear with me
YouÂ´ll fear of me
YouÂ´d never leave me to
A fate with you",The Moor,1999
Opeth,"Returned from a hibernal dream
Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side
Gone all that would linger 

Ripped from my embrace
Melinda reflected in shafts
Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence 

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath 

Saw here fading, blank stare into me
Clenched fist from the beautiful pain 

Darkness reared its head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum

Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath 

Came with the moon
The wayward in conscious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in laches

Swathed in filth, any would betoken
Starlit shadows on the wall
Finally there to collect me
From the bowels of sin",Serenity Painted Death,1999
Opeth,"Still it came passing by
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
And fooled me with another day
The knocking message called for my life 

Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, my next of kin
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss 

This is forgiveness, so I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and IÂ´m dying
I find trust in hate 

They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life 

Hangman, clutching at his tools
I will come for you 

The noose is tied
Murmur through the crowd
Plunging into anywhere but here

And the last sight I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me",White Cluster,1999

Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,

Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Opeth,"Haunted nights for haleyon days
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking

Opeth,"Ghost of Mother
Lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow
Contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head

Ghost of perdition
Stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship
Called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
""You have to live before you die young""

Holding her down
Channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance
Draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher
Darkness by her side
Spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter
Waits to pull us under
Rose up to it's call
In his arms she'd fall
Mother light received
And a faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
And like marked pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what is clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hoards
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous

Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals
Where the victim is the prey",Ghost of Perdition,2005

""I'll die alone""
I know she was aching

In search for the words to write the missing page

There is nothing we can do

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there is no time for us
Take comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do

Here it comes, our death comes
And in my sleep I can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you",Eternal Rains Will Come,2014
Opeth,"The grave of our youth is up ahead
And life has become a burden
We move in circles of suppressed despair
Waiting for the sun
And turning stones to find evidence
But it hides in the recesses of our hearts

A written decree of our loss
And we carried no faith in the cross
And the cold years are coming
For the victims of a longing

Out through the doors of starvation
And into the rains of damnation
Where the bitter winds are singing
For the victims of a longing

We carried along through squalor
With an inborn need to dominate and possess
It gives birth to an anger inside
And we can't control this
The blood of departure in our tracks
Dripping from our emptying vessels
Your hand reached out to hold mine
But you're grasping melting ice

Asleep in the rain
A child once again
And the ghost in my head
Has forgiven me

Lifted his curse upon me",Faith in Others,2014
Opeth,"You are sleeping unhampered by guilt
Comes the morning you shut down
The devil's breath is a disease on your lips
Reaching out for your loss
You prey on your flock

Seeking out the weaker hearts
With eternity in your grip
And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion
They will eat from your head

With the moon above and the sun below

I can't remember the sun upon my skin
Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within
I'm always waiting for you before I sleep
There is no comfort in the distance that we keep

In a river of grief I am drowning
And your grip is surrounding my heart
Balancing on the edge of failure
And relieved, should I fall
Scattered dust upon my eyes
A winding road taking you nowhere
A winding road taking me home
And my home is my grave

Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say

Voices of despair is a familiar friendship
A society in your head holds the code to destruction

Dying fast
Summer dying fast
And this can't last, as nothing ever lasts
In a forest of flesh
There is a need to sever myself away from happiness

Still no drifting sun
Black upon the earth
Still the air is dry
And the locust wait

There is no help in the wake of our needs
There is no help to dispel the pain
There is no help yet some cling to a phantom
There is no help, only circles on the water

Only circles on the water","Moon Above, Sun Below",2014
Opeth,"Show me a sign of troubles in your heart
Spare me your lies and tell me that you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care

And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away

In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives",River,2014
