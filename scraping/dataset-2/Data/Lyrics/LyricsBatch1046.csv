Stereophonics,"When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone",You'll Never Walk Alone,1997
Stereophonics,"When you think about it,
He's watching every word you say, hey, dazed.
And when he's sussed you out
He calls her up and out she comes and hustles us

Long digging, gone fishing, love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers,
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers,
Met in a church a night to remember,
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered

He watched the lesbian talk,
She kissed and groaped but mostly talked in lust, crushed
He couldn't make the call,
His eyes were gripped on licking tongues,
Enough's enough, failed for once

Long digging, gone fishing, love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers,
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers,
Met in a church a night to remember,
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered

Long digging, gone fishing, love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers,
Met in a church a night to remember,

Place where they first set eyes on each other,
Flew to the sun to start life all over,
Set up a bar and robbed all the locals

Stereophonics,"You're not in business to be popular
It's become so much about personality
I regard the theater as the greatest of all arts form
The most immediate way in which a human being
Can share with another the sense of what appears to be unity

First of all, I choose the great roles
And if none of these come
I choose the ones that pay the rent

It was like unfinished business in my life
Wherever I went people would say
You would have made a great James Bond, yes

Let's face it, postmen do not great movie heroes make
The imagination, the industry
And encourages the free eyes at the door
Do not try to push your way
Through the front gates of the profession

But do your utmost to find an entry
Through the world of theater
There' s the same surge of adrenalin
You get just before the camera roles

We have lost our sense of ritual and ceremony
But we blame the artists for not finding them for us
Actors often behave like children
And so they're taken for children, such is an actors life

Let's face it, postmen do not great movie heroes make
They tramp discontently through the neighborhood
And the only matter of contact with fellow human beings
Tends to be, tends to be
Reading names and addresses off an envelope

There is a great job
There is the same surge of adrenalin
You get just before the camera roles
Okay, if I wasn't an actor, I'd be a secret agent",Postmen Do Not Great Movie Heroes Make,1999

Stereophonics,"You asked me so where have you been
Let me think now let me see
I stood once where Hitlers feet
Had stood when he made his speech
In Nuremberg in thirty eight
When he tried to build the perfect race
He said black man ain't gonna run 
Alongside our perfect sons

There was Dallas too, the library
The place they ended Kennedy
We stood where Oswald took his shot
In my opinion there's a bigger plot
Costner's back and to the left
The picket fence the better bet
Paris came and summer went
The tunnel's now a flower bed

The famous turf that made Jeff Hurst
The vodka stops to quench my thirst
The Golden Gate stroke Alcatraz
And the fat man failed to get us passes
Jimmy's corner in Raging Bull
De Niro's jokes and bottled pills
Elvis tales from Mr Woodward
Any Richard Burton if you could

Tourists stare at tourist stops
One more picture one more God
Another top up for a change
It makes you think, it makes you sane
Talking more about yourself
There's a mirror too, have a check
Cheque's are always passing through
Some depart but a lot come too

You bite your tongue or chew your meat
Sleep or drink or drink to sleep

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

 And change my lonely song to happiness

 Hoping I'll find a rainbow

Yo, Prince Paul
    (""yea"")
Bust that groove

[Daddy-O]
Well my name is Daddy-O, so
Want you to know, what you want us to know
When I'm around, I'm doggin' the show

[Delite]
To pimp ya hand slips, I'm set to rip tits
The Rhyme-a-rator, king and I'm runnin' the ship

[Frukwan]
You niggas should leave, well who's that?
    ""Frukwan!""
I got style and physique, see
Prince Paul, what, what, we know that you got guts
Let 'em know what's up wit the scratch and cut

    (Prince Paul scratches it up)

[Daddy-O]
You got on and on and three steps ahead
Hot butter on, say what, the cornbread
Stet start troopin' wit the rhymes galore
You do the patty duke, til you can't no more
Play after dark, and search to come in
You might bump heads wit some of ya friends
And the D.J., he may blow ya mind
D.J. Prince Paul, is one of a kind

[Delite]
With a little pat, we smack and then shalat
To a monk that hates, spit out the fact
That the crew is not a threat to society
But opportunity to make people feel hot beats
So we deliver the fun, take her way down un'
Make people gather round and shake their bun
And we never leave a jam til the job is done
And if you want to fight that, we could go for some

[Frukwan]
Right to left, you right, he's deaf
Fly girls in the corner, you shootin' ya best
So watch rock the show, so she says no
'cause she see the Prince Paul, cut sparks'll flow
When these cuts are made, it go inside wit the fade
After that's done, that's when we get paid
It's Stet prefect, Prince Paul is direct
And he cut's the old school and that's hi-tech

    (instrumentation)

[Daddy-O]
Dip-dip-dive, so-socialize
I didn't teach to throw ya, threw some exercise
We did the push-up, the sit-up, the jumping jacks
And when we went through, we went around the tracks
But when you smoke that crack, you run like a snail
I didn't teach a poet that we goin' to fail
But when the test came, you know we passed
'cause we the best M.C.'s in the whole gym class

[Frukwan]
Up and down and all around
Now bust the rhythm of the Stetsa sound
Bring if you feel you wants to get snotty
Take a good look at the size of the party
It's six on the mix and Human Percus'
D.B.C. on the keys and the three will discuss, us
'cause we're the must and the cuts we trust
Grand Wizard Prince Paul is ya vitamin plus

[Delite]
We go back and forth, and forth and back
Wit the rhyme on time, we cuttin' on slack
Wit the chance to advance, and hand yo dash
Wit the rhythm that's flown from U.S. to France
We got the D.B.C. to devastate the keys
And the light skinned brother on the mix machine
It's not a funk machine that cause a heart attack
But the mighty Prince Paul on the old 8-track
It's like that ya'll, as personality wins
Frukwan, Delite, Daddy-O, best friends

[ *Wise starts beatboxing* ]

[ Daddy-O ]
Well here's a little story with an added surprise
About what took place with me and Wise
Went walkin one morning with our new suits on
Wise in his Adidas, me and my (Benetton)
Coolin out drinkin stout, talkin 'bout the world
When we were suddenly stopped by a beautiful girl
She was gorgeous, she told us that her name was Faye
She would like to get busy for the rest of the day
""Well of course,"" we replied, ""but whose date will you be?""
She said, ""(1) or (2), it makes no difference to me""
Whoa, we was with it, had a freak, we could tell
Dialed the first seven digits to the best hotel
In town, rented a room and not a sec too soon
Ordered delicious lunch, about half past noon
After stuffin our face, well, Faye wanted a drink
We ordered up the strongest drink that we could think
After she got a little tipsy I gave Wise the look
Cause we could (smell Faye's tunafish startin to cook)
She started pantin, and breathin, and lickin her lips
And then the next thing you know she was rubbin our hips
Freakin Wise on the bed, freakin me in the corner
I said, ""Why Faye, why?"" she said (""cause I want to"")
Man, it went on for I don't know how long
I thought that I knew strength, but that girl was strong
And how I knew her sexy lovin wouldn't steer me wrong?
When she kissed me on the chest, she kissed me on the neck
She kissed me on the cheek and sang this song
She said:
[ *starts to sing* ] 
""Higher than the highest mountain
And deeper than the deepest sea
That's how I will love you
So darlin, endlessly..""
Break it down, Wise
She said:
""If you think I'm (sexy)""
Say little boy, reach out and (touch me)
If you really need me 
Say little boy, reach out and tell me
And gimme your lovin, gimme your lovin
Don't forget about the all-night squeezin
And don't forget about the huggin and teasin""
- overall it was a good afternoon
(Man, I hope that me and you get to see Faye soon)
You know it, I got some more juice to release
From Daddy-O (and Wise) -

Do that roll that you created",Faye,1986
Stetsasonic,"Brace yourself for the awesome and rare
The real, the right dynamite is in the atmosphere
As there's a time and place for everything that's under the sun
This is the time and the place that we have some fun
Now take a see to check the pedigree
of the band that's spelled S-T-E-T
The rhymerator, Dee-Lite, the are-O-D
And on the keys, my brother D-P-see
Wise, Frukwan and my DJ Paul
We puttin competition back, up against the back of the wall
Me and the band that I just mention
present to you a new invention

We-we-we-we regulate a Stets-a-flucture
So def, a listen to the structure
Formulate ya own, but please don't touch a
Good lokkin out, we thank ya very much a
Heed this style on the cartwheel nightcha
Fight to the end, I bet we'll bust ya up
And ya welcome to a force that creeps
Slowly but surely, enough we'll defeat you, BREAK.....

Break: (*scratchin*)

Straight to the letter witta hip-hop band
of America, London and even Japan
And you surely will admit by bein a fan
Nobody else does it like we can
To battle us is truly a gamble
Excellence is proven by example
The ladies smile while the bodies are in shamble
Back off Puba, this ya can't handle
The rhythm homeboy is definitely ringin
The beats and rhymes are the chords that are tinglin
So grab your girl, let's start the jam
For at the helm is a band who's in demand, BREAK.....

Break:

Go (x31)

Ch-ch-ch-champ wit the punch of a verbal grenade
and a rhyme that's equipped as a barricade
Cool and clever, crack I never
Wit my crew I will never sever
Brooklyn, New York is our home town
That is the place we always go down
And every night a party goes down
And when it starts, it never slows down
We boogie to the DJ's non-stop
To the sound of the Brooklyn hip-hop
And if you've ever seen Brooklyn rock
(*scratchin of 'Brooklyn'*) rocks it non-stop, BREAK........

Break:

Go Brooklyn (x15)

Point blank, our deliverance is me but smooth
Stands out like a winner at'cha favorite tune
All tension is released upon the call of the beat
As you rock along to a funky treat
Like a torch, we're keepin you active
Our rhythm will hold you captive
We're perfecters of the poem we sing
Mobbin in to the top with the style's that's addicting
No doubt, about what we capture
A-nother classical treasure
So productive and effective
Chuck it out as a jam that's spreading

It-it ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it 'cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lotta sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Stet can lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This song is complete and captured, BREAK.....",Go Stetsa I,1986

We gonna rock to express, our methods to the catch

So rock from ya lumber, we came here to rock!

Right about this time!

We make ya shake and shiver

[ Daddy-O ]
Awaken my conscious to a jubilee
Restore me with everlastin energy
My rhyme does work when I put it to use
Makes me glow when I'm walkin up and down the Deuce
And when I'm shoppin on Delancey buyin brand new gear
Girls always want to whisper somethin in my ear
At a show old ladies even waitin in line
And it all takes place on the count of my rhyme

My rhyme
Talkin 'bout my rhyme
My rhyme

[ Delite ]
My rhyme is the force of sheer suspense
The stroke of elegance and excellence
The best and no less, seizing in your interest
My rhyme is packed with the muscle and finesse
Satisfaction guaranteed as I get ill
Definitely approved that's a thrill to thrill
My rhyme ??????? the escapade
Or at least as a teacher from my trade
Of my rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme's wrapped in a fury of hate
And dare a devil rhyme rebel my axe terminate
Subduin and pulverizin suckers from afar
Couldn't sling with the king, I'm a hazardous detour
Break north, suckers, I'm intensively hard
My rhyme is on point cause I stay on guard
It might be quiet, but it's deliberated
And when it rocks the mic, it stays motivated

[ Daddy-O ]
Sayin what I mean, meanin what I say
Hooray, you toot and chant when my rhymes are played
If I may, today, demonstrate my sway
A display like the Grammies shoulda went to Sade
My way, my occupation on the m-i-see
The way I handle my rhyme, they call it mastery
Quakin earth, crashin symbols, ringin bells over towns
And you all want to come hearin Daddy-O's rhyme
Sucker MC's fear it, my fans all cheer it
My rhyme's a category of personafied lyric
Livin, it tastes, feels, hears and sees
You may not believe it, but my rhyme breathes
It only dresses in the freshest gear
And it never wears words that I wore last year
In the summer you may hear it in L.A. at a show
Or at Miami gettin played at a radio show
My rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme is devious, but believe me it's
One of a kind, you agree from the previous
Rhymes that you're hearin is devastatin
This rhyme made Tschernobyl stop generatin
After effects of my rhyme gets bolder
It move very swift just like a locomotive
The rhymes I possess can surely produce
To any size, big or small, and I can even reduce
My rhyme

[ Delite ]
Sturdy as a bow, I'm sharp as a arrow
A king among kings, a rhymin pharao
Here to ignite, excite tonight
I'm the daddy of swing, the Rhymorator Delite
Rockin chapter after chapter and saga after saga
Try to battle me, man, don't even bother
I'm reapin and leapin to the highest bound
Shake the walls of hell as I rock the town

We're on fire, our style is the gangster rock
That burns, and add a snap to the crews per rock
Like starch gets hard, not firm as an arch
A diagram that's designed for biters to march
We're athletically inclined like a gymnast flip
And rock 'n roll could never ever hip-hop like this
It's to the beat y'all, as I go on and on
Don't stop the wop until you (BREAK YOUR ARM!)
We're on fire, raw, and we're God-conceived
The electrifyin act of intensity
Is mandatorily right the ??? coacts
Better gather up your force or you might get waxed
The trend is up to date, very sharp and chic
Hah, suave and well breeded to reach its peak
Beware of the Stet as the flame burns higher
Long live forever the Stet, hah, cause we're on fire

Young ladies, let me know am I doin okay?
Am I sharp and on point to rock ya this way?

Way above par, earning high regards
For the style I produced is (SUPER-CHARGED!)

We-we-we took a little time
Wrote a little rhyme
Spent a little money on some studio time
Came up with a fresh little funky beat
Added a scratch to make it all complete
And now it's on wax, so we can relax
And work a little harder on a little more tracks
It might add up to a little more tax
At the end of the year we claim it all back
When we're coolin on the block we carry our big box
Playin L.L.'s 'Rock the Bells' or Run's 'Rock Box'
Wearin some high-top Cons or some Fila socks
And the newest Benetton sweatshirt in stock
We rent a Cadillac stretch and explore the town
And if some fly girls pass we roll our windows down
And say, ""Hey fly girl, can we take you to the wire?
We're the band called Stet - and we're on fire""
We're ?flyer than chicks? and rollin our punches
And when it comes to rhymes, we write em in bunches
Put us at back, we went triple headers

I buy my clothes at the Gap, I really know how to rap
I like root beer on tap and I'm a shorty strapped
And like Run once said I'm proud to be black
And if I sat on a bus, it wouldn't be in the back
And I reside in the East and all the Gods say peace
And every since I started rappin' I've been Ebony Chief
And if I took the Pepsi Challenge, I'd choose Dr. Brown
Yo Wise, let me hear that Stet Troop sound

Some people call me Kareem, at work they call me Glen
I was on tour last year, this year I'll do it again
And though I'm not a politician I know all my rights
I had a fight with a cop just last night
Address my girl 'my dear', been shootin' guns for years
And I never been a sucker givin' in to my peers
The Stet says a rhyme, I'm always on time
Wait a minute - let me think of my next line

Okay
I eat at BBQ, meat-eatin' days are through
I like it in Lake Charles, I like Miami too
When I was in San Diego had to visit the zoo
And I don't like used cars, so I'ma buy one new
I'm readin' Stephen King, Joan Collins ain't my thing
Whenever I got beef, I give [Name] a ring
I cool with Walter and Lumumba in an Aero Star
Yo Wise, a little bit of that human guitar

Thank you
And in karate class love when it's time to spar
I tape the daytime soaps on a VCR
I drink low-fat milk to give my tummy a rest
I use ??? in the shower cause I don't like ???
I eat my ice creams slow, call Puerto-Ricans bro
And when I had a yoyo, I had the one that glowed
I used to make go-karts, now rappin' is my art
Scott La Rock still lives inside my heart

Now I'm a lover of hats, I make money in stracks
Love to watch The Box, music video tracks
Always stayed in school, my mother raised no fool
And if I broke any rules, then my pops got rude
Call me MC Delite a/k/a Shaheed
Here to teach and lead by my rhymin' spree
Make the crowd yell 'ho' when I go solo
Yo Wise, give me a taste of what you gave Daddy-O

I love to cool and relax with a girl that's real
She will chill at my place and I will cook the meal
I've been so many places and saw many faces
One city I remember was the city of Vegas
Other night never quits, prostitution's legit
And the crowd only cheered at the end of a skit
Oh, one other fact, I lost 300 smack
But soon I got the bets and I won it all back

All my sneakers are gold, on the mic I'm bold
Don't play me like I'm a kid, I'm 24 years old
I like to fly in a plane, call a woman a dame
Like the Empire State it's recognition I gain
Stet Troop and a beat, the world of Stet is complete
A lotta records are weak, but this one is unique
Like they were just grapes, crushin' suckers we hate
Yo Wise, come in on time, but not too late

On weekdays I build, the weekends I chill
And the closer you listen, you detect the skill
Then you think in your head about the lyric I said
You kick beats in the bed, I be creatin' instead
People booge in crowds, we can boogie alone
Though the music is loud you're in a 3D zone
Stet appearance react like a deck that's stacked
And like Radio Shack we're all over the damn map

We like cordless mics, we ride ninja bikes
We don't sing heavy metal and we don't wear spikes
We're classified as a fam, we operate six man
And if you call us a group, you get a body slam
Fruitkwan tailors clothes, Delite waxes foes
And we both rock house with Daddy-O

Stetsasonic,"Well here's how it started
Heard you on the radio talkin' 'bout rap
Sayin' all that crap about how we sample
Given examples

Think we'll let you get away with that?
You criticize our method of how we make records
You said, it wasn't art, so now we're gonna rip you apart
Stop, check it out my man

This is the music of a hip-hop band
Jazz, well you can call it that
But this jazz retains a new format
Point, where you misjudged us, speculated, created a fuss

You've made the same mistake politicians have
Talkin' all that jazz

Talk, well I heard talk is cheap
But like beauty, talk is just skin deep
And when you lie and you talk a lot
People tell you to step off a lot

You see, you misunderstood, a sample is a tactic
A portion of my method, a tool
In fact it's only of importance when I make it a priority
And what we sample of, is the majority

But you are a minority, in terms of thought
Narrow minded and poorly taught
About hip-hop, playin' all the silly games
You erase my music, so no one can use it

Step on us and we'll step on you
Can't have your cake and eat it too
Talkin' all that jazz

Lies, that's when you hide the truth
It's when you talk more jazz than proof
And when you lie and address something you don't know

It's so whack that it's bound to show
When you lie about me and the band we get angry
We'll bite our pen, start writin' again
And the things we write are always true

Suckers, get a grip, now we talkin' 'bout you
Seems to me that you have a problem
So we can see what we can do to solve them
Think rap is a fad? You must be mad
Cause we're so bad we get respect you never had

Tell the truth, James Brown was old
'Til Eric and Rakim came out with 'I Got Soul'
Rap brings back old are 'n' be
And if we would not, people could've forgot
We wanna make this perfectly clear

We're talented and strong and have no fear
Of those who choose to judge but lack pizazz
Talkin' all that jazz

Now we're not tryin' to be a boss to you
We just wanna get across to you
That if you're talkin' jazz, the situation is a no-win
You might even get hurt, my friend

Stetsasonic, the hip-hop band
Like Sly and the Family Stone, we will stand
Up for the music we live and play and for the song we sing today
For now, let us set the record straight
And later on we'll have an informal and a formal debate

But it's important you remember, though
What you reap is what you sew

This time around I come again to slam
See I write the songs that makes the young feel proud
I'm working harder by the sweat of my brow
I've been endowed with the gift to slice the mark
So take part as the four begin to spark
And the pinnacle as things get critical
I'm sweating bullets, but I'm cooler than a Popsicle
Pull off a miracle as a black symbol
That overcomes yet any obstacle
I scraped the floor, my knees get scarred
But no way I give in, cause I gotta take charge
Like when my foes want to make things drastic
I melt em down like real cheap plastic
It ain't no thing, no sweat by me
Cause I know damn well where I want to be
So join my party if you see things my way
Pick up the album right now today

Smooth dedications goin out to
My man the E Double and the PMD
Special dedications to DJ Scratch
And the Albany Projects in Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin?

We gonna break it down a little somethin like this here

1, 2, and don't forget the Daddy
O is for the only, chief is for relief
People like to talk about the Hip-Hop Band
Not that they get away with it, but they think they can
Cuttin their eyes, and frownin at Wise
And sayin Paul can't cut - kiss my butt
Don't know Bobby, smirkin at D.B.
Boy, stop jockin S-t-e-t
Do what you feel, and if you feel real froggish
Leap on this, so I can bust your lip
Because Allah made man, but man made speech
And speech is only talk, and talk is cheap

[ Delite ]
Well, like a boxer, we got the groove that sticks and moves
Boom! another k.o., and now a major news
No short cuts when it came down to this
Some have wrote us off cause we continued to persist
Without fail, our actions prevail
Success breeds, and the legend unveils
While many pop duty, the Band stood cooly
Till our chance came, and we smashed them rudely
Proved that the soft talk was all pink water
Baked and fried em and threw em all a quarter
Cause when you talk that talk, and your talk is kinda cheap
You reap what you sow, and you sow what you reap

(Action speaks louder than words)	(2x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Aiyo, the situation seems very peculiar
Like the Jungle Brothers said: I'm gonna do ya
But I'm not gonna do ya like a guy does a girl
When I do you, I'm gonna crash your world
Lights out, with the click of a switch you're cut off
You can't handle, so you break north
Then I said it before, and I'ma say it again
I'm the Daddy, O is for the wars I win, friend

[ Delite ]
Speaking of a war, yo, I get excited
The taste of victory, man, keeps me ignited
And like a bolt of light that shoots across the darkness
I'm flippin MC's out by my pin-point sharpness
Punishment is due them, I whip em very thorough
I'm servin up the hype like there ain't no tomorrow
The a-see-t-i-o-n means get the job done
MC Delite, now grab hold to my wisdom

(Action speaks louder than words)	(4x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Sittin in the park out in East New York
Soak in the sun, watchin the girlies walk
By, some say ""Hi"", and some say ""Hello""
And some say, ""How you're doin, Daddy-O?""
I say, ""Alright, but the beef I got
Is how the faggot MC's try to cop my spot""
Cause it's cool to occupy your own
But if you come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome
See, I don't really always want to be the aggressor
But my respect for MC's continues gettin lesser
And just like my mother used to say in the past
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash

[ Delite ]
So just imagine all the flack that you'll be catchin
When you're pop that weak, boy, yo, I be bashin
Rip all your bull, to show that we're winnin
By blood, sweat, no tears, we're provin, not pretendin
We daze and amaze till foes are left confused
Like some men treat their women, they get whipped and abused
Cause Stet is rolling strong, so what the hell goes on
Try to gank this, your ass is gettin bombed
Cause action overspeaks above any plight
Peace, sincerely yours from MC Delite

[ Daddy-O ]
Do you remember that day, we was on the tour bus
Listened to a tape, I think it was the Cold Crush
Suzy heard the tape and said, ""Who's that?""
Delite said (Shhh, just sit on my lap)
She said, ""Okay, whatever you say""
I saw the game and asked: ""Can I play?""
She said, ""Sure,"" I said, ""Really?
And what about the rest of the Stet posse?""
She just smiled and I just grinned
And the band, they got ready to win
Or should I say start, or should I say begin
Anyway you put it, she was all in

[ Wise ]
Started on the tour bus, she was in a rush
(Rush to do what?!) You know what's up
The bus had three rooms, she started in the first
And it was pretty bad, but the second got worse
And in the third I had to tip my hat
(You mean it was like that, hops?) Yo, it was like that
Suzy had a thing for the boys in the band
And the band bein Stet, be assured, my man
Everything that glitters ain't always gold
But for all the groups, yo, she broke the mold

[ Daddy-O ]
Speakin of a girl named Suzy
Yeah, yeah
(Suzy)				(4x)

[ Delite ]
Right before a show ???? D.C.
I looked at Wise, the Dad looked at me
We slapped five while the band got ready
Then we all glanced around for Suzy
Had a monogramm top with our names of each
A two-piece bikini like you wear on a beach
A shape no man could bever forget
And on the back of her shorts - mh, take me to the bridge

(Do it now)

(Suzy)

(Uno, dos, tres, quattro)

[ all ]
Then one day, it was in the winter
Snow was on the ground, we were leavin Philly
I was in my bunk, geared to my radio
Wrapped in his blanket, cause it was kinda chilly
Not too long after, we all fell asleep
And the snow storm got a lot worse
Our bus driver started dozin off
The bus started driftin, Suzy noticed first
She awoke the crew, and the driver, no doubt
Saved our lives, and that's a fact
And one thing about Suzy, you all should know
She may be a groupie, but we love her to the max, Jack

[ 'Suzy' ]
Ah, Oran Juice Jones
Don't be 'yo baby-in' me, I am not Suzy
Everybody, let me tell you:
Suzy is a DOG
A REAL DOG
You know, she's a real dog
A German Sheperd dog with a leash and a flea collar
And a tail and fur and everything?
She's a real dog and she's following em
Because they draggin her on a leash with a can of Alpo in they pockets!
Let me tell y'all every-
Ah, Wise
Wise..
Wake up
I'm tryin to cut a record here
Hello? Wake up!
I - I'm over here
MC Delite, I'm over here
Blind as a fat child 
I'm over here
Somebody (...) they got the 2 for 1 sale today
That's right
DBC - late again!
Child live another day, gotta take the bus, won't you get a car?
Daddy-O - will you stop spittin on me
Child, I don't need a shower, baby, you do, but I don't
Oh-oh in comes walking Gary [Name] with the Gary [Name] hairstyle
Mr. Bobby Simmons actin like a big time producer
Yeah, we all remember when
Don't start frontin now
Ah - Prince Paul.. Pat's on the phone!

Ha-ha..
Child, you been walkin down the street, guys be tryin to rap to you?
This one guy was playin the Africa stuff
He said, ""Yo baby, you know somethin?
If we was back in Africa I would marry you
I would give you 26 or 27 babies
And I will buy your mother a cow""
I said, ""Honey, if I have 26 or 27 babies
I'ma need 13 titties and I'ma BE A COW
What is your problem?""
Then this other guy walked up to me, he says
""Ooh baby, you know somethin, when I think of you?
Won't you just come over here and let me be your peppermint paddy""
I said, ""When I bite into YOUR peppermint paddy
Honey, I'll give you the feeling, the sensation
Of bein in a sewer barefooted
Now get out my face!""
These guys are so stupid, child
A lot of them think that ????? is a flavor
It's not, it really ain't!
Child, we gotta put up with them cause they all we got

Stetsasonic,"My name is Wise Supreme and I don't eat pork
I reside in Chilltown but came from East New York
From a time of bein' broke to a life of luxury
Stay in the house or you won't see much of me
But when I'm out I go to Brooklyn just to chill and max
And from my head to my toes I wear all black
No, I'm not a criminal, playin' with my digital
Lay back in my chair while collectin' my residuals
Cash that I made during winter, summer, fall, spring
But gettin' dissed by a foe is just a small thing
Rememberin' the time I was goin to a talent show
I saw my ex-partner who's now a foe, you know
Anyway, the brother said hi, cool
This took place in Jefferson High School
I was here to observe all the talented acts
He was there to try to battle, here's the facts
Was sittin in my seat, the host grabs a mic
""Stet's Human Mix Machine versus Essence tonight""
I said, ""What? Who set this up?""
The crowd started goin' crazy as they start to erupt
Between every act of people doin' their show
Essence got on the mic and said, ""Wise, let's go""
I didn't want to battle, why waste my time?
He got on stage, kicked beats while his MC started rhymin'
But the timin' stunk like the beats he was kickin', see?
Then his MC started dissin' me
I said nah, I just about had it
Time for me to wax his ass, goddamn it
Then stood up and walked down the aisle, and
You could feel the crowd's presence as they start buck-wildin'
Then hit the stage and grabbed the mic
And said, ""Who's in the house tonight?""
People started screamin' ""Pink House, Brownsville"" with total excitement
""Tilden, East New York"", he got hyped, man
I started with the 'Go Stetsa' roll, ended off 
With 'Faye', said peace and broke north
He was still on stage, at the moment bein' outraged
Due to the fact he lacked and got outstaged
The self-proclaimed King of Beats was hurt
He played me like a high piano and the boy got burnt

It's on me to start, so let me grab the handle
Bring forth the goods and slam with the ammo
Spark the charts to make heads nod
To leave my opposition like a vegetable retard
Shootin the gift to gab like a jab
And when time is up, hey you know you been stabbed
Don't get me wrong, I'm from a positive essence
Pourin the knowledge till I beat your conscience
The are the O D-e-l-i-t-e

It took a while cause of crazy situations
The Stet roadie, I am him

On the mic for the very first time
Gettin' loose while I'm kickin' my rhyme
Workin' for the Stet, the only hip-hop band
Mix Machine Wise, I-I-I think you're the man

Kickin' bits, I made you move and groove
But on on the smooth tip
Like a chameleon change into the opposite
Like the opposite of purple was brown
And if you're up, I can make you get down
And move right to left, from left back to right
It's not wrong
We got a few additions to this sing
But it's strong and not weak
And our style is real smooth
Instead of standin' there, it'll make you move
Stetsa style and style is us

Bobby Simmons, I'm the Stet's funky drummer
Don't even try, cause there'll never be another
'Cause we're the one and only hip-hop band
And as a unit, together we stand
We're not suckers like the Ku-Klux Klan
We give much respect to our fans

I'm Prince Paul and also I'ma like do with e
So if you think you're bad and you want to take a whiff
This is a style I call scratch 'n sniff
I don't bite, so let me be clear
(Hey mic controller, let's steal some of Paul's good ideas)
So now alter that and back to the plan
Yo Daddy-O, yo, I think you the man

I guess that's my cue
(Hey, listen to the man)
I guess I'm the last one rhymin'
(Hey, listen to the man)
Bobby called me a sucker
(Hey, listen to the man)
I guess that means I'm the man

Wickitty-wicked-a-wicked, I get wicked
If I got knots in my hair I just pick it
And when I'm in Brownsville I be kickin
And I might shop for my clothes out on Pitkin
I buy my records and tapes at the Soul Shack
Cool out ??on Langston Hughes?? cause it's like that
And then I take a trip to Pink Houses
Check out the girls with the pretty pink blouses

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Steve,"Just smile, just a smile
Just smile, just a smile
Just smile
Just because the morning's sunny

To say hello, to say good-bye
Maybe something strikes you funny
Or you don't know exactly why
Ain't no reason to try and hide it

A whole lot easier to let it out
First it's playin' with your eyes
Then it's makin' mischief around your mouth

Just smile, just a smile
Just smile, just a smile
Just smile

Lookin' at a sea of smilin' faces
Knowin' we're the same inside
Feelin' good to be together
Feelin' glad to share the ride

See the rainbow, see the baby
Get in the picture with the groom and bride
Holler 'cheese' and face the Polaroid
Show the love you feel inside

Do you work at a job you despise? Do you live with cockroaches? 
Have you been mugged lately? Did your favorite jeans shrink in the wash? 
Everyone has problems. It doesn't mean you have to be a sourpuss. 
After all, 

The expression you wear on your face is far more important than the clothes you wear on your back. 
Instead of letting the inside influence the outside, make the outside influence the inside. 
Act the way you want to feel. If you want to be happy, start now.
Just smile, just a smile

A smile makes someone who's mad not mad
A smile makes someone who's sad not sad
A smile makes good people outta the bad
A smile is an asset you always had

It can bring you back from the end of the world
Pick you up when you feel down
Put you in touch with your fellow man
Take an ugly situation and turn it around

Just smile, just a smile
And now testimonial from former bag lady, Wilma Fox:
I was in the gutter on the wrong side of town
I'd sunk as low as a woman can go

Eating outta garbage cans and sleeping on the ground
And prayin' for a miracle to turn my life around
One day last summer I was down to nuthin'
The air was gritty, the subway was an oven

Classic New York City, everybody shovin'
The crowd was uncouth, gettin' mad, gettin' strange
'Cept the man in the booth, the man makin' change
He looked me in the eye as he handed me a token

He flashed me a smile and a spell was broken
Just a smile, just smile, just a smile, just smile
I bust through that turnstile, I ran to my train
People still looked hostile but somethin' had changed

My express pulled in, the doors swung wide
And I started to grin as I stepped inside
I smiled as the train pulled outta that station
Sort of tickled by the humor of my own situation

Just a smile, just smile, just a smile, just smile
And my attitude spread to all fellow riders
They looked at each other and threw off those blinders
Eyes that were dead suddenly shone

One by one, they were touched, touched to the bone
As they exited that car, great smiles burst forth
Like the evenin' star, like breezes from the north
Then one by one, they all departed

And I saw what the man in the change booth had started
Just smile, just a smile
A smile is a very infectious thing. It spreads joy. 
It's a sign of caring. 
Success or failure is Caused by your mental attitude, not your mental capacity. 

Yes, a smile can pick you up outta the gutter, make you prosperous. 
Now I take taxis. You just have to smile once and the whole world will smile with you. 
And remember that old Chinese proverb: 
""Man without smiling face must not open shot. Paste that in your hat, honey. Smile.""",Smile,2001

You will understand in time.
Why you must wait,
Wait, wait, wait on the Lord;
Yes He hears you,
But for now you must wait on the Lord.

But time is His tool, teaching the greatest lessons learned;
So let Him do His work in you,
And watch the miracles come true as you (wait).

And He wants you to know that
They that wait on the Lord

They will walk and not faint;

Steve Abbruzzi,"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
Gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing

Steve Allen,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,

And I am a fool for beauty

For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Johannes Brahms is often mentioned 
In the same breath as Bach and Beethoven

These models inspired him 
To write some of the greatest music
Of the romantic era

Once during a rehearsal 
Brahms said with great conviction:

I'm not Beethoven
But I am Johannes Brahms

Wanna fizz the vodka

Steve Aoki,"Some people want to go live on Mars, you don't wanna live on Mars
You want to explore Mars
If we were to discover evidence of life on Mars, it would change the course of human history
It would be like Copernicus, discovering that the Earth goes around the sun
It would be like Galileo, showing that the moon is not a perfect circle
The moon's full of craters
So along with the many other scientific discoveries that humans have made, we've found out that
Atoms hook together to make molecules
Some atoms don't hook together, they don't, they don’t interact with other atoms

Down a lonesome Georgia highway

Ridin' on a mountain breeze

You can feel that engine roarin'

You can hear them tires scream

Thunderbird


Legend has it, it was twilight

Some thirty years ago

They say Mary's momma begged her

Please don't ride in Billy Joe's

Thunderbird


But the race was on that Friday night

Mary had to be by Billy's side

Everybody in that Georgia town

Knew that Thunderbird could fly


He pulled up beside that Chevy

Just like he'd done a thousand times

They say Billy Joe kissed Mary

Then blew that Chevy off the line

Thunderbird


But the race was on that Friday night

Mary had to be by Billy's side

Everybody in that Georgia town

Knew that Thunderbird could fly


No one knows what really happened

Or why Billy Joe drove off the edge

They say the whole town searched for hours

But they never found the wreck

While drivin' down Fourth Avenue, she combs her hair

Well, he's been waitin' for someone like her all his life
He's got so much to tell her when the time is right
He drifts into another world when she walks down the hall
The way he looks at her and says hello, oh says it all

You can hear it in his voice
You can see it in her eyes
Oh, love is a river and the river's on the rise

Love is a river runnin' wild and runnin' free
Flowin' through the heart like the Mississippi flows
Through me
It's like standin' on a levee lookin' down into the 
Delta's eyes
Oh, love is a river and the river's on the rise

So they both pretend that this is just another day
But they know one wrong move, could give it all away
With an endless stream of emotion buildin' up inside
He feels born again, and she's never felt so alive

You can hear it in his voice 
You can see it in her eyes
Oh, love is a river and the river's on the rise
Yeah, love is a river and the river's on the rise

The river's on the rise
Look out, the river's on the rise
Here it comes, the river's on the rise

Steve Azar,"I wake up just to work hard every day

I won't give up and I will not lose
Just when you count me out, that's when I'll come
Through I'm

The underdog 
The one whose back stays against the wall
The underdog
I'll still be standin' when the favorite falls
So they say I'm not that strong
And the odds are way too long
Well, I was born to prove them wrong
I'm the underdog

My baby's the best lookin' thing to hit this town
She believes in me even though her folks don't
Want me comin' 'round
They got bigger plans for her than me
I've got somethin' inside they can't see
But someday I swear they will, 'cause I won't
Always be ohh

I know every verse and every word of 1st Samuel 17
I love it when that big ol' boy's bought down to
His knees
And it sometimes seems that all my dreams are over
Nine feet tall
And I'm the little man with a rock in his hand
Just like David in overalls I'm

I'll still be standin' when the favorite falls
So they say I'm not that strong

Lookin' for my sunshine in these cold
Seattle showers

A little bit of lie, a little bit of truth
But when I dry my eyes all I see
Is you with him and not with me
You can try to pretend it's no big deal
But don't try to tell me how it feels
'Cause baby, you don't know how it feels

To be loved to be left here all alone
Goin' crazy by the telephone
In between paradise and out in the cold
Wonderin' if you'll ever let him go
I'm a fool in love whose heart won't heal
So don't try to tell me how it feels
'Cause baby, you don't know how it feels

You're finally here and I've got you all night long
Laughin' and talkin' and kissin'
Like nothin' was ever wrong
You say someday it'll just be me and you
And trust is all we need to see us through
But when tomorrow mornin' comes again
You're walkin' out and the doubt starts creepin' in
Is it make-believe or is it real
Don't try to tell me how it feels

I've got the top rolled back
On a southern born uncloudy day
Down a long stretch of highway

I know this day’s gonna be my friend
Long as I’m here, baby, in the flatlands

September fields white as snow
A thousand acres of cotton rows
Sweet gospel preachin’ in the air
Amazin’ grace is everywhere

So down to earth here in the palm
Of heaven‘s hand
Baby, that’s the flatlands

I saw an old blues man on 61
That’s a highway where I’m from
Playin’ slide guitar with a loaded gun

He’s got delta mud runnin’ through his veins
And when he sings his songs
You can feel the pain

Lord, he may have a broken heart
But he’s got magic hands
Where else but in the down home, ever lovin’
Heart breakin’, no mistakin’

And suddenly you’re veerin’ left
You got a hand full of looks you give me
And I act like I know ‘em all
Why can’t I throw my hands up and just admit I’m lost?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel

Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why

Just watch me die!
See how I die!

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go

Steve Barton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,

To put you
From my mind.

A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Steve Berman,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way, I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love

I'd hear how my mother cried for him

Is there someone to hear my prayer
I'm a simple man with simple words to say
Is there some point in asking
Asking for more only got us where we are today

Give me, food for the hungry
Give me, peace in a restless world
Give me, hope for the children
Give me, a worldwide religion

A whole world crying
Looking for something to say
We had it all and we threw it all away

You've been getting quite a name all around the place
Healing cripples raising from the dead
And now I understand you're God
At least that's what you've said
So you are the Christ you're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're divine; change my water into wine
That's all you need do then I'll know it's all true
Come on King of the Jews
Jesus you just won't believe the hit you've made around here
You are all we talk about the wonder of the year
Oh what a pity if it's all a lie
Still I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you tried
So you are the Christ you're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my swimming pool
If you do that for me then I'll let you go free
Come on King of the Jews
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are
I am waiting yes I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
So if you are the Christ yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread
You can do it on your head
Or has something gone wrong Jesus why do you take so long?
Oh come on King of the Jews
Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?

Let Your blade dig down to the soil of my soul
For I've become dry and dusty, Lord I know there must be
Richer earth lying below

[Chorus]
For I've been living in Laodicea
And the fire that once burned bright, I've let it grow dim
And the very Word I swore that I would die for all has been forgotten
As the world's become my friend

We have turned from Your Law to try to find a better way
Each man does today what is right in his own eyes
We will pay the price for our sinning 
We can never know true living, we've exchanged His truth for lies

[Chorus]

It is no small of a thing that He's done for you
By shutting the gates of hell upon the cross
We were sentenced once but now we are pardoned
And He chooses to use us though we fall

So while we're living in Laodicea
Keep the fire burning bright, don't let it grow dim
For the very Word we swore that we would die for, it must not be forgotten
Fear the world become a friend

For the very Word we swore that we would die for, it must not be forgotten",Living in Laodicea,1990

And just when I think I've reached the end

Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls through the nighttime;
'Til the daybreak comes around.

All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again.
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;

Let's go 'round one more time.

But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

In hopes of comin' true

Steve Cole,"Fortunately you have got
Someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in
the symptoms are so deep
It is much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign you name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play
I'd rather be in hell with you baby
Than in cool heaven
It seems to be the way

Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is done
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day
Stranger blue leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love
And the earth rotates
To our dictates
Slowly we make love

Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name",Sign Your Name,2001
Steve Cole,"I dreamed you were standing
On the edge of the world
And I thought I heard you call out
With one foot on the rock

And one a cloud
Was it just the wind that I heard?
Close your eyes
This world won't stop spinning you know

Close your eyes
Why don't you just let go?
Thousands of people searchin' out there
Most of 'em lookin' for love

But nothing is something
That there's plenty of
In time we'll all get our share

And they put me to bed
They always took care that I prayed

I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body
I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting inner light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Tragic visions slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time
I'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

Politically correct, isn't that a joke?
We censor music then give children guns.
On CNN, still fighting to death over Jerusalem.
A four letter disease still makes us run,
Can't comprehend that you can die from Love.

Can I start things over, and change your mind?
Can a single melody press rewind?
Can I move your feet, make your heart skip a beat?
Can a simple tune flow through you?

When you lose control you gotta go with it.
Ten feet high, flying above the sky.

Starvin' to death In Bosnia

And In the West TV Possessed and weight obsessed
The media dissects, infects
We think real life is reality TV

Can I have your attention and press rewind?
When the DJ spins, will it change your mind?
Can I move your feet, make your heart skip a beat?
Can a piece of me flow through you?

Dancin' like a booty never bounced before.
Poppin' to the back beat, up on the one.

That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back

You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here

Just like a child, who, late from school walks bravely home through the park.
To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay.
Neither quite knowing which way they are going, they sing the shadows away,
Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good.
And then I see a brand new face, I glimpse some new neighborhood.
So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true.
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you.
