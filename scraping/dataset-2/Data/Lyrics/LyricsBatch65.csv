Clarence Williams,"Yeah, everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me, nobody but me
Oh, everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me; that's plain to see

Yes, she got a foam like Venus
Honest, I ain't talking Greek

She's my Sheba, I am her Sheik

But my baby love nobody but me, yeah, nobody but me",Everybody Loves My Baby,1993
Clarence Williams,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1994
Clarence Williams,"Mandy, Mandy
Make up your mind
Preacher man is handy
Mandy, easy to find
Marching down the aisle with you

With a little Black-Eyed Susan
Stuck in your hair

Won't you decide?

In a year or two

When I return, I'll make you mine
For you and I, our love dream can never die

Clarence Williams,"I've been blue all day, my man's gone away
He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told
I tried to treat him kind, I thought he would be mine
That man I hate to lose, that's why mama's got the blues

Clarence Williams,"There ain't nothing I can do or nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me
But I'm goin' to do just as I want to anyway
And don't care if they all despise me
If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do
If I go to church on Sunday
Then just sing the shimmy down on Monday
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
If my friend ain't got no money
And I say, ""take all mine, honey""
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do

And it leaves me in a pickle
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do

Clarence Williams,"Gee, but it's hard to love someone
When that someone don't love you
I'm so disgusted, heartbroken, too
I've got those down-hearted blues

Once I was crazy 'bout a man
He mistreated me all the time
The next man I get has got
To promise to be mine, all mine

Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave

I ain't never loved but three men in my life
I ain't never loved but three men in my life
My Father, my brother and the man that wrecked my life

It may be a week, it may be a month or two
It may be a week, it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me honey, it's coming home to you

Clarence Williams,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire,
Spending my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time,
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low,
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's grin

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny,
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again,
Then I'll meet my long lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you down and out
I mean when you down and out

Mmmmm, when you're down and out,

And I had nothing but shadows

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Claret Jai,"We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

Death by lyrical injection
I kill you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay packer
I pack the zeros
Meaning mucho deniro
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda!
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumping, or playing double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

Let me tell this to the people not understanding my moxie
Animal, watch me
If you think it’s tangible, stop me
But then I hit ‘em with a flow, that they can’t even copy
See, we don’t play that
Where I’m from it’s like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for?
While you cuffin ‘em all, I’m stuffing her jaw
Then leave em for you to rebound Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I put you on a crash course in a smart car
Gon' speeding not relying on the brake pad
The car you should only drive on the race track
So the lyings bout your feelings and your Maybach
Are ghost tails for the Phantoms face facts
We ruin hip hop, slaughterhouse and payback
In the shape of a tat, you done faded to black
Go

Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I went from eating top ramin to being top rhymer
Check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind in the wrong direction
Now it’s time ya bow down and rep ? in my honor
Writ in my honor cause bitch I’m bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous girl
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key
While I’m bumping We Are The World
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn’t did he
“We run this town”
No he didn’t did he
I feel like tinting the glass,
You take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty
Your man like a black man tryna' get re-elected
He ain't get it, did he?

Sticking it to the pedal
Pedal to the floor
Just whipping it through the ghetto
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settling the score
I don’t know what ya'll hating for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waiting for
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in his ear going na na na na na
Just when you think it stop na na na na na
Everything I speak is hot
But don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I’m launching manure
Lord of the underground, God of the saw
On Hennessy black, ? to the jaw
Yeah I’m off the block
This ain't work, homie, I’m off the clock
I’m a syllable, Hannibal, killer cannibal
With a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West till I walk with Pac
We the two point 0 boys, Tiz, Crook, and Joe, Royce
New ghost Rolls Royce, pulled off the lot
Cock me, the only way you can stop me
I’m top seed, I pop green at mach speed
So watch me, if you haven’t seen the phenomenon
I spit fast as Lamborghini’s and Ramadan

We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I suggest you shut it down
Pack your ‘ish and turn around
Because tonight, we run this town
So let your feet, still swiftly hit the ground

We too dangerous for the World",Furiously Dangerous,2011

Il fait triste dans les allées du square
C’est l’hiver
On a fermé les balançoires

L’eau du bassin a gelé
Et les nénuphars sont morts
Des feuilles craquent sous les pieds
Et le froid colore

Les joues pâles des enfants
Qui jouent avec leurs pelles
Au chaud dans leur caban
Sous la blancheur du ciel

Et tourne tourne le manège
Où frissonne le grand cheval fier
Qui regarde tomber la neige
Attendant sa belle écuyère

C’est l’hiver
Il fait triste
Et dans leurs longs manteaux
Des femmes couleur réglisse
Poussent des chariots

Peuplés de lutins blonds
Qui s’endorment en rêvant 
Sous la capuche de pluie
A des bonbons géants

Elles ont dans leur cabas
Des pommes sous cellophane
Des biberons, du Coca
Des Pim’s et des bananes

Et le vieux maître chinois
Tourne ivre comme un pantin de chair
Lentement bouge ses bras
Sous le givre du saule centenaire

C’est l’hiver
Il fait triste
Au pied de la statue
Les pigeons s’y délestent
Et la saluent

Des silhouettes voûtées
Courent sous le vent glacial
Mais la bouche édentée
Du métro les avale

Elles s’en vont retrouver
D’autres coudes au comptoir
Ou devant la télé
Un gratiné du soir

C’est l’hiver 
Il fait noir
Et sur un banc je pleure
Mon amour perdu

De craie ou de noir corbeau
Mais si vous saviez

Dans les cabines d’essayage
Des femmes aspirent leur nombril
Faisant gonfler leur corsage
A l’assaut du bon profil
Dans les cabines d’essayage

Fait fondre un peu le plumage
Pour quelque bonheur factice

A terre déposer les armes

Emporte dans un nuage

A portée de toi
Un mur d’acier 
Du marbre froid 
Tu le touches 
Du bout de tes doigts
Il fait mouche
Pas toujours parfois

Juste au bord
Jamais loin
Corps à corps
Va et vient

Il plane, il plane dans ton ciel sombre
Ses ailes diaphanes te font de l’ombre
C’est l’ennui
Comme un vieux chewing-gum sous tes semelles
Comme la pluie qui sur toi ruisselle
C’est l’ennui
Cet ami
Trop fidèle

Alors tu lui déclares la guerre
Sur le ring tu enfiles les gants
Pour lui faire mordre la poussière 
A l’insatiable combattant

Parfois tu l’emmènes à la mer
Manger des glaces sur les terrasses 
Tu l’écrases avec ta cuillère 
En regardant les gens qui passent

Alors tu lui ressers un verre
Un cocktail avec des couleurs
Et  tourne, tourne ta petite cuillère
Pour que plus vite filent les heures 

Mais tout au bout de la jetée
Dans la torpeur du soir naissant
Toujours, là, prêt à dégainer
Il t’attend

Il plane, il plane dans ton ciel sombre
Ses ailes diaphanes te font de l’ombre
C’est l’ennui
Comme un vieux chewing-gum sous tes semelles
Comme la pluie qui sur toi ruisselle
C’est l’ennui
Cet ami
Trop fidèle

Tu lui colles des petits bouchons blancs
Tu lui colmates le creux de l’oreille
Le son t’envahit et te prend
Et tu vois plus le monde pareil

Les mots, les notes, les gens, les choses
Ça se mélange, ça change des couleurs
Le bleu c’est jaune, le gris c’est rose
Et la vie prend de la profondeur

Puis parfois c’est sur le dance floor
Que tu lui fais la peau des os
Et dans la sueur tu l’essores
Tu le piétines les yeux mi-clos

Tu danses tu danses tu danses tu danses
Que les basses fracassent sa carcasse
Tu danses tu danses tu danses tu danses
Combler le vide, remplir l’espace

Il plane il plane dans ton ciel sombre
Ses ailes diaphanes te font de l’ombre
C’est l’ennui
Comme un vieux chewing-gum sous tes semelles
Comme la pluie qui sur toi ruisselle
C’est l’ennui
Cet ami
Trop fidèle

Mais parfois tu t’arrêtes tu l’attends
Tu l’aimes tout d’un coup tu t’éprends
Tu le guettes puis tu le toises
Tu lui souris tu l’apprivoises

Tu le colles vous roulez sur ton lit
Et tu comptes dans ses bras endormis
Les petites craquelures en bas du mur
Et tu suis les éclats de peinture

Et ça fait des tâches jolies bizarres
Tu t’y attaches tu refais l’histoire
Et ta tête se remplit de ce rien
Tu baisses les armes, tu es bien

Tu es là, oui c’est bon
De lâcher l’affaire

私見えなくなってたんだね

何度も君に救われたんだ

その温もりで
あぁ 見上げた星空の中には
数え切れない思い出がある
私もう一人じゃないんだね
目を閉じれば 君が笑ってる

いま会えなくたって
記憶は消えないから
心にはいつも君がいるんだ
いつだって輝きをくれるんだ
あの日 君に出会えて良かった

大丈夫 明日を恐れないで

Filled with hope 'bout the step I'm takin'.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Spent a long time list'ning to the captain of the sea,
Shoutin' orders to his crew; no one hears but me.

But if I do then I know that you're sure to find it
And hope that you'll always believe the same
Speak your mind, say you're mine
And we'll lead the way to find

That I'm sorry, I did not lead
And I'm only through
And I'm sorry, I did not breathe
Down, lonely and blue

And if you find that you can't go back
Well, you know that I'm sure that I guess
'Cause we made it so strange for you to stand
Speak your mind, say you're mine
And we'll lead the way to find

That I'm sorry, I did not breathe
Down, lonely and blue
And I'm sorry, I did not think
And I'm only through

And I, I, I will hold you to a higher love

See you've got no say at all

I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.

And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""

Clark Country,"The time had come at last.
We said a last goodbye. 
And tho' we both were sad 
Neither one could cry.
Once in love, love now gone
We had to start anew.
And while we found it hard to face,
It's what we all go through. 
Sometimes you try
To understand
How love can come
Then go again. 
Just when you think
Your heart won't mend, 
It's love that finds you
In the end. 

Many years have passed 
Since we went separate ways. 
I saw her on the street.
We weren't sure what to say.
But as we talked 
Holding our own kids,
She said what we both knew:
Fate had someone in the cards
But it just wasn't you. 

Sometimes you try
To understand
How love can come
Then go again. 
Just when you think
Your heart won't mend, 
It's love that finds you
In the end. 

Young love's always so intense
Tho' not always making sense.
And while it's hard to see,
It's not always meant to be. 

We were young, we thought we knew
What love's supposed to feel. 
But now that love has found us both,
We know that it's for real.

Sometimes you try
To understand
How love can come
Then go again. 

Just when you think
Your heart won't mend, 
It's love that finds you
In the end. (Repeat slowly)",Sometimes,2004

How could you tell me that you're goin' away?

Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Careful as I get near'em, stand near and compare 'em 
Or all girl heir 'em, I'm the man with the serum 
Assets, probably dressed but still bear 'em 
It seem like they wear 'em, just for me to tear 'em

Clark Terry,"Got the cutest little way
Like to watch you all the day
And it certainly seems fine
Just to think that you'll be mine
When I see your pretty smile
Makes the living worth the while
So I've got to run around
Telling people what I've found

And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see
And when I tell them
And I certainly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me

Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been; well, who can say?
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said ""yes""
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

And when I told them how wonderful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your curly hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest thing that one could see
And when I tell them

Clark Terry,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",Ellington Rides Again: Dont' Get Around Much Anymore/Perdido/I [Medley],1964

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

All the lovely things you are to me

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1966
Clark Terry,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,1967
Clark Terry,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1970

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance

Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason

Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

Clark Terry,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

By the garden gate"",
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",

But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know

Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

We all want times in our careers,
when we make a little history.
Receive the plaudits of our peers,
perhaps that time is here right now for me.
Ah Anatoly, if I may, let me say right away,
you will be thrilled, because the other seat is filled
by a long-standing friend of yours.

Well, here we are face to face once again.

Is being homeless affecting your game?

I wouldn't know, as I have a home in England.

No, by a home I mean real home the place where your family is.

England is my real home.

What are your latest political aims?

What are you saying?

Your anti-Russian crusade, has it worked?

I am no crusader.

What is your true motivation?
That is something we all want to know.

You know damn well what my motivation is, okay?

Here we see a man under great pressure
Two fights to fight, yet he could not look fresher.
Chess and politics, I take my hat off.
To any champion, who can pull that off?

But her obsession is East versus West.

But don't you care that she is not by your side?

I think I've had enough of this discussion!

Well, we've a little surprise.
We've got your wife on the video.

Let her talk to you, give you her version
How married life has changed, since your desertion.

home movies nothing more, where are you going?

Bravo, Mr, de Courcy Walter!

Ah, Alexander!

I am glad that old film did the trick.
We are going to be able to help each other.

Heartwarming international cooperation.

I have good news about Anatoly's lady friend.
Florence Vassy's father is alive.

Really?  Well, this is good news.  Have you told her yet?

No, I was going to leave that pleasure to you.
However, my friend, there is one thing-

Yes, of course there is.

I think Mr. Sergievsky must lose the match and come home.
Do you not agree?

Sure, but there are others beside Vassy we wish to see come home.

That should not be a problem.  Do we have a deal?

We have a deal, and everybody wins.

Finally the weekend's here, a party’s goin’ down
I’m in a mood to get it started
I wanna see you gettin’ down on the dance floor

It’s that classic so remastered funky sound
Whenever you rock with Kool & The Gang
You’re guaranteed to dance

No more standin’ around, get up, get down
If you feelin’ this sound, come on, just give it up
Give it up to me, girl
Everybody put your hands together
Movin’ your feet

Give it up, girl, give it up

Now I know that you can feel the rhythm of the groove
So come on and start, just rock this party
I wanna see you get out on the floor with your dance move

It’s a party whenever the band comes through your town
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with doin’ your thing
So come on y’all just dance

No more standin’ around, get up, get down
If you fellin’ this sound, come on just give it up
Give it up for me

Baby, viajo na sua viagem
Teu corpo é paisagem
E ela que rouba minha brisa se prende só na liberdade

Tu fala que eu não presto só um pouco
Tu fala que te stresso e que te peço muito
Tu sabe que se eu começo a cavar eu vou fundo e reviro o mundo
Tu não queria um vagabundo e eu virei o inverso
E te trouxe o mundo o mundo é momento
E eu lamento muito por perder muito tempo pensando em tudo
De tudo que eu penso você é o resumo

Quando fecho os olhos ainda ouço sua voz

Mas no final sempre volto pra tu me acalmar

É que eu não sou de mostrar sentimento
O amor que me dá vida um dia pode me matar
Me desculpa
Eu sei que é foda aturar minhas mancada, né?
Tentei te esquecer por um tempo
E tudo que eu consegui nesse tempo foi só lembrar

Que minha língua no teu corpo é poesia
Mas teu corpo no meu corpo é obra prima
Tu pelada no quarto é uma escultura
E minhas loucuras são tua adrenalina

My time spent yesterday -
Trying to control the way that life would lead me in -
Has somehow failed.
And now all I do is try to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt.

And now my time spent today -
Fighting to remedy all my mistakes -
Has brought more problems than before -

and still I try to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt.

Well, Iíve been down and Iíve been out from time to time and in between.
And Iíve been sure that Iíve had doubts of all the truths that seems to be.

My time spent tomorrow -
Will be uselessly hoping to eliminate -
The inevitable.

And I'm sure that I'll be trying to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt.

Well, I've been down and I've been out from time to time and in between.
Cause Iíve been with, Iíve been without all of the things I seem to need.

If I keep this pace then I risk everything.
Now this overview of solitude has been reviewed.

Well, Iíve been down and Iíve been out.
And Iíve been sure that Iíve had doubts.
Cause Iíve been with, Iíve been without.
Yeah, Iíve been down and out.",Down and Out,2005

Classic Rock Orchestra Vienna,"Out in the shiny night, the rainwas softly falling 
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe. 
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way 
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Cafe. 
Why don't you meet me at midnight baby, inside the Sad Cafe.

In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe

The human heart a captive in the snow

Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Classic Rock String Quartet,"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven",Stairway to Heaven,2009

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

[Verse 1]
Now from the words I view, ya'll people got me thinking
Why do I continue rhyming words while I'm speaking?
Why do I continue waking up every morning?
Why do I continue dissing rappers who are boring?
Got to many questions, thought with no answers
Way too many people saying put away the sampler
Why do people tell me I should pick up a guitar?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'm a mc not a rock star
How many people feel like this?
How many people want to grip they head and feel a twist?
Trying to levitate, taking steps at a time
You can talk what you walk, no effect on my mind (Cause' I'm breaking necks)
No more making threats
People in this game claim to be natures best
Class taking bets, just for teaching y'all a lesson
But man, this ain't the time, I got one too many questions
For Real

[Chorus]
What's up, with all these questions?
I try to figure out, what I doubt, and keep on guessing
Do I trust destiny? (Whoa!)
Do that effectively
Is this like testing me?
But it won't, no it won't, get the best of me

[Verse 2]
When will I die? and how will I emerge?
When will I teach these mother fuckers not to doubt my words?
How can I keep myself together trying to survive?
How will I make through another day at 9 till 5?
I'm lost in this world, double-crossed in this world
Block everybody out; I'm pissed off at this world
Got 9 years of paying dues, and not a thing to show
Feel like throwing in the towel, call it quits and play it low
But I can't cause' I'm dedicated
I love this game, but at the same time I kind of hate it
Got me stressed and I can't figure if I'm going to make it
Got people telling me my records now anticipated, but I got questions
Like why did that peep give them beats away for free?
And how come I got greedy and started charging a fee?
How can we be happy when there's families' suffering?
And when will anyone from here win the Stanley cup again?

[Chorus]
What's up, with all these questions
I try to figure out, what I doubt, and keep on guessing
Do I trust destiny? (Whoa!)
Do that effectively
Is this like testing me?
But it won't, not it won't, get the best of me

[Verse 3]
Aiyyo, 20 years from now, and I rich or am I broke?
Am I digging dirt from ditch's trying to my c.d out?
Do I sit behind a desk working different office jobs?
Paying off a student loans instead of dropping jaws?
That life ain't for all, and that life ain't for me
I was born to drop tracks, spit on mics properly
In the future; buy property, 64 acres
My people and my squad will be my next-door neighbours. (Pshh)
That's got me wondering, imagination running wild, my days are numbering
y'all don't understanding what I'm thinking, 25 I'm finished
Unless I'm offered full-time employment in this business
Yeah? So what's it coming to?
And what am I supposed to do?
Trying to stay alive, they make that shit it's classified
But I'm doing what I want, expressing every word
This is my life, I'm living it so fuck what you heard

I write a song about what I love and hate
Like I love to get the munchies but I hate the stomach aches
I love getting drunk but hate it the next morning
Hate the sound check, but always lovin' the performance
Love for the ladies with a lot of self confidence
But hate the attitude learn to take a fucking compliment
Hate for the critics and nah forget
It's back to the draw board let's give them what they calling for
I'm at so many people and been so many places
That's why I want to write a song called forgotten faces
A lot of friends have come and gone and I'll always remember them
But I can't put a picture in my head that resembles them
And these are real friends that I hung every day
They built my character and attitude in many ways
From my teacher to my coaches to my school yard friends
Maybe someday I'll see your face again
What a hi-dea

Aight let me try something different
Bring the strings in

And I've been trying to write a love song for my girl since I met her
Something real romantic like let's get fat together
Sometimes nothings better than sitting on the couch eating whatever
Watching movie clips with taco chips and nacho dips and peppers
We had a couple ups and down and made it through
Love each other, our family, our sex and our food
These are words flowing on my pencil on this instrumental
Or maybe I should switch it up a bit adjust the tempo like
I change the beat if the topic ain't working
Fall on the floor that's perfect sounds current
Following the formula is that what you stand for?
How come all these douche bags keep running the dance floor?
Douche douche douche bag
Do it like this and you too can make a douche hit
You talking big game but never gonna do shit
Your girl ain't smelling right tell her douche it
Dance, nah fuck it back to the music
I had this hi-dea about rock and roll
And how I think it's similar to the way that hip hop will grow
They thought it was a fad made by African Americans
And no mother or dad wanted any children hearing 'em
Hated by the church they called it devil music
Now these Christian rock bands encourages kids to do it
Time changes everything I see it right now
It ain't just hip hop or rock and roll it's a lifestyle

All I do is make beats smoke weed
And come up with these hi-deas, crazy hi-deas
I just make beats smoke weed
And come up with these hi-deas, yeah
And now I'm getting so high
And now I'm getting so high

I was goin' to write a track called cliches, just talk about all those clichés you see
Those clichés you hear in life
I was goin' to write a track called small town, I come from a small town
When things are a little bit slower
Everybody knows your name it's just a little different
I was goin' to write a track called I know I shouldn't do it but I love too

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Classixx,"Somewhere in our space and time
I get stuck in your arms
I get close to you, darling
I keep clawing my way inside
And sometimes when you run and hide
Taxing and breaking and pulling and aching
And bursting at the seams
Turning your dreams into life, the life

Because somebody's always around
Watching and listening
To all of these things I found
All of them safe inside your room

You call it ballet
Stretching so thin, we're caving in until we bloom
What a day
Throwing tantrums like parties
Or attention like Sunday afternoons
Darling, you know I'll come through
Because, darling, I know what to do
Safe inside your room

Somewhere's where I think I'll find
All my head's designs
And now the sun keeps closing in on me
You're farther than you seem in the night, the night
Sometimes when you say goodbye
From your bed drenched with subtext and protest
That take us to a room full of love
Behind the glass that we touch without light, our light

Because somebody's always around
Watching and listening
To all of these things I found
All of them safe inside your room

You call it ballet
Stretching so thin, we're caving in until we bloom
What a day
Throwing tantrums like parties
Or attention like Sunday afternoons
Darling, you know I'll come through
Because, darling, I know what to do
Safe inside your room

Baby, just keep in touch
I know it might seem much
But the room is spinning and no one's winning
I think I've had enough

I know it might seem nuts

E não vai falar, que esse não é o meu lugar

Presto atenção nas instruções
Só pra poder adaptar

Nem sempre sou boa mas, sei melhorar
Anestesiada comecei a achar normal, viver desinteressada
Eu quero flexibilidade
Pra quem tá comigo, toda lealdade
Eu entrei nessa para evoluir
Se eu canto, eu fecho os olhos pra poder sentir

Minha alma despir

A cada vento
Cada linha desse verso

Mais de um preço pro mesmo tempo, e

Sobre como ser menos machista e vagabundo

J'ai les bleus, de mon chum Jean Cayé, de l'étang, des moulins à Terrebonne.
J'ai les bleus, d'une fille qui disait qu'elle n'aimait que la rue Robinson.

J'ai les bleus du bout du monde, du sourire d'une blonde,
J'ai le coeur comme Ginette quand elle chante Paris-Québec.
J'ai les bleus d'un pays loin, où frissonne l'Italien.
J'ai les bleus d'un pays froid, j'ai les bleus du Canada.


J'ai les bleus, d'une nuit à Montréal, des chansons de Leclerc, de Vigneault,
Un concert au flanc du Mont-Royal, Ils avaient rêvé d'un nom plus beau.
Quand les hommes vivront vraiment d'amour, au Québec, je reviendrais faire un tour,
Je viendrais soigner mon Vagala, et chanter pour vous à Montréal.

Claude Barzotti,"Sous un pli bleu je t'envoyais, La Tendresse de Bernard Dimey, 
Tu trouvais que c'était joli, tu n'y as jamais rien compris, 
Je t'envoyais des chansons de Brel, celles qui frappent où le cœur se fêle, 
Je pensais qu'elles pourraient, peut-être, faire pousser un arbre au désert. 

Je t'envoyais des fleurs séchées, de la lavande et des pensées, 
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux, disait Aragon amoureux, 
J'écrivais tout et sans pudeur, je me déshabillais le cœur, 
Je t'écris une dernière fois, c'est ma dernière chanson pour toi ... 

Je ne t'écrirai plus, je n'en ai plus besoin, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, maintenant tout va bien, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, le calme est revenu, la tempête a cessé, 
j'ai fini de t'aimer

Je ne t'écrirai plus, je n'en ai plus besoin, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, maintenant tout va bien, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, le calme est revenu, la tempête a cessé, 
j'ai fini de t'aimer 

Je te recopiais des poèmes, piqués à ce vieux fou d'Hugo
Lui qui savait dire je t'aime, sans jamais avoir l'air idiot.
Je me servais d'Apollinaire, et de Rimbaud, et de Verlaine, 
Ce rêve étrange et pénétrant, moi aussi, je l'ai fait souvent.

Je ne t'écrirai plus, je n'en ai plus besoin, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, maintenant tout va bien, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, le calme est revenu, la tempête a cessé, 
j'ai fini de t'aimer

Je ne t'écrirai plus, je n'en ai plus besoin, 
Je ne t'écrirai plus, maintenant tout va bien,

Claude Barzotti,"Mon père avec ses doigts noueux
M'en avait donné des taloches
J'avais des larmes dans les yeux
Et les poings serrés dans mes poches

Je n'osais pas lui raconter
Que si je n'aimais pas l'école
C'est que j'aimais la liberté
Qui se cachait dans l'herbe folle

L'enfant sauvage
L'enfant sauvage que j'étais
Etait un rêveur qui marchait
La tête au-dessus des nuages

L'enfant sauvage
Ecoutait chanter les oiseaux
Mais il savait que les plus beaux
Ne chantent pas dans une cage

On m'a fait apprendre un métier
Dès que j'ai su compter il y a
Mais j'ai découvert l'amitié
Lorsque j'ai su enfin sourire

Pour ne pas être un mal-aimé
J'ai dû lutter contre moi-même
Et je crois bien que j'ai pleuré
Lorsque j'ai dit enfin je t'aimer

L'enfant sauvage
L'enfant sauvage que j'étais
Comme les grands oiseaux rêvait
De partir pour un long voyage

L'enfant sauvage
En a vu passer des saisons
Avant de changer d'horizon
Et découvrir d'autres rivages

Là-bas le ciel était tout bleu
Ici le ciel pleure sans cesse
Mais maintenant je suis heureux
Enveloppé dans ta tendresse

Si ma guitare et mes chansons
Sont devenues mon Amérique
Je pense à un petit garçon
Sur les bords de l'Adriatique

L'enfant sauvage
L'enfant sauvage que j'étais
Sans doute est parti à jamais
Avec les oiseaux de passage

L'enfant sauvage
A retrouvé la liberté
Moi je continue de rêver

Depuis vingt ans il a perdu ses cheveux
Il nerveux, il est nerveux
Et nous cherchons en vain depuis un truc
Pour faire pousser les poils du Duc

Le soir c'est un grand diner
Car le Duc a tué
A la chasse des isards
Des pies, des lézards

Qui n'a pas plus de vingt printemps
Et moi je suis tout feu tout flamme
Et je ne tiens plus mon coeur battant

On me dit bientôt
Vous trouverez du changement

That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2004

Claude Bolling Trio,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Claude Bolling Trio,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Wait a minute, this is wrong

And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby

What you gonna do when your friends have gone away and deserted you
You'll have to be strong
24 hours can seem so long
You're taught to not care
And then not realize this world is meant to share

Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby

Even if a leader so cold wants to glory himself
We've got to be strong
Even if our reasons seem wrong

Even if the world we know may not even
Be here

Hold it! It's wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you

Hey, I try to give you everything you need

Non, rien, rien, rien

J'en ai connu des filles
M'ont bien fait souffrir
Tellement souffrir, tellement souffrir

Je n'aime pas les filles comme toi
Je n'aime pas les filles qui n'aiment pas
À la place du cœur tu n'as rien
Tu sais que tu es taillée dans la pierre 
Ou dans le bois je n'en sais rien
À la place du cœur tu n'as rien
Je sais que quand tes yeux sont très brillants
C'est la pluie ou c'est le vent
Mais ce n'ai jamais le chagrin
Et puis sur la terre autour de toi
Rien n'existe à part toi
Non rien, rien, rien

Dans le Monde les gens qui pleurent les gens qui rient
Ca ne te fait ni chaud ni froid
Tu ne vois et tu n'entends rien
Que quelqu'un ne pense qu'à toi
Jour et nuit, ce n'est rien 
Non, rien, rien, rien

Que quelqu'un pleure
Que quelqu'un souffre
Pour toi, ce n'est jamais rien
Et aussi qu'un garçon soit fou de toi
Mais un garçon ce n'est rien
Non, rien, rien, rien",Rien Rien Rien (I Was Made to Love Her),1968
Claude François,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.",J'Attendrai/Final,1969
Claude François,"Bernadette, people are searchin' for the kind of love that we possess
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend

When all the time they long to persuade you from my side
They'd give the world and all they own for just one moment we have known

Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live
But while I live only to hold you some other men
They long to control you
But how can they control you Bernadette
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me

I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me
I'll tell the world you're a part of me

In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind the world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine has always been longing for
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
For the only joy in life is to be loved
So whatever you do
Bernadette, keep on loving me, Bernadette, keep on needing me Bernadette

You're the soul of me
On that dream, you're a ? to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be",Bernadette,1971
Claude François,"All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking (She don't love him)
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when its over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear
Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when
They say ""She don't love him, she don't love him""
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me
For the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me, wake me somebody when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when its over

Girl you're what my heart desires
My whole world you inspire
I can't bear to be losing you
Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly I pace the floor
Listening to my neighbor's criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me I'm dreaming now

I said shake me, wake me somebody when its over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming
And wake me when its over
C'mon wake me, shake me somebody
",Reveille-Moi,1971
Claude François,"Oh, what a night, 
Late December back in sixty-three 
What a very special time for me,
As I remember, what a night
 
Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name,
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night
Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon
 
Oh what a night hypnotizin' mesmerizing me, 
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be 
Sweet surrender, what a night
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
 
Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light,
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night
 
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!",Cette Année-La,1987
Claude François,"Il m'arrive souvent d'être heureux 
Sans qu'il y ait de raison précise 
De toucher la main du Bon Dieu 
De trouver les gens merveilleux 
De sourire à tout ce qu'ils disent 
L'orage devient une symphonie 
Jouée par un batteur céleste 
Tout ce qui m'ennuie dans la vie 
Paraît facile et me sourit 
Mais pourquoi si souvent aussi 

Je me sens comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux 
Comme une chanson en mineur 
Avec des sanglots plein la voix 
Je me sens comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux 
Comme si j'étais seul au monde 
Abandonné perdu sans toi 
Mais la vie est ainsi faite 
Que toujours après la fête 
Le vent tourne et je reste 
Comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux 
Une chanson qui n'en finit pas 

Parfois je sens que tout va bien 
A la minute où je m'éveille 
Je chante en prenant mon bain 
Je souris même à mon voisin 
Je crois en tout je m'émerveille 
Mais dans la tiédeur du bonheur 
Se glisse comme une main de glace 
Pourquoi faut-il souffrir autant 
Pour être heureux si peu de temps 
Mais pourquoi dois-je aussi souvent 

Me sentir comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux 
Comme une chanson en mineur 
Avec des sanglots plein la voix 
Je me sens comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux 
Comme si j'étais seul au monde 
Abandonné perdu sans toi

Je me sens comme une chanson triste 
Langoureux et malheureux

Claude François,"""Hello, how are you?
Have you been alright through all those lonely,
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?""
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you ev'rything
if you pick up that telephone, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, How you feelin'?
Are you still the same, don't you realize the things we did,
we did were all for real, not a dream.
I just can't believe they've all faded out of view, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oo.
Doo da wop, doo bee doo da wop, do wah doo lang.
Blue days, black nights, doo wah doo lang.
I look into the sky, The love you need ain't gonna see you through,
And I wonder why the little things you planned ain't comin' true.
Oh, oh, telephone line, Give me some time, I'm living in twilight.
Oh, oh, telephone line, Give me some time, I'm living in twilight.
O. K. so no one's answering,
Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer,
longer, longer oh, I'll just sit tight,
Through shadows of the night let it ring forever more, oh, hoh hoh hoh.

Claude François,"Le rideau est tombé pour la centième fois
Dans ma loge déserte il n'y a plus que moi
Que moi qui me regarde devant ce miroir
Comme un clown fatigué, un enfant dans le noir

Et j'écoute la foule qui part dans la nuit
Ces filles et ces garcons qui retrouvent leur vie
Ils emportent avec eux leur provision de reves
Sans savoir que c'est un peu de moi qui s'achève

La solitude c'est après oui c'est après
Quand les soleils artificiels se sont fanés
Quand tout s'éteint
Dans le matin
Et que se meurent
Les projecteurs
La solitude c'est après oui c'est après
La solitude c'est après oui c'est après

Ce bistrot sans chaleur où nous nous retrouvons
Avec tous les amis là sur mon addition
Cette fille qui me jure que l'on s'est rencontré
A Douvres où je suis sûr n'etre jamais allé

Et la maison déserte et puis le dernier verre
Où je revois passer les images d'hier
Étendu dans le noir j'écoute le silence
Je ne sais pas pourquoi je pense à mon enfance

La solitude c'est après oui c'est après
Quand les soleils artificiels se sont fanés
Quand tout s'éteint

1. La pendule de l'entrée
S'est arrêtée sur midi
À ce moment très précis
Où tu m'as dit : ""Je vais partir""
Et puis tu es partie
J'ai cherché le repos
J'ai vécu comme un robot
Mais aucune autre n'est venue
Remonter ma vie
Là où tu vas
Tu entendras j'en suis sûr
Dans d'autres voix qui rassurent
Mes mots d'amour
Tu te prendras
Au jeu des passions qu'on jure
Mais tu verras d'aventure

Ça se chante et ça se danse
Et ça revient, ça se retient

Ça vous accroche des ailes blanches dans le dos
Ça vous fait marcher sur des nuages
Et ça vous poursuit en un mot

Et ça revient ça se retient

2. Toi et moi amoureux
Autant ne plus y penser
On s'était plus à y croire
Mais c'est déjà une vieille histoire
Ta vie n'est plus ma vie
Je promène ma souffrance
De notre chambre au salon
Je vais, je viens, je tourne en rond
Dans mon silence
Je crois entendre
Ta voix comme un murmure
Qui me disait je t'assure
Le grand amour
Sans t'y attendre viendra
Pour toi j'en suis sûr
Il guérira tes blessures

Car aujourd'hui : je me sens mal aimé

Je suis le mal aimé

Tel que je veux me montrer

D'où me viennent mes joies ?

Et pourquoi ce désespoir
Caché au fond de moi

Si les apparences
Sont quelquefois contre moi
Je ne suis pas ce que l'on croit
Contre l'aventure de chaque jour

Mais je suis là comme avant mal aimé


Car je suis mal aimé

Et dans ma chambre
J'écoutais l'après-midi
Toutes les musiques que j'aimais
Et de temps en temps
Quand une fille restait chez moi
Jusqu'à minuit
Entre ses bras le temps passait
Et je lui parlais
Du ciel bleu de Californie
Elle me regardait et l'on revait d'une autre vie
Avec un disque, une chanson

C'était sur une musique américaine
Qu'on dansait tous les deux
Mes doigts dans ses cheveux
C'était une musique américaine
Qui nous a fait passer nos plus belles années
Et tout mes plus beaux souvenirs
D'amour et d'amitié
Les jours passés dans la joie ou dans la peine
Me reviennent sur une musique américaine

C'était en avril je me souviens
Les giboulées tombaient très fort
On marchait sous ton parapluie

Je t'accompagnais et ce jour-là
Tu ne m'as pas laissé dehors
On ne s'est plus quittés depuis
On s'est embrassés puis on a fermé les rideaux
Toute la soirée je m'en souviens
On a passé le disque de Fat's Domino

Pour un seul geste de tes mains? 

Plus je t'appelle, et moins je te vois
Plus tu es belle, et moins tu me crois 
Et plus je t'aime chaque fois 

Je veux me battre comme un fou 
Contre ton cœur et pour nous 
Malgré des rivières entre nous 
Il faut que je gagne contre des montagnes 

Oh, je veux te prendre comme la fleur au printemps 
Et je veux t'entendre crier mon nom dans le vent 
Mais comment faire? Combien faudra-t-il de temps? 
Combien de rivières, et combien de torrents? Oh, oh 

Mon cœur s'arrêt' maintenant 
Devant un mur de ciment 
Malgré ces rivières entre nous 
Il faut que je gagne contre des montagnes",Combien de Rivières,1997

Je me trouvais 
Au-dessus de ma rue 

Dans un monde de musique 
Sous un ciel infini 
De concertos 
Dans un monde de musique 
Un immense océan de pianos 
Où des violons fantastiques 
Dansaient de tous côtés 
Avec moi 
Dans un monde de musique 
Où les notes semblaient 
Sortir de mes doigts 

Il me faudrait 
Des mots nouveaux 
Pour raconter tout ça

Où des trompettes au loin

Qu'un garçon doit savoir
Les filles, tu sais, méfie-toi
C'est pas c'que tu crois

Elles sont toutes
Belles belles belles comme le jour
Belles belles belles comme l'amour

Elles te rendront fou de joie
Fou de douleur mais crois-moi
Mais plus fou d'elles de jour en jour
Puis des filles de plus en plus
Tu vas en rencontrer
Peut-être même qu'un soir
Tu oublieras de rentrer
Plus t'en verras, plus t'en auras
Et plus tu comprendras
Dans ces moments, tu te souviendras
Que ton vieux père disait:

Elles sont toutes
Belles belles belles comme le jour
Belles belles belles comme l'amour

Elles te rendront fou de joie
Fou de douleur mais crois-moi
Plus fou d'elles d'elles, d'elles de jour en jour
Un jour enfin tu la verras
Tu n'peux pas te tromper
Tu voudras lui dire ""je t'aime""
Mais tu n'pourras plus parler
En un clin d'œil vous s'rez unis
Pour le pire et le meilleur
Mais tu tiendras là le vrai bonheur
Aux yeux de ton cœur

N'est plus qu'un point sur l'horizon
Mon premier amour
N'a déjà plus de nom

Je reconnais à peine mon visage

J'en étais fou, j'en étais fier
Ce n'est désormais qu'un pauvre tas de fer
Ma première chanson
Qui devait faire chanter toute la terre

Claude François,"Sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings,
you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone;

Claude François,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Claude François,"Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumblin' down
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach on out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
I'll be there to love and comfort you

I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinkin'
You're alone now, no love of your own
But darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me",J'Attendrai,2000
Claude François,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur,2004

Claude François,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,2007

Something's telling me I must go home

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you

Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen

Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky,
You'll get by

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you
Light up your face with gladness

Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying

You'll find that life is still worthwhile

Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
and I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes.
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping; 
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry.

with the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm.

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1997
Claude Luter et Son Orchestre,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?
What did I do to be so black and blue?",Black and Blue,2003
Claude Luter et Son Orchestre,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do",If I Had You,2003
Claude Luter et Son Orchestre,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2003
Claude Luter et Son Orchestre,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",Mon Homme,2006
Claude Luter et Son Orchestre,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2007
Claude Martin,"Do ya hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number forty nine
She's the only one that'll sound that way
On the Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe
 
See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts get the time of day
From The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe

Here she comes
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hey, Jim you'd better get the rig
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
She's got a list o' passengers that's pretty big

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots o' them been travelin' for quite a spell
All the way from Philadelphiay
On The Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard, all aboard

Here she comes
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hey, Jim you'd better get the rig
