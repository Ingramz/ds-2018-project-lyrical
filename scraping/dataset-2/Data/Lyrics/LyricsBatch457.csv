Anthony Drennan,"Let me see generation times
Will we hear children singing rhymes

Sweet memories gone by
They're gone by

Let me be wiser with my eyes
Let me see my love by my side

Let me see heaven

Lonely tears of searching the wilderness
How this world can lead us all astray
Don't let me cry over colourless pictures

No more bitter winds

No more troubled seas

Just forgive me

And let me see

Let me see my love

Let me see

Let me see my love

Let me see (Chorus)

Crossing the room
I recognize the child in me
I'll close my eyes to release away all my fears

We silence the rose to see it blossom back again
Step by step we walk on
Word by word we talk on

Just forgive me

And let me see",Let Me See,2012
Anthony Evans,"Always thought you wouldn't love me just the way I am
So I tried to satisfy you, I didn't understand
How misguided I was in my search to know your love

I was working hard in all the wrong ways
Living life chaotically never sitting at your feet
'Till you taught me the true meaning of grace

[Chorus]
Be still, there is peace in your arms I am free
My heart is all you want from me

So I will be still, hey, yeah, hey, hey

It's so crazy yet so amazing, now I finally see
I tried to do my best for you when all you wanted was me
You saw right through my foolishness, never loved me any less
Waiting with your arms opened wide

Now, I'm no longer afraid
I know your love for me won't change
It took me so long but now I've realized

[Chorus]

Here I am, distractions aside
Wanting you to change my life
I'm resting in your relentless love
I've finally found that you are enough
Hey, hey yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Oh, I will be still

[Chorus]

Be still, hey, yeah, be still, hey, yeah",Be Still,2002
Anthony Evans,"Drifting away so many times
Searching for something I could never find
Living the live on my own
Wondering why I felt so alone

Knew I was wrong but my pride
Stood in the way I was so blind
That's when I heard you say
Those words that changed my life

[Chorus]
Come home this is where you belong
In my arms it's been far too long
I've waited for this day to come
So my son, please won't you come home

So I ran to you wondering why
I'd ever choose to leave you behind
Longing now for your love
'Cause nothing I tried was ever enough

To satisfy my hearts desire
And mend my broken spirit inside
My whole world changed
When your voice I heard you said

[Chorus]

I was afraid all the pain I caused
Would forever mean that I'd be lost
But no matter how far I run
You said I'd always be your son

Come home this is where you belong
In my arms it's been far too long
I've waited for this day to come
So my son, please won't you

Come home this is where you belong
In my arms it's been far too long
I've waited for this day to come
So my son, please won't you come home
Please won't you come home",Come Home,2004
Anthony Evans,"Why does it take blue skies that turn to gray
Before I have something to tell you about
I'm gonna change the way that I pray
And turn it inside out

[Chorus]
So now when I say I need you
It's not the way it was before
Your glory became what my heart is beating for

I need you even more, yeah

Sometimes it seems, I'm serving you just for me
Sometimes I'm blinded by the things that I think I need
Time after time you opened my eyes
Then take them off of me

[Chorus]

All my own desires
They seem to fade away
In the power of the moment
When I say
(I need you)

When I say I need you
It's not the way it was before
Your glory became what my heart is beating for

[Chorus]

I need you even more
I need you even more

Why does it take blue skies that turn to gray.",Even More,2004
Anthony Evans,"I can?t help but think about
How you came and turned my life around

Anthony Evans,"Been thinking 'bout the choices I make
Do I listen to your voice, lord, or go my own way
Will have more excuses today?
Or will I give you my life so you'll

[Chorus]
Use me and through me your name will be blessed
I wanna give it, live it for you and nothing less
Don't wanna hide, I've decided to give you my best
To make me fearless

This is the prayer of my heart
So, now I give you my life so you'll

Anthony Evans,"It's just like you to take the harder road
To make our house a home
To make sure I never felt alone
It's just like you to see the best in me
To make me believe that I could do anything
And you never let a day go by
Without taking the time
To show me how much you loved me

Thank you, thank you for the very best you had
For always understanding
Thank you not just for what you said
But it's the way you lived that makes me want to be
Just like you

It's just like you to fall down on your knees
Crying father won't you please
Take my little boy and make him so much more
Than I could ever be
Won't you teach him to look to you for all you'll ever need
And be just like you, just like you

Thank you, thank you for the very best you had
For always understanding
Thank you not just for what you said
But it's the way you lived that makes me want to be
Just like you

All I desire
Is to follow in your footsteps for the rest of my life
So one day when I have a son of my own
I pray that he will see in me all I see in you
And I'll hear him say

Anthony Evans,"On the outside, you think I'm alright
There's a smile on my face, everything's okay
But on the inside there's a different story
I've stumbled down this road and I've got so far to go

I'm a broken man
On my knees again
Longing for a touch from you
I need your hand to

Restore me, I need your mercy
Take me to the place I used to be
Use all the pain and the hurt
To do a greater work and restore me

I wore my mask, running away from my past
Hiding all my scars, thinking I'd gone too far
But he knew my pain and he loved me just the same
He promised, I'd be free if I fell on my knees and cried

Restore me, I need your mercy
Oh, take me to the place I used to be
Use all the pain and the hurt
To do a greater work and restore me

Restore unto me the joy of my salvation
So I'll sing again, the song you wrote for me
Give me a clean heart, I want a brand new start
Like the moment when I first believed

Restore me, I need your mercy
Oh, take me to the place I used to be
Use all the pain and the hurt
To do a greater work and restore me

Give me another chance
I want to be a new man

Anthony Evans,"There been many times when I couldn't see
What you had in store for me and
There been many time when I didn't know
Which way or where to go
Times I walked around head hanging down
Full of insecurity
Wanting to find out what this life's about
But you told me to wait and see cause

You hold the stars in place
Order time and space
And yet you know my name
You hold me in your hand help me understand
Your love will never change
'Cause you know my name

I've wondered why every time I try

I just seem to loose my way
Nothing's making sense and at my own expense
It's a heavy price to pay
But your always there taking all my cares
So ready to be my friend
Every where I go I know
There's no place you haven?t been

You hold the stars in place
Order time and space
And yet you know my name
You hold me in your hand help me understand

Anthony Evans,"There's a part of me no one sees
No one ever finds
There's a mystery deep inside
The constant struggling of who I am
And who I want to be
I'm always trying to decide
And it feels like forever
It feels like I'm wasting my time

Then you
You opened up my eyes and now I see
That you
Will finish what you started here in me
So I choose
To follow you and leave it all behind
I'm not giving up this time
You're worth The Fight

In the heart of me I believe
That there will come a day
When every piece of my will be rearranged
I'm hopeful as I wait
hanging on each word you say to me
I know I'm better off this way

Your worth
Every mountain I will have to climb
These wars raging in my soul and in my mind cause
I'm sure that one day I'll be looking in your eyes
and that's worth the fight",The Fight,2006
Anthony Evans,"Hold on you got the wrong guy
And I'm wondering why you don't seem to see
The job at hand needs a better man
But for some crazy reason you?re calling me
Overwhelmed and under prepared
It's written on my face I'm scared
Then I hear you call out to me.

You don't have to be good enough
This love is for free and it's more than enough
I'll be your strength in all you say and all you do
My Love will make you
Good enough

You don't have to be capable

Just be available to follow where I lead
Whatever, whenever, wherever oh you'll
Never believe all the things you can do through me
So when this big world makes you feel small
Hold your head up high and walk tall
'Cause this is where the good news begins

Blessed are the poor they will inherit the earth
And the weak they will find their true worth
He said come all you weary come get closer to me

You don't have to be good enough",Good Enough,2006
Anthony Evans,"Verse 1
I don?t want tragedy to be the only 
Thing that leads me to your throne 
With every moment of my life 
With pain or joy I will cry 
You are God alone 
You?ve given me the choice to kneel or walk away 
I?ve struggled with surrender long enough to say 

Chorus
I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose now. 

Verse 2
I have the scars I can?t deny from 
Thoughtless words and foolish times 
But you still forgave 
I wondered down a thousand roads 
Lost my way but you led me home 
Where I was safe 
I know heaven is a gift of your grace 
But until I see your face 


I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose 

Bridge
To glorify your name 
That?s why I was made 
To worship and obey 
I won?t wait

I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose now.

To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose now

Anthony Evans,"Chasing a dream so many things
Capture my affection
Running ahead I've been a mess
Losing my perspective

This is my obsession
Always chasing the wind
Left with nothing in the end

It's meaningless without You
It's meaningless, these treasures I possess
Only You, You satisfy and only You sustain my life
Without You, oh, it's meaningless

Feeling You near, it's coming clear

Focus my direction

With intimate insistence
You overwhelm my senses

Of your faithfulness

Precious redeemer and friend
Who would have thought that a lamb could 
Rescue the souls of man 

Oh you rescue the souls of man. 
Counselor comforter keeper
Spirit we long to embrace
You offer hope when our hearts have 
Hopelessly lost our way 

Oh we've hopelessly lost the way.

You are the one we adore. 
You give the healing and grace our 
Hearts always hunger for 

Oh our hearts always hunger for. 
Oh mighty infinite father 
Faithfully loving your own 
Here in our weakness you find us 
Falling before your throne 

Oh were falling before your throne 
You are the one that we praise 
You are the one we adore 
You give the healing and grace our 
Hearts always hunger for

Anthony Evans,"If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

With every breath I take, with every heart beat,
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment
I, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad
And I will boast in the cross, I boast in my pains
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign (rain)
What's my life if it's not praising you
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit, I do
That count my life as any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call

If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air
God has never been obligated to give us life
If we fought for our rights, we be in hell tonight
Mere sinners own nothing but a fierce hand
We never loved him we pushed away his pierced hands
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turn my heart away from selfishness
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery
I know the spirits purging me of everything that's hurting me
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes
So now every morning I open Your Word and see the Son (Sun) rise
I hope in nothin', boast in nothin', only in your sufferin'
I live to show your glory, dyin' to tell your story

If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

Glory was solely meant for you
Doing what no one else could do
With all I have to give, (With all I have to give)
I'll use my life, I'll use my lips (My Lips, Yaaa)
I'll only glory in your Word
What gift to me I don't deserve

With every breath I take, with every heart beat,
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment
I, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad
And I will boast in the cross, I boast in my pains
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign (rain)
What's my life if it's not praising you
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit, I do
That count my life as any value or precious at all

Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air
God has never been obligated to give us life
If we fought for our rights, we be in hell tonight
Mere sinners own nothing but a fierce hand
We never loved him we pushed away his pierced hands
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turn my heart away from selfishness
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery
I know the spirits purging me of everything that's hurting me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Wet the whole entire street up
Blast from the car seat-er
My enemies wouldn't even wanna be you

While we creep all over the place
Looking for space
In case, see him, rinse my whole clip up in his face
As my squad hold they post down
We patiently waiting for them to pass through
Carefully timing the way we put it on their whole crew

Aeiyo, Bust give me the queue

Suck his whole shit, his whole crew busting

Anthony Hamilton,"Got my back against the wall now
Problems that I didn't see
We got caught up in tangle
Then you tried to swing on me

How could I justified
Mistreating the love of my life
I ain't too proud to beg for better, baby
That's what I deserve

Tried to be good to you
Even stood there by you
And you ran out on me anyway
I must have been a fool

'Cause all is fair in love and war
So when your fighting someone you love, you better be careful
There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know
'Cause in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

Here comes him again
Streaking in my back door
Bruised heart torn from trampling
From years of my past

I'm painless and I'm angry
No time to catch feeling
I've been done wrong so I'm stone cold
And down to get even

Loves a gamble
And I ain't winning
Torn up from my past
Love don't live here no more

All is fair in love and war
So when your fighting someone you love, you better be careful
There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know
'Cause in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

All is fair in love and war

There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know

So why you wanna hate me?
(All is fair in love and war)
I tried to hurt you 'cause you tried to play me out
So why you so cruel to me?

You took my heart and you tried to play me soft?

You took my heart and stoned it

I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on
All I was, was good to you

I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on

I tried to hurt you 'cause you tried to play me out
Why you run around on me?

You took my heart and you tried to play it soft

How long can this last?
(All is fair in love and war)
I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on
You took the best of me
(All is fair in love and war)
I took the best of you

ain't too many more days, I'm gonna be treated this way
(In love and war)
And it ain't too many more lies, I'm gonna listen to my baby

If you listen to me, things will go a little bit better

Why would I listen to you?
Willing to give you a chance yes I am

It takes control of me when I see love in your eyes your like 
A spring time breeze you send chills through me a natural high

And there's no one else like you baby last night I realized
That's why

Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again

It was unbelievable when you touch me so tenderly your kiss 
Was so sweet and though you will never know it was like a dream
I hope that it will never end please do it again cause it feels 
All right I need someone to pinch me please cause I can't
Believe It happened in one night 

Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again

Anthony Hamilton,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine,
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide,
And woulda' tried but when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head with the little bit of homeboys that remain,
'Cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love
When I need to escape the deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night,
It had me shook drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Ain't no place I'd rather be

Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing

My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle

Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady

Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone 
And don't know what to feel 
Since you been gone, gone away. 

Used to love me now you want to leave me, 
Right when I told you I love you 
Don't think you ever believe me when I said. 
Use to love me now you want to run away, 
Right when I told you I love you 
Don't think you ever believe me when I said 

Oh, I love you, oh I love you, I love you 
You were my baby 
You were my love sugar darling 
I know he didn't love you the way I did 
Baby oh I love you 
Don't you know I cared 
Don't you know I love you 
And I always want to be there 
Oh, you know I love you 
You know I love you baby 
And you know he really didn't care about you 
I never would have hit you baby no no 
Said I never would have hit you baby",Lucille,2003

I can tell by the way that you kiss me
Tight when you hug me 
Took me to school the very first day 
Gave me a piece of butterscotch
Sent me on my way 
I know it's frightening 
I could tell by the pain in your eyes when the rent was late again 
To strong to fold
Being on your own

Mama knew love like the back roads 
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes 
Mom swear you never have to worry again 
Mama knew love like the back streets 
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet 
Mom swear you never have to worry again 

Up bright and early
Scrambled eggs
Swellin' in ya legs
Bills on the bed 
Still you managed to show me a smile 
Then walk to work about two or three miles 
Mom I'm gonna struggle witcha 
I'm gonna help you see the bigger picture 
You gave me something no one could take away 
You made it so easy to say...I love ya mama

Anthony Hamilton,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine,
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide,
and woulda' tried but when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, 'cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night,
it had me shook drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family

Average man when the rest was ashamed to be 
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin me 
Ooh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh... 
So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya 
Nobody never gave us nothin but tough time and made us somethin 
Different stretch of road, new somethin to see 
Every state on the map, a different somethin to eat 
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin for real 
Everybody makin a killin man, showin no feelins 
Walkin off collectin pay, it's the way of the world 
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world 
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world? 
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world 
Nappy then, Nappy now - Nappy for a bit 
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit!

Even though I picture better days, 
I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen 
The Lord done blessed me with his grace, I wish this day would never end 
We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump 
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come 
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all 
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin this call 
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong 
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long 
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin me, ""Daddy be strong"" 
We gon' make it through these hardtimes 
Even though they go and they come 
Ya absolutely right, for somethin happen to me on last Tuesday night 
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade 
Naw brave any order but confoldure 
Better make it home when nothin seems to matter 
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way 
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J 
Front porch, chillin broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo

It's a blessin we woke up this mornin 
All my colored folk stressin, come let's join hands 
Got the folk with depresses of being po' man 
Poppa taught me an order, survive for no man 
Nappy got some for we gon' stand 
Prophit grew from a juvenile to a grown man 
Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man 
Zonin, two blunts a mornin, by sunrise sometimes 
I love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again 
Damn I hope you play this song again 
The soul cleansin, the melody just read my end 
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin my lady 
Been searchin bendin and saw my folks locked in the tennants 
And it don't make any sense (why) children and sentencin 
Broadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences 
Just lower my income, (what) though we ain't finish it

In a slump, head-shot got me pumped like a gauge

Slept and ate with our peeps but we let the streets raise us
Kept the weed blazin, don't let the drink age us
Used to live outrageous, now we just couch potatoes
Without the wages, to break out the project cages
Make do with what we got, use the logic that God gave us
Losin faith is enough to make a man crazy
Can't even pay my landlady
How the fuck I'm 'posed to save for my unplanned baby?
Joined the Navy, and my uncle sayin ""pay me""
Maybe I'm just too damn lazy but you can page me

Holdin down my spot on the corner like Champ Bailey
But I know I ain't the only one (you feel me?)

Scream when I felt this shit
Toured for 16 months straight, lost breath for this
Heh, yelled for this
Sinnin every night, know I'm goin to hell for this
The hurt and the betrayal, compelled by this
Tough wall to climb but Nappy Roots scaled the shit
Just don't let me rap in vain, people pray over this
Don't take my word for it, see for yourself and shit
Everybody out in the wind, ain't no help with this
I coulda thrown in the towel, coulda walked away
Eyes on the prize, so I'm strong today
Simply want it, believe it, think it, breathe it
Chase it, cease it, maintain, keep it
Hold it, control it, never let go of it
Hold on, press on, push on, I'm gone

Can't hide the truth, descendants of pain
So y'all get exposed like the sons of Hussein

Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't riding if they part of your set?
And why they never get it popping but they party to death?
Yea, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner? It's going down
Why they selling niggas CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of trying to be fly?
Why is ratting at an all time high?
Why are you even alive?
Why they kill 2pac n' Chris?
Why, at the bar, you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Cris?
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw?
Why'd he kiss that whore?

Is this pain that I’ve been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way

Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop letting niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least?

Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reaching for my dutch?!
Why rap? Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dying?
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they living with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screaming like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcing you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?

I went through, 8 different schools in, 12 different years
That's 30 different teachers, over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought in e'ryone, been suspended e'rytime
Besides a few a felony, done committed e'ry crime
But never braggin on, just want you to see me what I done done
I'm never proud of it, so I don't have to go back there again
And uhh, I used to go like house to house (man)
Sleepin on couch to couch (you know)
Walk around stickin out my hands, lookin for a handout
Only thing I handed out was more bills
Only thing pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills
Either that or go beat the block
Ain't no way you can beat the cops
Ain't no way I can beat the clock
Just a matter of time shut down your shop
Ohh, you stay up day and nights, livin this way of life
I was +Young and Restless+
+All My Children+ came and then I had a +Guiding Light+ (hey)
No more of that sittin mayne (c'mon) sittin and waitin
and thinkin somebody comin to take me up off them streets
But now I know..

I don't believe, I've made it this far

I can't believe, I've made it this far (Whoo, yeahhh)
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know

I can tell you right now, I'm sayin
I could sit here and count on one hand
How many people seen me graduate
I know a few that did but a bunch that ain't (hey)
Same folks showin up in swarms, waitin for me to go on
Wantin to see Ali perform, wasn't so po' before
I became this household name
I was playin them Little League games
Nobody curred if I go 0-for-3
Nobody out hurr rootin for me but my Momma
Supported me in e'rything, ""Why she get e'rything?""
Some people got the nerve to ask
why'all can kiss my a**, and that's my Momma
Got a sister that need my help (hey) and I gave peace all with wealth
Give anything that I have, just to see her in perfect health
Now we out hurr complainin, ""I got work to do"" (ohh)
How bad you think you got it, somebody else got it worse than you (hey)
I done had them down and ups and, don't plan on comin back down (no)
Don't plan on leavin hurr no time soon, but I got too comfortable now
Wouldn't have no knowledge of wealth, without no knowledge of self
And I'ma keep walkin this road - my mind, body and soul

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot

Sippin on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin to talk up on the shoppin spree
Or a be	 of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass 
and drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks
Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock why'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props
Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin up shops for lots comin back nots
Each and everyday of the week 
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat
Bustin flows in the cipher getting deep 
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and want to try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store 
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks 
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back

One morning I
Woke up next to a choclate fee and a red bone 
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out 
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop 
I'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang 
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin
Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising 
Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin off the front with the blunt 
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest btiches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the be	's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking be	's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please

Once again, another trax productions
Rush for the 9-8, mobsta elites
Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet
Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit

Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration
And gotta face incarceration
Eh yo, liffy stokes, let 'em know what's happenin'

A nigga been hustlin' so long, god knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed
I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb
Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin 'bout my life of skrill
And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill

Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla

Take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away)

This shit I've been tokin' is potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' mary jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the foe
I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a rolce royce
Rollin' deep through this chi-town streets
With my mobsta elites on the way to north riverside mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at
Keepin' shit tight for why'all

On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket
Nickel sacks in the other
For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot
But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother
Straight up hustler
What's the mental frame of mind
That nigga had to have the roll
Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' for you mr. reaper
Forgive those, I explode like see-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every directions
A nigga stop a moment from getting made
I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid
If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, gd's or foes
Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes
Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my cd's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall
Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball
Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall
Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller

Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air

Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto
Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again

Who totally turns your life around completely
Helping you get a job and keeping you off the streets, church on Sunday morning
Eventually I'm saving money
Sending my life in a new direction, now I'm friends with my old man again
Standing here wearing this wedding band I can say I knew love because of you
Say I know love

I know what love is all about
I know what love's all about

I used to think that love was just a weekend thing
The way you make me feel, sharing a moment
Of emptiness, but you see that wasn't nothing
Cause the moment she left I forgot about her, until you
Came in and you showed me what it really felt to be loved
And kissed, and held, and prayed for, and
Wanted, and nurtured and guided, and ohh to be understood

I know what love is all about
I know what love's all about

And I'm feelin' it, I'm livin' it

I got somebody who loves me for me
Got somebody who loves me for me
I know sometime I have to realize that sometimes its about compromise
And you can't always have your
Way, cant always have it your way,
Love is about realizing and love is about redirecting your discisions
Whether to go out all night long or go home to the one you love
Its about taking care of your family, and
Taking care of your kids, and holding your wife at night
And letting her know that the bills will be paid

Anthony Hamilton,"How could I ever hide what I felt
How could you ever say you never knew
All along it was there on my mind in my heart, 
It was the feeling, I was in love.
You act as if you never knew my name, 
How could you treasure puttin' me through so much pain, 
Like a child in the womb I needed you to give me love 
I miss that feeling of being loved

[Chorus]
How could I ever love again
How could I start to love again
After you broke me down, 
Its hard to trust that feeling, 
To fall in love again

A man don't usually fall no more then twice 
And if he does you'll never know cause he wont say,
For the fear of being fooled taken twice by the heart, 
It's in his nature, to be afraid, he starts to
Wonder if its really right, 
To let his past take control of his life, 
Maybe I'll run into hope, someone
That's right for me, 
And she'll love freely and fall in love again

You know what they say about a man its hard for him to fall in love

I know the situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice...

Verse 1:

Just think just think
What if you could just
Just blink your self away
Just just wait just pause for a second
Let me plead my case
It's the late 70's, huh
You seventeen, huh
And having me that will ruin everything, huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on they wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars that's the price of living, what?
Mommy I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go through with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move

How you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping off the bus when the rain is pouring
What you want:
Morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?

Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

Verse 2:

I'm a child of the king
Ain't no need to go fear me
And I see them flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scary
Cause who knows what my future holds
Yo the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo you ain't even showing I'm just 2 months old
Through your clothes try to hide me deny me
Went up 3 sizes
Your pride got you lying saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in WIC food lines
Your friends will look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside take a look at your tummy
What is becoming ma I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he's a star from the ultrasound
Our spirits connected doors open now
Nothing but love and respect 
Thanks for holding me down 
She let me live 

(Chorus)

It's uplifting fo'real y'all
I ain't passing no judgement
Ain't making no decisions
I am just telling ya'll my story
I love life
I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
A strong woman that had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening
Mama thanks for listening",Can I Live?,2005
Anthony Hamilton,"Met him on a Sunday
Oh, it was first day of the rest of my life, oh
(Haven't been the same, since you called my name, everything has changed)
Made me bloom just like a flower
Since the first time we took a shower
Made love for hours (oh)
And I could feel the power of your love
Girl, I'll be true to thee
As long as your lovin' me, givin' you the best of me
Lovin' you is my destiny
I always put you first
(I always put you first)

(You do) And I'll never walk away
(Never walk away) Cause you give me more than anything 
And in my heart 
You'll always have a place
Baby boy, I'm here to stay
Cause I am your woman

[Chorus]
More than anything
More than a diamond ring with a stone in pink 
You're been more to me lately
You mean more than those things
More than the air I breathe (more) 
More than the food I eat (more)
More than the shoes on my feet (more)
Oh, you are more than to me

The moment that I saw you 
Knew I was crazy for you 
The look in your eyes
(Said those things, many things to me)
Girl, join this walk with me
Believe me when I say, 
I'm with you for life,
Right by your side, make you my wife

Girl, I'll be true to thee
As long as your lovin' me, givin' you the best of me
Lovin' you is my destiny

You'll always have a place

Cause I am your woman (yes you are, yes you are)
I am your woman, boo

[Chorus: x2]

You're my autumn when the seasons change
Falling in love, can't wait to change to rain
Boy, you're like the sun rays
Shining down on a special day
Like sand to a beach
The sweet to a peach
You make my heart beat
Change me from Miss to Mrs. 
Granted all my wishes, you're more

[Chorus]

More than a friend becomes a lover
Here to the end don't want no other
Through thick and thin
We've got each other
More than anything
I ask for 
Or pray for
You are my joy, oh",More,2005
Anthony Hamilton,"Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
To hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold

She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things

But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Tell me what could it be 
To let you walk away so freely

Tell me why you play with me mind

Well
I remember when I used to love someone that looked just like you
And also I can remember the smell of her sweet perfume
She used to tell me things that I used to love
She had a way of getting the best of my heart
And also she had a way of keeping me smiling
But now she's gone

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

Also I can remember the first day that you came in my life
(Came into my life)
It seemed then that you were a little more open with all of your thoughts
In them days you used to talk to me

But now I don't know who you really are
It seems that the look of your eyes is that you're driftin' off from afar
And you don't even seem the same
It's like you're playing a game with me

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

The love that I once knew still has a hold on me
I tried, oh I tried to love you

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

Anthony Hamilton,"I never meant to hurt you
She was just a friend

I know I've made mistakes
Times before did ignore
The pain in your voice
There was writing on the wall

And it don't take a fool to see
You were right for me
Meant to be in the beginning
Why we had to take this fall

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

Girl, I never meant to hurt you
Didn't really mean to hurt you
Tried my best to show I love you
And it all turned out so wrong

I'll be sitting waiting for you
'Cause I know patience is a virtue
Gonna do just what I got to
Girl, I love you

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I had some time to think about this
She's your friend and not our friend
That was a problem from the beginning
I care for you and I trust you too without guessing
But intentions of some folks, I had to question

I tried my best to show you I loved you
I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
If she was just a friend then why does it hurt so?
If there's nothing going on, honey, I will stay with you

It's like a plan gone wrong since you've been gone
Nights alone, my worlds gone cold
It's like I'm hiding from my soul

I had to meditate and concentrate
On doing with disappointing me
Honey, I want to come home

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I never thought you'd hurt my emotions

",She Was Just a Friend,2005
Anthony Hamilton,"I spent my years isolated
Couldn't live with myself
I was trouble as a young kid
My tears didn't help
Very depressing and it was evident
I'd fade to the deep
All alone like these four walls came at me
Barricaded cause my mind state
I just wanted to die
Never happiness
Just sad time living a lie
Rater leave me
I was suicidal
Slittin' my wrist
Mamma thinking I was crazy
Like use some sense
And on them days I was feeling
I was paining inside
It wasn't me
It was my inner feeling coming alive
I remember waking up like I was going to school
Left me standing in the hospital
Locked in this room
Put away
I was a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short
Of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me
And I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

[Chorus]
Sunshine to the rain
When it comes it goes again
Even when the story ends
Just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days
Don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way
Your sunshine for cloudy days

Now I was raised in a neighborhood
With half of a dime
If you was real it was understood
It showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle
Sprawled on your face
Drug wars
Growin' up raw cause violence the case
Had to move along
Quiet it's kept
Spoken words got you dealt with
So ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile
They telling me get down for they wealth
No getting high
Cause when you gettin' high
You needing some help
As far as help
Mine was middle though
You know how that go
Psychologically
I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus
Somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no
Better of if I was dead
Cause they killing me slow
All in all it's just a part of my life
Watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep
Except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen

[Chorus]

I prayed my last days of sunshine
Just die in the rain
Kinda selfish
But I know that dying
Eases the pain
Heartfelt words
Spoken hurt
Provided the frame
For the picture I done painted for the master to explain
So I leave behind my testimony
Witness to give
Far from holy
But this matrimony provided the script
To live on
And live by
Grow up and grow on
Get on and get by
So forth and so on
And this here's the last days
I can hear the horns singin'
I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating
I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings
And while leaving you here
Believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe
Believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal
Cause I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

[Chorus]",Sunshine to the Rain,2005
Anthony Hamilton,"Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Well oh oh..) 

Up in the street and misguided never payed attention 
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided 
to let my soul confide with the lights of him 
Who the father, my bread and my water 
I never bought a cue and into this (?) 
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites 
It'll take your life to be a Christian man 
I hope you learn, everything else 
Is in vein so you're bound to burn 
Gonna break your bone 
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule 
Trying take control of you 
That's all the devil do 
God was in Jesus, God is in us 
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust 
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes, 
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone 
I never understood why what can make a man cry, 
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side 

Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh) 
(Well oh oh..) 

Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene 
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again 
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose 
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle 
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love 
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you want to bust 
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying 
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel 
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing 
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms, 
Judgment was man-made, not a [..], and this I recorded, 
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat, 
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell, 
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here 
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked up in jail here 
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near, 
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear, 
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games, 
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing 

Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And Girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Never crossed my mind) 
(Well oh oh..) 

I can never make it, I can never ever make it 
Without you baby 
Cause you've been my best friend 
Girl, 
When everybody turned their back on me, 
You were there when I fell down on my knees 
And I give you all, all of me, 
And every part of me, oooowoooo, 

Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(For long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin you has never crossed my mind 
(Never crossed my mind) 
(Well oh oh..) 

I'm a live, I will never leave o no no 
When the people say, c'mon and go with me 
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend 
nobody understand, but they can't look inside of me, 
o yeah..

I love you

You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
(I know it ain't easy)
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you 
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?

Anthony Hamilton,"Oh my babe
Oh my love

Early was the morn
Flowers filled with dew
I became somebody through lovin' you
Softly as a child
Born in natural rain
I predict the seasons to go unchanged

Sometimes in life
You run across a love unknown
Without a reason
It seems like you belong
Hold on dear life
Don't go off running from what's new
I became somebody through loving you

Warm was the sun
That covered my body so
Reminding me of you
As I first known
Those were the days
The days that changed my life
And made me new
I became somebody through loving you

Sometimes in life
You run across a love unknown
Without a reason
It seems like you belong
Hold on dear life
Don't go off running from what's new
I became somebody through loving you

As the sun shines
Down on me
I know with you in love is
Where I wanna be
Oh sometimes
I go on through life
Thinking love is something that is not meant for me
Whoa

Somebody somebody
Hold on dear life
Don't go off runnin' from what's new

I became somebody through loving you

I became somebody through loving you

I became somebody through loving you",Dear Life,2006
Anthony Hamilton,"I used to think that I was living big
Bet my money on almost anything
Time and time, I got caught struggling
Oh, I had plans, I had dreams

And I had an open bar policy
Spending time tryin' to numb the pain
Lost my family just to gain a friend
Oh, strange faces I didn't need

I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast

My folks used to tell me
Turner stop and think
Don't waste your whole life
Doing selfish things

Hurting your loved ones
Just to get yourself a stir
There comes a time when
You gotta let it be

I thank the Lord
He had his hands on me
Not really thinking


I had sunken deep

I looked all around
And I was standing all alone
I had dug my myself a hole

I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run

Anthony Hamilton,"[Intro:]
Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about whats going on in the hood


Uh Uh, yeah, uh yeah yeah 
This your boy chingaling man, 
Need to talk to the world real quick, 
Talk to em man, 
You know we got a lot of problems going on in the inner city, 
In the ghetto, in the hood, they ain't hearin' you, 
Ain't nobody touchin' on, 
Democrats, republicans, all those folks, 
You know they don't care 
Whats going on in the ghetto anyway


[Verse 1:]
Errday I wake up 
With a regular mentality, 
But I'm a target on the street and thats just reality, 
Cats in the ghetto ain't never had a high salary, 
Except makin' deals and selling blow in the alley, 
See the system was made for us to fail, look at the jails, 
Overpopulated with Mexicans and young black males, 
I ain't tellin' the tale, so we choose heaven or hell, 
Don't care about letters from school, 
We'd rather get street mail, 
I been a witness to some murders snitchin I do without it, 
But then I wonder why the damn police dont do nothing about it, 
Go to the unemployment office, hell yeah its crowded, 
Our hoods takin' wrong turns now its time to reroute it, 
I know a lil' dude 13, 
Carry a burner dropped out of school, 
Teacher said he wasn't a fast learner, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years I wonder where we gon' be, 
When I say we, I mean my black community, ya digg

[Chorus:]
They dont know, 
How it feels to hurt so long, 
Cause they never walked in these shoes, 
And they never had to cry these blues, 
How many men, turn their back on us so long, 
Always say what they gon do, 
But they never seem to come through

[Verse 2:]
Pardon my french but I dont think we ready for a lady president, 
Its evident that its a mans world so thats irrelevant, 
The system think we all niggas and we not intellegent, 
But martin luther and malcolm taught me before im heavensent, 
The girls havin kids and they still some kids, 
Poppin' them out one after another like thats what it is, 
Its innocent cats doin bizz, 
They just tryin to life, 
And the police dont even know if the crime they did, 
Its got my brain in a twist, so im twistin a leaf, 
On my balcony smokin and drinkin trying to see some relief, 
If I can change our neighborhoods I would, put that on me, 
This world messed up, and that Stevie Wonder can see, 
So to my dogs locked down set ya mind free, 
Cause you and I dont even believe you can get your degree, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
And when I say we I mean my black community, lets go

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I twist the cap off the bottle, 
Take a sip and see tomorrow, like pac, 
Wash away the sorrow while police hit the block, I be up all night, 
Askin' god for the truth, 
He told me thinking translated in my own words in the booth, 
Try to reach the youth, 
Cause thats what matters today, 
I'm ain't too religious but I get on my knees and pray, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
I ain't gotta wonder no more, 
My people rollin' with me, yeah

And I miss your touch.
Cause no one could ever no, love me the way you do.

I need you in my life.
No one could compare to you.

I'm so confused.
Don't know if I'm losing you. (Don't know if I'm losing you, oh)
I'm so confused. (Oh)
Don't know if I'm losing you. (Baby)

Being afraid before, no.

Anthony Hamilton,"I love you
I love you

You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
(I know it ain't easy)
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you 
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Give it up for my lil? baby girl, she the only one in my world.
She?s the only one who really loves me, I can tell when she comes and hugs me..
Give up for my lil? baby boy, the only one that brings me joy,
Me and him ride like were best friends, Me & my lil? man till the end
1st Verse
It was so crazy what I came through, the headaches and drama were not cool,
I always thought, that having a baby would change everything yeah.
Don?t know why I was in and out of courtrooms, cause I was more than responsible I came through.
If I had to rewind it?all I would not change anything?

Some people care bout? things they own, more than there kids who have no clothes,
Some lie and cheat and some are true, just ask yourself which one are you.
2nd Verse
My baby loves me unconditional, but the love from a stranger has come and gone?
Gotta do what?s right, make sure that they come first over everything yeah?
How do you look in a kids eyes, they look just like you but you still deny?
You?re gonna regret it, missing the first breath, first steps, you can?t get em? back
If I was low, if I couldn?t cope, If I was broke, yeah?
You?d be right there beside me helping me up you would not deny me?
If I was low, if I couldn?t cope, If I was broke, yeah?
You?d be the one to build me up when I?m giving up..

Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome

Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you,
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

I'm lucky, I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home

I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living
Someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me...

Could've shared with you

Anthony Hamilton,"Sitting here, guess I didn' make bail 
Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing 
Fronting in the hood, trying to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle 

Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk to work 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Wasn' really looking guess I found it 
Five foot three light brown skinned 
Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady 

Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times ain't what they seem to be 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times would get the best of me 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Well, tried to be good (I tried, I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't want to die young 
Steady hustling trying to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids and like daddy did 
'Cause I'm so scared of failing 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little louder 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost out of touch 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little to much 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I get a little scared

Anthony Hamilton,"Young man, thirteen, running the streets
Living his dreams of being Nino Brown,
And a grandmother, who pleaded the 5th
A baby brother, who needed him
His little sister, believed in him
He needs to slow down
Then what happened next is something we see on a movie screen
Then his days as a nigga came to an end
Police found him in a pool of blood, clinging onto life
That boy looked up and he said/

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Young girl, sixteen, running
The same streets, living her dream of being Foxy Brown
And her teacher who, tested her
And an uncle who, molested her
Heavenly father still, blessing her
She just chose to play around
Then, the pain was just too much
Then, we are just living today and dying tomorrow
Said a prayer,
Then closed her eyes
Nodded slowly, then said wait God before I go
Tell my mama that I'm

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Somethings you can't
Somethings will never be the same

We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life
It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak
Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach deep
Deep down in our beings

Should I break or retreat and then return
Facing the fear that the truth, I discover

And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

I know all too well it don’t come easy
The chains of the world they seem to movin' tight
I try to walk around if I’m stumbling so come
Tryin' to get up but the doubt is so strong
There’s gotta be a winning in my bones

I’m looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, cost me everything I have
Well I’m looking for freedom, I’m looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

Oh not giving up there’s always been hard, so hard
But if I do the thanks lase the way I won’t get far.

Mhm, life hasn’t been very kind to me lately, (Well)
But I suppose it’s a push from moving on (Oh yeah)
In time the sun’s gonna shine on me nicely (On me yeah )

In danger's face

You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out

It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood, we can thug
And get out of hand, what's the options?
Only conclusion is shooting bullets, poppin'
Hoodlums dropping, fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what's my purpose
In the back of a patty wagon, bracelets, aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me

Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire he has everything but a fam guess
How angry this man gets, had so many bad chicks in his bed
Strange sex, same sex, has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits, he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he's into bestiality porn, and it's wrong
So I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong, but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes, and these fiends needs to get high, so they find dough
To mainline dope, and ya'll know

I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life that's women, that's cars
Cigars, in Venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate, cause he's newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application, 'cause they only medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation, calling up his travel agent
Same time, premeditating murdering his ex wife
Life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax, just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restrainin'

The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world

Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh

See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no)",Never Surrender,2013
Anthony Hamilton,"As around the sun the earth know she's revolving
And the rose buds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate know love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing we'll grow older everyday
Just as all that's born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way you pay
Did you know that life is giving love a guarantee
To last through forever, another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today i know I'm living for tomorrow
Could make me past, but that I musn't fear
For I know deep in my mind, the love of me I left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes a day (always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (always)
Until the day that 8×8×8 is 4 (always)
Until the day is the day there are no more

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (always)
Until the earth just fall, the sun ignites itself (always)
Until dear mother nature says our work is through (always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you

And all them roadblocks I walk right through
I do it for the ones like me
And all people who are just like you
No matter what they say about me
I'mma do whatever I gotta do

This is the come up
Where niggas hustle from night to sun up
The gutta, where niggas run up and they get done up
And mama tryna make a dollar for son and daughter
Where them times are even harder without a father
Want a job but never bother
All about them commas, bigger diamonds and high designer
With all the finest women, goddess
With perfect bodies that we admire
This is the come up where niggas do whatever for money
They'll murk a nigga now and got to church on a Sunday
Probably snitch on homeboys and take a flight out of country
It's fucked up, the motive is to get out the hood
Get your mama new crib, keep your family good
When that money is pouring and them jewels is shining
And them cars are foreigns, them haters praying it storm
It's no love, it ain't a place for the weak
Only strong survive, only hustlers ride

Where niggas hustle from night to sun up
And dreams are never seen, 'cause they don't believe in it.
And it seems you can achieve by any means go and get it
Anything you vision and anything you wishing
You can live it just bare the witness
They said i wouldn't and i did it
What God intended
From being labelled as a menace, to counting millions
My daughter smiling every minute, I'm in attendance oh lord
I got my deal in the field, cried hundred of tears
Feeling like that dough boy who hit a lick for a mill
Riding round with that work
Know them weapons concealed
If them feds ever catch 'em
He'll do 200 hundred years for that dope
And I know money come money go in the fame in the game
All the hate that it brings many lost some gave never changed
Not me, gotta survive everyday
Know every morning I wake I'm tryna come up

Fuelled by the passion and pain
And all the bullshit that I've been through
Still I hold my head up high
And all them roadblocks I walk right through
I do it for the ones like me
And all people who are just like you

Keep your head above the clouds
And your eyes on the prize

Mediums, moguls and spreaders of the falseness

Nothin is sacred in a dead economy
So bury me deap where the haters will never bother me

Disorted in sick shit

Musical ducktape
To patch the holes in your spirt
No jump on fate

I'm walking up to the jail, all the niggas start repping
Beating on glass, kicking the doors, and shit
So when I walk through the door, the captain tell me you can't come in here
Ok, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block I heard it all the way from down the hallway
My nigga had on yellow Balenciagas, ha ha ha

Dreaming of things we can't afford
But now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now
I bet they say, ""He put his niggas on""
Now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh

Corners wanna check him like Odell Beckham
I could play a record or just draw the weapon
She know I'm living reckless looking at my necklace
I'mma blow this forty on me, you can save the lectures
Homicides rise as the sun falls
Watch your dog die as my gun bark
These helicopters rise for the one in charge
If I sentence you to die well that's a hundred shots
Judge banging like a blood, show a nigga love
Caught him with a kilo so he hit him with a dub
We bulletproof the trucks like the ones in Iraq
Where I'm at you lock your door and you using a latch
Now it's stones on my hands, Roberto Durans
Stood tall in the feds, don't fold on the fam
Tryna point me to the money, no holding my hand
Somebody take me to the bank 'cause it open at ten

Poverty stricken, boy you gotta be kidding
Living like we hit the lottery nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident
All these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stoping it
Get off my dick nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that, real nigga roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talking to the law, knowing that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Bennie Boom
Started out with nothing, now a nigga in a room
Sweeping rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers nigga, I could never lose

I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
Oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors

I seen this years ago
Picasso on the wall

Like Lamborghini doors

Paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You banging on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm stepping through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rolling a wood leaf
Phone ringing, smiling like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick in NBC out on the NorthEast
Such a feeling, niggas killing for my poetry
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your wedding vows
I still be making rounds like I'm Kevin Liles
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me stepping out

Started off poor with plans to own more
To riding under stars, the life we lived for
Dreaming of things we can't afford

Shine- lake of fire
Lines take me higher

Confined and overtired

Is getting me nowhere
I can't shake this charade

HomeIt's what I long for

Sorrow- eternity

Could carry on with this life

Get her drunk first

Them other bitches hit 'em I don't buy 'em lunch first
Just hard dick and bubblegum, and maybe one purse, for the fun girls
And some lean and some loose ones for the young girls

Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Ha ha, yeah

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel

You know, pop goes the weasel
For years, I've wondered
What that meant
And nobody seemed to know

So, I looked it up
And the official explanation
Goes something like this

Pop goes the weasel refers to
The habit of London hatters long ago
Popping or pawning their weasels
Or accessories on Saturday night
To buy liquor, isn't that interesting

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

But you know
I've got a theory of my own
About pop goes the weasel
It's much simpler

Why did the weasel go pop, go pop
Pop, pop goes the weasel
Why did the weasel go pop
'Cause they upped the price
Of tuppeny rice to four pence

How did the pop get into the weasel
Weasel, pop goes the weasel
How did the pop get in there
Well, the weasel caught his
Beakle in the treacle

Now, if you've got a weasel
And you don't want him to pop
The next time you go shopping
Don't you take him in the shop
Two, three, four

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now that is the way
That the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's sitting on the table
Now I take a stick
And I knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Together now

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now, I mix it up
And I make it nice

I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends.

 See, the days grown long 
Winter comes upon us 
Like a storm at sea. 
And the will to live  
Seems a little thin sometimes 
When those you love are 
Lost beneath the snowfall.

So we share our cup 
With the thirsty fawn of life 
Who leaves us on the  
Highway without water.

Master of Time, let me try once again 
And I will give more, oh how I'll try, 
And with this, a new life I'll buy.

Far away, she knows 
That her love will be, 
And she nestles down, 
Sobbing still, she dries her eyes, 
Knowing that the world 
Will cry the rest out. 
  
Where did beauty go? 
Seek it here, there 
But it's slipped away. 
And when they come to lay me down, 
I will take your memory too, 
They'll know that in my final hour, 
I loved you.

Anthony Phillips,"I hear the birds come greet me in my morning,
They sing the songs of love in tongues of ages past,
And all the while a vision is unfolding,
The Moorhen pipes at me, ""don't sleep the day away"".
And so with cautious steps I tread
A measured path through vale and rook,
And many signs you'd want to take me with you.
And I go down to the Landing,
Heron's Flood flows on storm-clothed
As the harbour lights guide the wanderers home.
I see the sun come greet me in his dawning,
He holds the seed of life within his aged hands.
And, in the sky, a vast procession streaming,
Royal banners held aloft to mark the halcyon time.
And so I walk in meads below,
Amongst the springs and weevil-gall,
In myriad throngs the grass will take me with you.
And I climb up to the Hawk's Throne,
Cragshorn lies at Umbrian
And the marram-slopes span the sapient sky.
I feel the night come bidding me his greeting,
He draws a glowing veil upon a sleepy world.
And in the sky the stars roll through the heavens,
Below, the new-hatched dove stares wondrously above.
And so to Esma I am come
To forge a passageway through time
And all, too soon, you'd come to take me with you.
And I strike north to the veldt-plains,
Dorn Ridge melts in snow-gold.
As the Moorhen
Pipes the pinkery moon.

Standing by a harbour soaking rain,
Why must the sky bring rain back again?
Wake, an angel talking,
She's asking ""black, white or nun?""
Drake, from Plymouth streaking,
He sinks the galleons with the guns.
Climbing up a creeper chasing flies,
Unzip their wings and look in their eyes;
Standing on a steeple stitching time
Time to be saved and time to be nine.
Footsteps in a blizzard point the way to go

Anthony Phillips,"Where we are, it's very lonely
There we are, oh God if only
Either one of us would go away
Where we are, is next to nowhere

Even the highway just hates to go there
Nothing in the world could make it stay
Why do we sit here in misery
Is it democracy or just insane?

Speaking financially, it looks like rain:
And you say ""boy, you better be nice to me
 
I'll take what is coming to you
I'll take all the property too""

Fading surely, you are returning,

And acts with perfect sobriety
I said 'Hey, you, up in the clouds
 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
Call the airforce, call the C.I.A.
She won't escape this time
Taking off for ten weeks on the Nile
The nights will be rich with mystery
Johnny's swimming with the crocodiles
But he's gonna teach her some history
I said 'Hey, you, up in the clouds
 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
He's in the gym, he's on the driving range
She won't escape this time",Sally,1984
Anthony Phillips Band,"The girl in the gallery,
The way she moves her hair,
Footsteps in the Autumn leaves,
Turning and finding no-one there
Traces of you in the morning light
Traces of you in the night
You're haunting me still
I don't even have to try
I always find those...
Traces of you all around my life
Traces of you like a Knife
Twisting inside my heart
You're tearing my world apart
Don't torture me
The ring of the telephone
The quizzical hello
The glass in my hand shaking
Lying shattered in the snow
I saw a face in a picture show
Those Alborado eyes calling me
I see trees, I see indigo
I can't keep up this disguise",Traces,1984
Anthony Phillips Band,"They saw the flags, it didn't look so bad
they heard the news and how we could not lose
And they sang with the marching band
The sailors' wives with anxious eyes
But it impressed them too
They even cheered up as the ships pulled clear
And though it was no-one's fault
That men went off to war
I saw a thousand faces all along the shore...
The women were watching
So no-one thought of turning back
He didn't fight for his country's pride
His life was sold 'cause it was better than the dole
He even waved as they sent him away
But something's changed - no this is not a game
She held his hand and it was cold and damp
She couldn't hide from the feelings inside
'Cause in the storm the night before
She heard him calling... goodbye goodbye goodbye
Won't you give me a smile
I could be gone for a long long while
And though it was no-one's fault
That he had to go to war
Among a thousand faces all along the shore
A woman was watching
He never thought of turning back",The Women Were Watching,1984

When compassion dies
No stocking, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net

No loose change, no change, no
Santa Claus is coming
'Cause Santa Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again
Well, maybe next year or when

December twenty-fourth, ten p.m.
Eastern standard time
I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see, what we have time to see

Turn the projector on first shot roger
With the fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

I found my song
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi
I tried you know I tried

Who's still in the dark
But he's got great footage
Which he's cut together

To screen tonight
In honor of Benny's wife
Muffy, Alison
Pulling Benny out of the east village location

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight
I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?
Maybe a bird told her or an angel
I had a little hunch you could use, a little 'flow

Tutoring again? Negative
Back at you? No, no you, no
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code

The code, well

Yet robin hooding isn't the solution
The powers that be must be undermined

Where we overcharge the wealthy, clientÃ¨le

With a private corner banquette in the back
We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe

But you'd miss New York before you could unpack
Mark, Roger, anyone? Help
Maureen?
It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark
And she was freezing and begged to come here
Over here, oh, god
Got a light, I know you, you're shivering

She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on mimi, me, me

Hello-911? I'm on hold
Cold, cold, would you light my candle
Yes, we'll, oh God, find a candle

I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you

I should tell you

I should tell you why I left
It wasn't, 'cause I didn't

I know, I should tell you
I should tell you

My destiny (will someone care)
I trust my soul (will I wake tomorrow)

Anthony Rapp,"It's true you sold your guitar and bought a car?
It's true, I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true, you're with this yuppie scum?
You said you'd never speak to him again

Not now
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?
We used to have this fight each night (calm down)
She'd never admit I existed (everyone please)

He was the same way
He was always, run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

She's in denial (He's in denial)
Don't give an inch
When I gave a mile (come on)
I gave a mile
Gave a mile to who?
Come on guys, chill

I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had
Someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you
All your words are nice, Mimi
But love's not a three way street
You'll never share real love
Until you love yourself, I should know
You all said you'd be cool today
So please, for my sake

I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
I can't believe this is goodbye

I hear there are great restaurants out west
Some of the best, how could she?
How could you let her go?
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?
Maybe you'll see why when you stop escaping your pain

At least now if you try, Angel's death won't be in vain
His death is in vain
Are you insane?
There's so much to care about

There's me, there's Mimi
Mimi's got her baggage too
So do you
Who are you to tell me what I know
What to do
A friend

But who, Mark, are you?
Mark has got his work
They say, ""Mark lives for his work""
And, ""Mark's in love with his work""
Mark hides in his work

But from what?
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

And you're running out the door
No more, I've gotta go
Hey, for somebody who's always been let down who's heading out of town?
For someone who longs for a community of his own
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call, I hate the fall
You heard?
Every word

You don't want baggage without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die?
I just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love

Came to say goodbye love, goodbye
Just came to say goodbye love (glory) 
Goodbye love (one blaze of)
Goodbye love
I have to find

Please don't touch me, understand
I'm scared, I need to go away
I know a place, a clinic
A rehab?
Maybe, could you?
I'll pay

How the hell, Pan left, close on the steeple of the church
How did I get here?
How the hell, Christmas, Christmas Eve, last year

How could a night so frozen
Be so scalding hot?
How can a morning this mild
Be so raw?

Why are entire years strewn
On the cutting room floor of memories?
When single frames from one magic night
Forever flicker in close-up on the 3-D Imax of my mind

That's poetic, that's pathetic
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door
And Collins choose that phone booth
Back where Angel set up his drums?

For once the shadows gave way to light

For once I didn't disengage

For all of this heartache and pain I've been feelin'
Since she let me go, I wanna know

Blaze a trail though the woods in my four wheel drive
With a team of horses or an old John Deere, I can plow this land
But if I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man

I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn
If I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man

I could build a fire, usin' nothin' but a stick
If I put my mind to it, there ain't much I can't fix
I can read and count, I can figure things out if you give me a chance
But if I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man

Where she grew up there ain't no roads
Out in the sticks where the ginsing grows

She float down the river to get to school
Then her daddy come get her on a ole pack mule

She runs back and forth from shed to shack
Checking on the moonshine brewing out back

If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

(Chorus)

She got a bible, she's born again
She got a shotgun, she ain't afraid of sin
She's got rebel rising routy friends singing oohhh ohh ohhh

She got a Trans Am with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows, and Dixie Chicks
She goes honky tonking just for kicks

Took the stop sign down it was shot up anyhow
One night, I ran right through it in my Chevrolet
Both police cars came but I got away

It was a boom town back in '62 'til the coal ran out and a dry came through
When they damned the river, we all used to fish
Population 4O5 and I'm 84 O419, I left a city limit sign layin' in the ditch
Run blown over it, deep in metropolis

Well, I found myself in a big high rise with a concrete yard
It ain't safe after dark, guess, this ol' boy drove too far
Met a girl fell in love, got married and she's due in May
Say's, we're gonna need more space by sayin' I know just the place

Where we can walk down to the country store
And we won't even have to lock our doors
And you can still get air and water there for free

Will a little more love
Bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right
Will a little more love make it right.

How, how was a young girl to know

In the warmth of your arms
In the web of your lies.

We stayed out till 10 o'clock

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Anthony Wonsey,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade In Blue,

My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason

That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true

That they do
They do come true

Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true

Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable

Will find

Too soon, too soon.

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

It is seldom that a dream comes true

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Seven years ago we wrote this one
Like ernest and julio, before it's time
Sever years later and it's holding up fine
Stupid motherf*ckers like to slug us and dis
But there was no bandwagon when we wrote this
'cause we stretched our boundaries
We opened the door
That no one attempted before
Five guys in shorts, who gives a shit
We do what we like, we don't care where we fit
All you new jacks, what is it?
You're kidding me, get off our dicks

Now we're anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your pop-tarts like I stole your
(psych!)
Beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing harder's the smell of my feet
So listen up close or you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a piss...
Watch the beat

I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step off sucker understand
Don't you know
I'm the man

We got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
If ya think we've got egos well we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frankie's never on time he's always...
Drinking the drinks, the drinks I drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning...
Point, point, point, point, and watch the beat

For a heavy metal band raps a different way
But we like to be different and not cliche
Well they say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...(dicks)
Fart the farts the farts he farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarded
Like el duce says ""smell my anal vapor""
And wipe my butt, with your fuckin' face
You stupid idiot...

Sooooooo, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see I forgot my hat
You know anthrax is number one
But we don't care we just wanna have...(party)

We are the kings and all shall buff

And will remain the hardest ever!

An action from reaction and you can't make a retraction

And then you're blue in the face,
As you try to state your case
You can think with your dick but it can't shout
Yo

I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists, say you want your own state
I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness

Discrimination, through the nation, raining hatred
I yell, when there's schism you must rebel
I yell, so you'll hear
I yell, I refuse to live in your hell
I am what you fear
I'm the truth, I don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else

You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the, keep it in the, keep it in the
Family
Don't even try to tell me what you think is right
When to you blacks are niggers, and jews are kikes
And you expect to be taken seriously
But your actions, they're more than curiously.
Juvenile, you emulate what you hate
And you don't even know why you feel this way
'cause daddy hated this, and mommy hated that
And your own ability to reason's like a tire gone flat

Underneath it I'm human

Have my cake and then

He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice

Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge dredd the man, he is the law

And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even death can overcome his might
Cause dredd and anderson, they won the fight
When the sov's started the apocalypse war
Mega-city was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought back
Crushed the sov's with their counter-attack

Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...

In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red

And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his law-giver

Antibalas
Jovanotti in the street

Ho un battito DI cuore così forte
Che copre tutti gli altri rumori
MI dice vieni fuori
Mi grida vieni fuori
Ho cercato DI capirci qualcosa
Ascoltando migliaia DI opinioni
Ma mi sembra che nemmeno gli esperti
Sappiano fare previsioni
A forza di dire domani
Quel domani è arrivato fino a qui
E mi ha colto DI sorpresa
Ma ho già pronto un piano B
Entrerò nel tuo labirinto
Guarderò in faccia la medusa
Piuttosto che restare fermo qua
Ad inventarmi qualche scusa
Potrei girare un kolossal
Con scene da brivido e poi
Un lieto fine rassicurante
Come piace a Hollywood

Ma ora che sono qui
Melagioco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto

Se provi ad ammazzare il tempo
Devi avere una mira perfetta
Perché se lo ferisci e basta
Poi scatta la vendetta
Il mattino ha l'oro in bocca
Se la sera ha in bocca un bacio
Non fermarti a parlare con nessuno
Quando sei al prossimo incrocio
MI hanno detto per suonare la chitarra
Può servire anche un corso DI cucina
La città dove vorresti vivere
Non la trovi nella cartina
Ma nella valle tra il collo e le spalle
Della donna che ti sorride
Aspettala fuori dal bar
Stanotte quando chiude
Potrei girare un musical
Con balletti da brivido
E un lieto fine rassicurante
Come piace ad Hollywood

Ma ora che sono qui io
Melagioco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
Salto attraverso il fuoco
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto

Oh, yeah

Make a move, make a move
With the rotting groove
Antibalas, make a move, Jovanotti's groove
Potrei desiderare la roba d'altri
La donna d'altri
Truccare appalti
Far quattro salti dalla padella alla brace
Per far bella figura far quello che non mi piace
Fare indigestione di bocconi amari
Dare via la libertà in cambio di favori
Annusare la merda e poi dire profuma di fiori, buona! 
Essere mimetico dentro dentro al contesto
Lentamente omologarmi al resto
Fantastico, mistico, plastico, ritmico,
Mi faccio questo viaggio, niente di turistico
Prendo quel che viene, cerco di capire
Non rinuncio ad alzarmi ad andare
Verso quel posto che si sposta quando io mi sposto
La meta che scompare quando mi ci accosto
Tengo teso il filo, straripo come il Nilo
Non vendo la mia vita un tanto al kilo
Non scrivo con la stilo ma col sangue delle vene
Un misto di ambizione e vocazione
Fedele alla potenza dell'immaginazione

They figured you out
They know your routine

I buried myself half alive
But I'm seeking truth, higher ground
I'm humbled when I make
An honest mistake

And heavy hand

It was cold September wind that blew

I think its best that way
Can't be held responsible for what you didn't say

It's a longshot, but a chance I've got to take

It's fair to mention from the first that
When you touched me there
You're starting something that I'll finish
So just be aware
And if you mention one more time we
Could be soul mates I'll die
It's easy now when I look back, they
Call that ""retrospect""

Such a ripple effect
I might've been more likely just to let 
That sleeping dog lie

My fighting words are nearly gone
There's something sliding down my leg

I foresaw the day when you would come
And make it clear
Some things do better where you found
Them so we'll just leave it here
I'm only crying cause this cloud of
Smoke is burning my eyes
And ever since the times when I am 
Standing close to you
I see the person that you are
The one I never knew
Do you ever feel me or are you too high
Ready get set here we go
What's been going on? I don't know

On the girl who wouldn't stand out in a crowd
She was born to the son of a mini van salesman
On an early August morning under clouds

Sweet romance, like her dreams
Came in Spinster Magazine
Her romeo was on page 33

He buys her diamond rings, he's always listening
He tells her everything
All those things that a girl would ever want to hear
But that's not truly love Rosita dear

On a plane bags are packed with the bell jar on her lap
And a half devoured Harlequin novella
You are much much too young to be leaving with no one
But Fabio in tight jeans

He'll give her Mexico tied up in a bow
And all the girls she knows green with envy
Wishing they met one as cavalier
But that's not truly love Rosita dear

Oh there was a time you gave
Your heart and soul away
Now, all that you give is up
Don't lose the love you save

See the beauty and happyness wises

Antiskeptic,"And he dreams
Another atmosphere
Evaporated fear
A place inside that he dreams and knows too well

Letting go
A new reality
The light reflecting in
Revealing lock and key
Inside his prison cell

It's a dream he often fails to tell
School is way too ordinary for him
The reason is for change inward self
But it will never go away

And he dreams
A place of barrenness
Echoing emptiness
The thought deniable but finds it clear and well

Letting go
Token of clarity
Transact the memory
Holding the docket of the time that he let go

Letting go, of hopelessness
I'm breathing in and out your emptiness
And i sighed i'm so misunderstood
Well i know you're leaving

I can't believe that

Not your patch it's a car park
Juveniles on my land go clear off
Here again it's picture
Social order is weighed off
Up against the faces of the young for all I know
So you're young
Well that's alright
No mater who you are
(Don't believe that there's nothing to say nothing to say)
Woke today another story
Visions are all but faded
Yesteryear, all that's been it's not your fault
Congregate another victim
Realize the inner sanctum
Make our mark stake our claim for all we are

Antje Duvekot,"Someone is tossing petals in a stream
Somewhere someone is standing at the foothills of their dreams
Someone got a paintbrush, is painting over doubts
Someone opened up his eyes and saw the sun coming out
Someone was captive and found the courage to get off
From a boulder in the well, somewhere the rain has stopped
Someone is finding the place where they belong

Everyday is summer somewhere in the world
And the summer boys are headed for the falls to kiss the girls
With their impatient hands groping honey breasts and curls
They are filled with desire
And high in the hills there's a baby being born
As forgiveness and peace wash over bruises and sores
People bridging the distance over nettles and thorns

Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
Some things will rise up so that others come down
If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
If the facuet is tightened up the love won't flow
If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow

A rich man counting money, a tired man counting sheep
While the safe man counts his blessings, the hungry man has beans
There's a million people praying, raising up their eyes
To what turns out to be the same god, the same sky
We are slightly scared of death, a little bit afraid
So we celebrate everything we can think to celebrate
We shall sing out loud to keep the hounds away

Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
Some things will rise up so that others come down
If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
If the facuet is tightened up the love won't flow
If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow

Prisons will crumble and governments will fall
It's the order of freedom to be preceded by walls
Cause the truth would be worthless if no one ever lied
So we carry our shame in the interest of pride
And we have all these questions to make us go roam
And we've got all this distance to make us come home
As the sun burns, a child learns, the tide churns, the world turns

Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
Some things will rise up so that others come down
If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line

Antje Duvekot,"Well you floated in on a helium balloon 
Out of your fishbowl and into the fire 
First you sung her praises, drunk on her glow 
Then you cursed her name when you lost control 

Well you floated in on a cotton candy cloud 
Out of your desert and into the flood 
But the cobblestone mud seeped into your crown 
Oh, the silent crowd could melt you down 

I rode in on you into this city 
I'll ride out on you if everything falls 
I rode in on the rhythm of a Greyhound guitar 
With the pulse being kept by the rain

Well I heard your voice as the tiles gave way 
And the third rail came into view 
On an upbound round of a downtown train 
And anyone can take a piece of you 

And I can't help but wonder as the faces roll past 
Did she leave anything behind? 
I stare for a moment from behind the glass 
Drowned out by the train engine's whine 

I rode in on you into this city 
I'll ride out on you if everything falls 
I rode in on the rhythm of a Greyhound guitar 
With the pulse being kept by the rain 

Neon moondust shines in Times Square 
The pulse of the alleys echoing 
In a cab going downtown, I am found, New York 

I rode in on you into this city 
I'll ride out on you if everything falls 
I rode in on the rhythm of a Greyhound guitar 
With the pulse being kept by the rain",Into the City,2003
Antje Duvekot,"You are a rollercoaster 
You make the ladies weak 
You are a rocketship 
Come from another galaxy 
Yeah, you are pure desire 
Like a candy bar at a fat camp 
If I cannot have you now 
I will wither like a weed 

You are a glass of fine wine 
With a four star dish 
You are a little detour 
Make me shake like a jellyfish 
You could do my laundry 
Won't you make me cum?
You are like opium 

You look like a centaur 
Riding on that bike 
Rock star, with your guitar 
Play me the soundtrack to my life 
And tell me a story, I don't care if it is true 
I only wanna see your lips move 

If I were a country I'd let you explore me 
You could draw a map 
Then show me all my peaks 
If I were a car I would let you repair me 
And jump start my battery 
You have the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
I would offer you a permanent position in my dreams 
And it's not that I'm easily swept off my feet 
But you are like ecstacy 

You are a roller coaster 
You make the ladies weak 
You are a rocketship 
Come from another galaxy 
You are a hurricane 
Walking down that lane 

Oh, you make a woman blush, boy 
When you look at her that way 
Cause you are like opium 
Yeah, you are like opium",Opium,2003
Antje Duvekot,"You've been following your compass
Putting in your two cents
Still feel like you're walking in a shoe box
Mapping out a dead end

In the uncharted countries
Out on ecstasy's borders
You have seen the reflections

There's laughter in your cities
Light bulbs in your attics
Stand against the darkness of the outback
The darkness of the road
In the depths of your dreaming
In the cracks in the ceiling
You have seen the revealing

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if your great walls remained
As little more than cellophane
At the end of the day?

When you move out
Of the desert everything changes
Back then you had no regard
For all that you came with
Now the sun is setting
On the unmoved faces
Of your own congregation

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if your great walls remained
As little more than cellophane
At the end of the day?

Still no rockabye
Sing out your lullaby
Cause you will never know why
Your truth is your brother's lie

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if all your matches
Burn down to your fingertips

Without ever lighting a fire?
What if your great walls remained
As little more than cellophane
At the end of the end of the
End of the day?

Antje Duvekot,"The dusk it has fallen, the comet has crashed
The stolen statues have lost their heads
The great wall of china is melting in the rain
Stacks of words are burning like Pompei

The fog in our bedroom was thicker than before
I called your name and it felt like war
And we ran with our shoes off to the pavement's end
To the place of our birth at the end of the earth

Helpless kiss, I'm rudderless
How do you intend to unbreak this?
We're a paper fleet in an arctic freeze
On the skin of an endless open sea

In boxes in the basement, we buried our hurt
We were keeping score, we were saving our words
We touched like flowers, frozen in wreaths
We fell like stones, we were running in our sleep

Helpless kiss, I'm rudderless
How do you intend to unbreak this?
We're a paper fleet in an arctic freeze
On the skin of an endless open sea

Happy endings are dependent on where the film is cut
Noah's Ark and the Titanic are different scenes of the same plot
I will not tear apart your photo, I will not desecrate your grave
Because I know they are not responsible for the time when they were made

Helpless kiss, I'm rudderless
How do you intend to unbreak this?
You're a paper fleet in an arctic freeze

Antje Duvekot,"When your heart is bent to weigh down a train 
Hold on 
When your soul is shipwrecked and you?re miles away 
Hold on 
When your fortress is an eggshell 
Full of haunted cracks you cannot weld 

There's no mercy sleep under stolen sheets 
In a stillborn dream when your tank is empty 
When your path is dark and your compass gone When your map is torn, torn 
And all your life you never thought you'd end here 
Hold on 
And all the glass is in pieces and the maids are in tears 
Hold on 
Now you're waiting for a rescue 
But no snow white horse shows up for you

There's no mercy sleep under stolen sheets 
In a stillborn dream when your tank is empty 
When your path is dark and your compass gone
When your map is torn, torn 
Minefield crossroads, watch the time flow
Crossless martyrs, just gets harder 
Voiceless whisper, tongue played twister 
Mirror, mirror, wish you were here 

There's no mercy sleep under stolen sheets 
In a stillborn dream when your tank is empty 
When your path is dark, and your compass gone
When your map is torn, torn 
There's no mercy sleep under stolen sheets 
In a stillborn dream when your tank is empty 
When your path is dark, and your compass gone 
When your map is torn, torn",Hold On,2006
Antje Duvekot,"So, a city wakes up in the morning
And all the infidels get in their cars
As a father is floating, ?
And driven into your heart

'Cause you live in a town that is delicate
Where old grudges run deeper than mud
Where peace is a term that is relative
And written in blood

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem

Another city wakes up in the morning
You are the martyr who is taking the stage
You're laying flowers on the eyes of your brother
In his funeral parade

And you are filled with a love for your people
All your life you have drunk bitter milk

You say, ""The ones who have wounded my brother
Are the ones I must kill""

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem

Now the blood has run down to a stand
For generations, it's marked up the sand
Where the scars are as deep as the rivers
And as old as the land

Your god's armies, they are marching on heaven
In the name of what is holy and sacred
Casting poisonous seeds for their children to reap
Out of the rubbles of hatred

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem",Jerusalem,2006
