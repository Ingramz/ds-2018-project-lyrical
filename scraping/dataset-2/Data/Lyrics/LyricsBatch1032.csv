Niggas (what?)
Would you ride for the cause? (hell yeah!)
Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler see-Murder and bring bitches to their knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home
ain't No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Chorus]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders 
We TRU niggas
We riders
We real niggas
We riders
We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas want to ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan be	 and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

[C Murder] 
Yeah check this shit out. This is for all my real tank dogs 
My No Limit soldiers out there buying my shit 
Ya know this is for you you hear me? 
Show me love 
When you see me on the TV show me love 
On the video 
I got a tank around my chest representing my home 
I'm asking all the haters to leave me alone 
And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats 
And my success goes to the man above 
But uh, I'd like to thank my fans for showing me love 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the southside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the northside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the eastside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the westside 
[Mac] 
When I was underground everybody down 
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground 
With those niggas that was broke they laughed and joked 
Them niggas was broke too but I'm a rapper so they think I'm not 
supposed to 
But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name 
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight 
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way 
y'all niggas don't know, I got so much shit I won't say 
I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words 
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga 
Ya heard me, to all my niggas on the southside 
Show me love 
Ya heard me, all my niggas on the northside 
Show me love 
Show a nigga some love nigga 
On the eastside 
Show me love 
And all my niggas on the westside 
[Mr. Serv-On] 
It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face 
Love from my tombstone try to relocate 
But in my tank lord I got faith 
Five hundred dollars or so for my block 
Lord knows I couldn't stop 
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks 
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down 
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside 
I ride with jack time ballers 
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers 
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet 
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA 
The thirties in the Bay, brown love for my esses 
That's a long damn way from the parkway 
So when I'm home, see a nigga drop a nigga from above 
(Cmon, cmon) Show me love 
To all my niggas on the westside 
To all my niggas on the eastside 
To all my niggas on the northside 
To all my niggas on the southside 
To all my bangers on the westside 
To all my bangers on the eastside 
To all my bangers on the northside",Show Me Luv,2013

Soulja Slim,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

Souljahz,"I'ma start with the definition of real hip hop and true raps expression
Inner soul and beliefs through 4 A dat's
Or should I say 32 tracks of inner artifacts
From the heart the pressure just might arrest my cardiac

And perhaps it snaps some back if I don't cut it some slack
Release the spirit that be spittin' these lyrics, you can't react
There is no come back for those who come wack
Leave you shook with a hook from the Holy book for combat

Now what? You wanna battle me? It's ain't what it seems
You ain't up against the odds of me
You up against the odds of the Most High
Supreme Being

You took a turn for the worst and got cursed
You mess with a child of Jah
You deal with God first
'Round the earth and sea

Never fake or underestimate the power of the enemy
'Cause just when you think you got the devil out your vicinity
He snipes you from the roof and takes you out like he did Kennedy
And splatter your dreams all over the wall, laugh as you fall

Cut you off in the knees and make it hard to stand tall
And in the midst of it all, he got the gall to say no hope
So to cope you call a psychic and review your horoscope
You know what I call a horoscope? Exactly what it means
A scope into the horror of reality's bad dreams

They make it out to be
What it doesn't seem
Just to change it back to way it is
Nothing' but lies, kid

Lemme hear ya say, aw, yeah

You be feelin' it deep in your soul
Tryna' deny that yo peachy world done lost control
We live and die in the dust that we came from
No matter where everybody sing the same song

We all brothers and when you hear the missiles soar
You hit the floor like war, war, still can't find out what it's good for
Absolutely nothin', we killin' like we cannibals
Runnin' over somethin'

You life's a never ending story, runnin' from the nothin'
Don't say I didn't warm you when you see it comin'
Hell fire, brimstone, takin' you home
Came from dust, went to flesh tone and now you gone

Back to dust so in God we trust, get on the bus
Before you leave here, you never know when your time is up
Like the night your clock strikes 12, you lost your shoe
Or the carriage took your shirt to hell, what you gon' do now?

Lemme hear ya say, aw, yeah
(Aw, yeah)

Walked in the door, I asked you before
What you here for? And you shook to the core
Walked on the floor like it was a chore
And then you asked, Lord can you bless me times 4?

Na, na, na, I can't handle it
If your gonna rock, man, please bring in the gentle
Can tell by your sentiment that you weren't even feelin' it
But then, oh but I didn't it

1, 2, look out for my crew
'Cause we be rockin like and nobody knew
From our heads to our shoes, gotta keep it true
Gotta keep it righteous to Him our praise is due

And we got the stuff to make ya head nod

Souljahz,"Why do you hit me?
You know I ain't your punchin' bag
Since when do thorns try to hurt the roses?
And why are you always mad?

Said I, I'm so innocent, and you're, you're so ignorant
Raise your fist, hit or miss
Try to take my happiness
Well, that ain't happenin' to me no more

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today, yeah
Said I know I'm gonna make it today

I woke up this mornin'
As I wiped the sleep from my eyes
Got a real good feelin', yeah
For the first time I had no reason to cry

So I said, ""My Father
Lord, thanks for the changin' my life
Lord, thanks for holdin' me, showin' me
What real love is like""

'Cause you're so true to me
So I try, try to be true to you
You love me when no one, no one even cared for me
So I can face the rain and smile again

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today, yeah
Said I know I'm gonna make it today

What's the bottle for, and why are you so mad?
I thought that mama said you're supposed to be our loving dad
But alcohol done took control of your life
Now you do the same and try to take control of your wife and kids
So I'ma speak for all the quiet and scared
Too afraid to stand 'cause they can't face their fears

Take a look in the mirror, MJ says, ""Change your ways to see clearer""
God says, ""There's always a way out
Ain't no temptation that ain't played out""
Since the beginnin' of time, Satan's been roamin' the earth
Trying to tempt the weak willed to hate and hurt

And since sins birth, I know your lives been hard
Need to stop beatin' us and start beatin' your problems
So today is when we stop the hurt
Get up, it's 10 o'clock, yo, we're goin' to church

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry

We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

'Things ain't always what it seems', Martin Luther King
Said it and while you hate you regret it
But the world will never change until you openly admit it
And look, [unverified] at the color of my sin and then you'll get it

Yo, what about the great American dream
Where all men are created equal
Was that a twisted plot for the sequel?
Sewing seeds of hate so that your kids inherit evil

And the wonder why your peachy
Neighborhood isn't so peaceful, ooh, let freedom ring
And shake the entire being of America's dream
Let it ring from mountaintops to valley lows

My rally grows stronger with my hunger
For this land of the free, home of the brave
Mentally enslaved, we lost everything that our forefathers gained Pain?
My race still decides it as states we're united and by hate we're divided

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

I ain't the first to paint this picture, reminisce on how my situation
Done got me thinkin' clear, oh my dear, baby
I'm sick of tryin' lately, y'all see me cryin' it's crazy
I thought we made it far from here, oh, oh, oh no
Forgive them Father for they don't know their problem's gone

Deeper than my skin, became king of the hole above their chin
Don't tell me nothin' 'cause I don't wanna hear it
God judges through your spirit, don't let your hate
See my color and dig my grave again

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

Many have died, their very lives a living sacrifice
But they all remembered, they all remembered, yeah, yeah
Instead of walkin' let's march, instead of words, let's speak heart
Who needs the sunlight, when freedom reigns?

Yo, she was such a dignified child
It been a long while since she seen a stranger smile
Just moved to New York and they all hate her 'cause she can dance
Who ever said, havin' rhythm means you gotta be tan

She was taught to be color blind but her ears could hear
And every time they talked about her, her heart shed a tear
Come on, y'all don't hear me what else can I say
Listen let me tell you in a different way

We fight, betray, we know the games we play
And I can't figure out the reason why tell me why, it kills me
We say we're grown but yet fight over skin tone
Instead of helping each other we'd rather help are own

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

Souljahz,"You don't know me, look into my eyes
You don't trust me, you'd rather die
Then to take my hand, lead me from this land
Of destruction and poverty, why don't you understand?

You don't see me, look into my soul
Can't believe me, I have nothing to show
But my legs and my arms and my feet and my ears
And my eyes and my hands, can't you see, I'm a man?

I am the poor man on the street and to the rich man
I'm a sinner, I'm a beggar and I'm a freak
Everyday you all just pass me by, can't you see me?
Please don't deny that I'm alive

Aye, yo, I roam all day and night alone
This cold pavement is my home away from home
Where I spend it, don't matter none
'Cause I'm left stranded but not the only one

'Cause there's a whole community of them
And me's that you stare at like we are the enemy and I swear
I don't mean no harm, I just wanna walk with ya
Don't mean no harm, I just wanna talk with ya

Tell me your name, I'll tell you mine
How you doin' today sir, I'm doin' fine
Now tell me, how that seem so hard
Easy to forget about me, when you forgot about God

So now I lay me down to sleep
I pray, dear God my soul You keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray, dear Lord my soul You take, You take

I am the poor man on the street and to the rich man
I'm a sinner, I'm a beggar and I'm a freak
Everyday you all just pass me by, can't you see me?
Please don't deny that I'm alive

Listen, it's a hard road and it's a hard game
To live the life of the man that has no name
And you point your fingers and laugh
Did you ever think where this man takes a bath?

Did you ever think when you called him a slob?
That it might be you in a year with no job
Yeah, he was livin' day to day a normal life just like yours
A job, house and a normal wife, just like yours

But never did he think or comprehend what was ahead
His stock dropped to zero, now he's better off dead
Then goes the house, back accounts and the Benz
Just when he needed 'em them the most, there goes his friends

Suicidal thoughts as the countdown begins
Puts the nine to his head it all comes to an end
About to pull the trigger as he takes his last breath
He remembers when he dies his kids inherit his debt

There's nothin' left, nowhere to run,
Puts down the gun, puts out his hand
Begs you for a dollar and you deny him again
Look him in the eye and deny him again, his name is poor man

You say you love God, but God says feed him and He'll feed me
So why deny me of the very thing I need
Don't want your money, no, at least have the decency
To look me in the eyes and not deny that I'm alive

He is the poor man on the street and to the rich man
He's a sinner, he's a beggar and he's a freak
Everyday you all just pass him by, can't you see him?
Please don't deny that he's alive

Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive

With no excuses for my shame
In a world that measures our success
By where we're at but not how we got there
I think we're sinking deeper everyday

If I had a dime for every tabloid mocking His return
I would be a millionaire, oh, and still they'd never learn
Use this fool to shame the wise
Remove the pride that blinds their eyes
Be my sail so I can drift way, oh Lord

But if my Father's the light than I inherit brightness
We all people, black, white or brown we all equal
Livin' the same world waiting for the sequel

I write what my heart speaks through my pen leaks
Lyrics that are obstacles to make us reach peaks
Like women, never put no man in place of God
'Cause then you're sinnin'
And you know how hard it is for us to repent, I've been sent
To tell y'all just exactly what God meant when he quoted scripture
Write it down take a picture, so you could take it witcha
And let my lyrics change you when they hitcha, yeah

Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game
All aboard the train, we're leavin' tonight
Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

The thing that I do would only take a king to peruse
Never flirtin' with the physical only my mind and mental
This world, an instrumental, my life became the pencil
The paper is the days that gone by
I write with inspiration, with love for every nation
Yes, the hypnotic, Portuguese, Neurotic
From a land where they understand a man is symbolic
The soul's really what controls where everybody started

And where everybody's going to and up
Got lost in the dark because you didn't care enough
About the light, a vision that persuades me to write
A vision that persuades me to keep it shining
Bright for the Lord
Never go no where without my sword
This train could leave at anytime y'all better all aboard
Whether livin' day to day, or livin' heart to heart beat
A true Souljah suffers agony but never sees defeat

Why we always get caught up playin' that same ol' game
Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game
All aboard the train, we're leavin' tonight
Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

A yo, we all roll the dice in the game of life
Father forgive me for my sins even when I did 'em twice
Even when I did 'em 3 times, the 4th and the 5th
Never through I'd be the one you'd blessed with the gift
And I'm overwhelmed by it, but I must admit
That every time I grab the mic I never hesitate to spit
And if you wanna test God then do it
I'm just gonna warn you son, I been through it
And to my fine ladies, how you doin'?
Open your eyes and your mind what you doin'?

Give it up at such a young age, why you ruin your life?
All you wanted to be was a wife and blew it
And now you stuck with, three children, baby bottles and
Strollers too, and never thought
Dirty diapers would smell the way they do
And high school was cool
Until you got played for the fool tryin' to study for class
With a screamin', baby, burpin' up all over you

Why we always get caught up playin' that same ol' game
Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game
All aboard the train, we're leavin' tonight
Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

And we can break down these sounds and take time to meditate
On the word of God so your wisdom can escalate
When you gonna put your foot down, take a note now
Acceptin' God is your only hope now

Reach down, deep down in your heart
You talk the talk but do you walk the walk'
You say you love God but do you really love God'
Will you still love God when situations get hard'
Or will you walk away, or will you get down and pray
And worship the Lord almighty like we'

Ain't it odd people take God so lightly, check it
Satan is waitin' to fight me and you might say
That I'm dumb for walkin' away, I chose the right way

Despite the obstacles that stand
In my way don't play praise God with two hands
Lift 'em up to the sky, head to the ground
Every knee will bow down, to Jesus don't play around

And if you say you found God then prove it
Profess it with yo tongue you gotta mouth, son use it
Jesus is the name above all names
Forget a famous superstar, God possess all fame

He posses all thing around me, around me
Word, His Holy words neva seize to astound me
And everywhere I look and everywhere I go",Worship,2002

Souls of Mischief,"Yo whassup, this is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement, my ace been
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit

I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'mma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

Yo,
it's like this and only this,
so I'm go'n tell
Me and my moms in front of the mall, and then I seen this nigga, Ramel
From fifth grade,
I knew this kid was swift
Paid was how his mind logged, so he got his grind on
But now it's years later,
I say ""Hey"" ta him
He flash his fronts fulla AU, and ""Hey you!""
The warning drove from a Seville as it sped by,
Lead fly, ratta-tat-tatta, his blood spatta
I strive ta, see the driva with my eye,
Moms grabbed sky, and caught lead in her thigh, I
Put her behind the trash can, dashed to my man,
It was to late, it's sad that Ramel was perferated
Waited and sweated, for the medics as my moms bled
Even if he was alive at the scene, by now my man Ram's dead
The cops do not care,
'cause our skin has too much shade in it'
They'll dismiss this as some niggas misbehavin'
But I'll never forget the driver of that blue Seville
And live for the day to bust shots in his grill,
But still, I can't do this alone,
My crew's line, so I slip two dimes into the pay phone. . .

OPIO:

I'll stay home, get some rest, call my girl an'
Tajai's on the phone, talkin' about the world's end
What happened?
Ya moms got capped an' ya nigga's dead?
Ya talkin' about paybacks, and bullets in the head?
Well 'um, hoodz come in dozens, but I got a cousin,
That live around the block, an' they got a glock,
an' we can swiftly bust 'em
I trust 'em,
wit my life, an' plus the glock is light, an'
Easily concealed, easy it'll peel a cap right
Hey Tajai, don't stop, rap too tight (?????)

(Opio: Yo Taj, man, you a'ight, man?)
(Tajai: Yeah, let's just get dem niggaz)

Maintain composure, hit the dosia,
Pick uh booga,
don't be shook up, I got hook up
Look up my ManiPhesto, I need the special,
Teams for the schemes, get A-Plus so he can brings
The blueprints,
to the residence,
the measurements and features
We're gonna cause explosions wit Clorox Bleach an'(Boom!)
Ping pong balls, hear through walls with a stethascope
Tap their phones, watch their every move with a telescope
Peep their favorite spots, inventing plots for their demise
On the DL, make sure, to the crimes, we have no ties

PHESTO:

Around about noon I got a buzz on my ringa (Ring)
What a humdinga, what happened to Tajai's mom?
Uh gonna was some kid named Ramel
My mission was to flip the aparrel, escaping by my coattails
An' from Thrifty,
swiftly lift the ping pong balls in hand
I ran where I was most suspected to be founded
Bounded up my pals and snuffed the ruffnecks who buck tips
Hollow and follow and trace every single face
Then deface them anyway we could

We was not wit the consequences being much worse

Ten o'clock, on the dot, meet around the block
From his crib, we can get this kid shot, plus I got
His sister on my tip, she says she's ready to try us
Let's get her, an' break off all her fingers wit some pliers(Nah, that's
ill)
Anyway, Tajai, jet around to the back, an'
Be strapped, since it was ya moms you should gat that
Criminal,
shoot him in his kneecaps first
Don't waste no time, you see that grill, remember we blast first
Opio and Phesto, let's go get the south window exits
In your nexxus(???) is the moment we should flex, it's
definitely on, I bust one to the front
We got the exits covered, there's no way that he can run
The stupid nigga ran to the back like I expected
Tajai said skip the knees, saw his grill, he shot and wrecked it
Death is what he got, yo he shot, an he started all the cappin'

Yo, nineteen ninety-three
New year, new world champions
Hahaha like this

Yo, the ill-minded mack will find the facts
I rhyme and acts, niggaz bound til I'm attacks
When niggaz say I can't rhyme I recline
I'm the first to tell you, I got G's in my verse who tell me
It hurts a fella when I rip, because I'm sly slick
The nigga fly chicks ride dick with me
I'm leaving niggaz stranded man that's how I planned it
Landed blows with my random flows
And it goes -- a little something like this
And I might diss, with my right fist I strike kids like a pitcher do
I split your bitch you better switch or I twist ya
I play tricks like a mix
When booty niggaz miss the beat
I figure that they wack I go and get my bat and a pack of Swisher sweets
Plus be ill when I bust the grill but we chill
Who the fattest?  {Hiero}  It's batting practice

[Tajai]

It's no feat, how I defeat, weaker
individuals set em up like give and go
A heat seaker, I take a bat and brighten your features
Beseech ya, proving I'll do that too
'cause when you, pulls my clothes on and shrouded
I'm out with ya grip and you're pimpin so how did he
do that shit, who dat kid, you're asking the masked man
Who fly higher than NASA
Ask friends what you need when I need your blockin
Then I leave you knocked in
Counts to call I scrubs em all
With the quickness, using fitness, leave you fitless
Who got a problem with me ripping all than I do
I'm batting way more than you
Hey sure you knew my rhymes was fly
My lines imply that I'm fatter, next batter

Chorus: repeat 2X

It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all

[Opio]

Get the fuck out, I never struck out
Better get the bucks out, and kick em down
Wrecking, extreme havoc when I'm practicing
That could mean a loss of consciousness when I launches this
Back to the scene of the crime I'm never on sight
Untouchable, what you pulled another hiest?
Precisely, I's be the man that did it
Said it, free up your possession never regretted
No anthistetic so you're headed for some suffering
Bufferin can't ease the aches and pains of my-grains
When I trail this drain on your lifestyle
Pull a knife while, you give it up, simp
I'm a pimp got your hoe and got your dough
and got the best flow in the universe, snatchin titles
like a purse, niggaz be the spot in a hearse
I'm worse, than the baddest bat crack

[Phesto]

It's Phesto so get your cash flow, I crushed em
It's gone, right before your eyes, if you're wise
Another hiest done nice when I slice
your neck and snatch a duffle-bag with a sag
and a tag in your crew, dag how you do
Dangerous if it's your brain I bust they taking
chains and stuff, from the victim eyes is surprised
And I'm quick to size men, up with a swing to your grill
What I planned difficult that's split your skull
with a tool, if you ever fool, with us all
Did you ever think, if you blinked
I wouldn't get you for your links, and your cash and your minks
Savage enough to keep my average up
Puttin chumps in assume a new marking then I'm scots-free
Watch me, duck into the night with your valuables
I'm getting down with my tools

Chorus

Hah, whassup?  Tell me we ain't the best now

Souls of Mischief,"[Tajai]

It gets no fatter
Add another crew to your favo-ritos
Yes we knows our shit is flavor
In battle, I rip it, and niggaz hectic after
I flipped the script like a dyslexic actor
You're no factor
I got the type of skills that make you want to quit
I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I harm the shit, but see next this keen text
be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm
I'm flyer, damn, would you grok it can't you receive it
I bust like cleavage, rock shit, then I leave it
in shambles, 'cause I can like Campbell's
A sample of Tajai, is much more than average

[Opio]

Yo, who the hell are you?  You're not me
I got me and three brothers that are cocky
to rock the, masses, whippin niggaz asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, cause it makes me think of more shit to kick
Leave me alone, back the hell up hobbes
I never thought my son would ever try to beat up pops
I got a leather strap, for the fella that
want to tell the mack lies, I send em back with black eyes

Chorus: repeat 2X

DisseshowIdo, disseshowIdo

[Phesto]

I ain't trippin, what I'm flipping's on the contrary
to your weakness, retreat if you want to restrain
from being beat, I freak lifting syllables
so kill the bullcrap, I'm arousing dousing drowning
When my sound swings, I found things
to bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
'cause I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill, the noise, my boys, never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

[A-Plus]

My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
satanic messages I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles, I wipe smiles
and smirks off of jerks 'cause that weak shit don't never work
Niggaz is WACK as fuck your over
Get your life together, find some direction cluck nigga
I got the titanium steel verse, slicin through
With some shit that you'll never ever do

Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips

I sew the girls up like schweppes, so many kids might fret

Afterwards I'm bouncing dips like tits on chicks
Who be running track, then they be running back for more
Rest assured, it's absurd for her to be your linga
I get the finger, 'cause she can't get the stinga
Any longer, my dong can stretch and I'm stronger
I got the daddy ding-a-ling to get you hot and bothered
Get the kinks out when my stink in the pink shout and scream
Butta second fling is but a dream

From day one I played hoes in the schoolyard, my tool heartless
But not for dips submerging it ain't hurt men to merge in
My status, from baddest to tims I'm pulling more hips
Than gravity, and after the skins get hit, I'm drowsing
Arousing the next dousing the next thousand my saliva
The liver ones 'cause I don't try to run in no dumb females
Some be swell, but, my picks so why tricks
Get restricted to flicks with boo boo heads, I screw you dead

[Chorus]
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man
I call myself the man

Niggaz cling, and get attached to things on the flute
That's insane, I just be in and bang, get boots
For gosh sakes, that broad shakes, her thang to the whole game
The way the labia lips hang it's a sad shame
Clapping when you're tapping, just hit the scraps and be at em
The breasts sag like they're saddened
The skins are wrinkled, dry, worn and battered
Leave em shattered, she's as fly as a maggot

The him I am, the man I'm him
Bustin skins out, I been stout erect checkin dips
When I'm wreckin lips and clitorises, hit her with this
swinging from my you-know-what's so you know butt cheeks
Are clapping tapping the guts on the late with your date
Makes my ego [ha-hah] read those lipstick marks on my penal tip
They don't lie, penis took your dip to a fly despise
My description, why, when I'm making them lips bend

I hit it, I did it, I admit it
I never quit it, yes I knock the boots like I was riddick
Bowe, get with it, hoe, I get with
No, boomerang broads with nasty toes
Keep your corns on your husk you muskrat
But if she's fly, I try to bust that
Glutinous maxims, I wax and bust
I'm taxin just to be the mack man plus

Once I been with women, friendship done been the sole outcome
How come skins can't work their way in? 
The question resting late night at her pad and
Scheming to grab and season, 'cause she's in
I fiend getting mad horny, transforming charges
Into swinging me, seemingly hard miss
Let her know that I was on it
Now I got dibs on that crib I'm +welcome back+ 'cause I caught her

Nas-T, Massey, be the last G
From medical texts to class me
Ask me, if I had to grip my pad
the riffs I grab would rip and stab
the kids that sag the shit they strap
is flavorless, and wreckless
Your bestest behavior gets

a razor gets parlayed amidst
and later splits a feeling that
I made ya hit, a really phat I gave to kids
when I punched em
I crunch men, at a function

Ponder on this, I swallowed the spliff with elocution
Encompassing the pompous means when I escalate my tool
shins get split, men get spindled swiveled pivoted
by my riveting centrifuge
I swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knife splits
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin the brittle
and flimsy with my whimsy
Puns and phrases I stun and phase kids
Terrorize em paralyze em paraplegic, when I leave em
Mindless spineless vertabraetless with menengitis
I earn em swift and minus a life with my nine

I know my what nots, stoppin flows like blood claats
Nah, 'cause that's a bad word in Jamaican
And I am that, grams packed 'cause my jam's phat
So get the beaner butter we discovered treasure
You're sweet when I stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
'cause I write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
The best from the West 'cause I'm fresh and you're rotten
Take out the trash or I'll take it out your ass
With a blast from the past in the future, I'll shoot ya
But for the present beatdowns will suffice
Lose 'cause you choose to be down with some mice
You dumb dunces I come once it's my time to
want to hear a joke?  I'm you
Don't you wish I won't dismiss your treachery
I bet you be, leaving upon a stretcher G

[Opio]

I'm coming tighter, your rhymes are Oreida
Little reminiscent of the poetry I write
a-stoundingly, you're sounding like me, might we
Step outside and settle this I cause catastrophes
I laugh at these cause my shit is astonishing
Demolishing, you and your following I'm swallowing
MC's like I was a black hole ramsack those
wack flows who chose to oppose
I don't suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
Reverses the process, god bless you swing and whoa it's you!

I rip through bodies with corkscrews you wish you never tried

And my pockets relax
Calm. 
Collecting my scratch .
And the girlies attracked.
I snatched
Women, make them collapse on their back side.

When I'm finished, vanish into the night.
Like the caped crusader don't say ""hi"" to the trick.
Can't appreciate them, 'cause they just be riding the dick.

See, we too fly to be weak.
Telling hoes to step aside.
Be like ""I ain't the one,""

Always cautious with my cash, 'cause my dad told me so.

Invade the stage,
And retreat for the shade.

And see if emcees elaborate

A rash display,
Under the gun,

In an abominal effect.

Whether you tread or rest your head until ya
Succumb to the voice that's deep within, you should know

Chorus:

It's time to let the weak shit go, no more
And if you with us, hoe hoe!!!
You should know, it's time to let that wack shit go, no more
And if you with us, hoe hoe!!!

Verse Three: Opio

They say I'm too posessive, aggressive
I make a mess of MC's depress em, plessin em
The West eclipse the rest, suggestions, to the ones in my profession
Testin, congestin, the mic doin impressions
Souls of Mischief make em all fall in succession
If you're pressin luck self destruct
I'm vindictive, so descriptive
Intriguing on the mic, we don't see things alike
I strike at breakneck speeds and leave you think twice
'fore I sink ice cold lyrics and you're sliced
through the mirror and it's right to the center
where it hurts, convert
Reconsider the bitter, consequences
You're defenseless against us, you go berzerk
Ingesting MC's like clockwork, when I rock
murderous rhymes one time for your mind
And drop dimes for them niggaz who don't get live

Verse Four: A-Plus

I reduce you to dust piles
Plus styles'll crush smiles, seducing women til they bust out
of they garments, always give the crowd what they wanted
I rock the mic and now, they don't want you on it
So I own it, I make my grip tight
It's like I'm nuttin nice when I'm writing rhymes to cut and slice men
You wouldn't, I win every time that we clash
I will surpass ya, A-Plus a known flasher
Rhyme if you want to, it makes no difference
cause you still gonna die, youse a goner
You shouldn't even try, why was you on the
mic in the first place
You even chose tbe track, see yousa nigga with the worst taste
I make you niggaz disperse with haste
My tape first with bass hurts your face we curse the fates
I think that I should be your human idol
Makin MC's suicidal when they lose they title

Chorus: repeat 2X

Now, you should know, it's time to let that wack shit go
No mo', and if you with us, hoe hoe!!
Now you should know, you need to let that wack shit go
No mo', and if you with us, hoe hoe!!

First of all, for you pussies
don't take it personal

prepare to spit
so don't experiment
you won't know where I went
shiftin all directions
and attempt to escape
but wait the connections sensin
aware of what terrors lurk
so I'd be alert
assess the damage, after I kick a verse
it hurts... stoppin rappers dead in their tracks on wax
I cannot be broken down on fractions
the fantastic four... attach
words together like a latch
or a clasp when we pass the mic

I avoid it.
Like being exploited.
Couldn't leave my people disappointed.

It'll be here and gone just that fast.
You better bust that ass.
Nothing's inconcievable.
Anything is possible.
Never let them deceive you.

I contend to that.

Will it be...
A good job?
Huh?
Two to the head?
Huh?
Maybe HIV so i can join the ranks of the living dead.
But, hey Tajai gotta press on.
I'm late for class
As I think of the choices my life rests on.
I could buss my gat,
Cook some crack,
Master calculus,
Build houses,
And make a stack.
Either wayI
Depending on the dues i pay.
No, you can't go,

Opio:

If you're with me then you're all about making money.
So throw your hands in the air 'cause ain't shit for free.
Nigga, Oakland California is the place to be.
It gets hectic see.
I just connect to free
My mind
And write rhymes,
So I don't get caught up
Or get shot up.
Plus the fuzz think I got the product??
I don't cut lines, I don't have to.
But if you look like a playa, they harass you.
I make cash from doing shows from state to state.
But still task on the run that license his plate.
I don't trip 'cause it's all in vain.
Your daughter knows my name.
Ask the broad the game.

Never lame.
Just rhyming to your brain, buss.
You're acting and that's a shame.
'cause I set examples say in 9-tre.
It's not a little joke.
I gots to rhyme a little more,
So I'm fin ta go
And scoop a forty-o.
I'm under 21, but then my sack is known as so.
To the show we go
Place a big stoge on the bridge, 8-0.
A club with foes and hoes.
I want high class bitches
With the ass that switches.
When I get them, they be due soon as the Ad. is finished.
Make me me feel like I'm living on the wrong planet.
Strong as granite.

Attract the knowledge changed.

Succulent breasts
Bustin' through that dress
Impress me and shes
Hold up turn around so we can see the rest

What a dame
A mothaphukkin' shame
What's ya name
You look fantastic
She responded enthusiastic
Was it the fame
They all the same
What's the difference in this plastic
No drastic measures
Just for pleasure, laughs, kicks
Conversation was simple
She liked my dimples
Asked me when will I be leaving town
It's goin' down
I said tomorrow
A look of sorrow crossed her face
But I'm an ace
Shot out to the hotel for the satin lace treatment
Victoria's secrets
Get me weak in the knees
Baby please don't tease me
She put the squeeze on me
Had me whipped
A tight grip
The perfect fit I flipped
I couldn't handle it
Shot 'em out but now I want 'em back
Baby doll tell me where the phuk you at. . .

Yeah, now this shit here sounds like some interlusion
So let me kick some lewdness
Slackness
I wish I had a bitch that practiced
Gymnastics
And when I hit it from the back this girl
Would twirl and twist and fat lips
And make the johnson vibrate like a tonsil
Plus on the tonsils
Honeyboo be on the job
And if I try to hang she be like a bat outta' hades
Phuk around get with the nigga my lady
I want a bitch that's
Maybe glaze me in some cherries and heavy syrup
But neva no reigns see and neva no stirrups
None of that s and m
Just undressin' when
It's appropriate and even when it's not
Cause she hot, so ...

[Chorus]

I knew this nigga that was bigga than life
Pullin' the trigga and knives
He'd stick up in ya in fights, and he was
The kind of nigga causin' pain and static
When you seen him he would make you wanna aim your 'matic
But that is not happenin'
That nigga got back
Cause if you shot at him
80 niggas would be on your block cappin'
He had family
Understand me
And he know popo know he make his dough sellin' candy
He got friends in high places
White men in skyscrapers
I bet they help him beat his 5 cases
Untouched a true mack indeed
He'd pull a mac and bleed
He made a stack from crack and weed
He phuckked up the fact is
The nigga tried to duck taxes
Now he at that ah nigga you, punk status
Federal pen with non-hetero men
Climbin' ya front to back
Aw nigga where the phuk ya at

I like them ripe hips
To slide in
After the shows we rock these
I'm captivatin' hoes to wax and they attract me
I see that lookin' in my eyes with fascination
Mesmerized
So I'm buckin' them thighs
For a visit later she replied
Yes
To see her undressed
I just couldn't deny 'cause she possessed
The most voluptuous
Ass and d cups
It was almost too much for just me
I said what's up with us
We got in the cut and let the lust erupt
Scandalous as she did me justice
With them luscious lips
Givin' a nigga rushes
With the slightest touches but bust this
Now I gotta live with the repercussions
Corruption
She raised up when I dazed under the assumption
She could be trusted
Now I'm like what's this
Flustered
Left for broke all 'cause this
Hoe I'll probably never see again
Had a motive and
Got me for my dough
So all I really wanna know
Is bitch ...

Souls Of Mischief rock tha house.
So baby spread your wings now,

show you right from wrong you want to do it again.
Release all that pinned up aggression
come caress and massage my dick, baby

Damn right Hieroglyphics for life.
Close knit while these others crews fight we write hits,
as for us settlin'
discrepancies with other mc's, it's a breeze.
Cause I stay focused while they frustrated.
Ease off the mic,
don't cause a ruckus
it's destructive,
unproductive,
see us we keep in touch with the one's that bite,

but it's a miss match I guess
I attract the wack backstage.
We wage battles and leave em unscathed.

for the female folk who want to get into some mischief,
submissive like I got em drunk,
and I got em junked,
with they knees hyperextended, weakened,
speaking in tongues like a ventriloquist,

while these niggaz oversaturated with exaggerated nonsense,
I don't respond simp.
They just punks beyond dips.
Infatuated with they lyrics never corespondent.

that they don't belong on the mic like
germs, I like to watch them squirm,
convincin' me they styles
anything more then elementary, but spermacidal
is the title they've earned.

I'm comin' from the land of dope,
where all of these niggaz never planned to hope.
You can either be the man to know,
but my plan was writin' hella raw.
Standing quiet cause I be the man ya like,
to hand the mic,
so I can make a dollar, and make ya holler.
I never fake a scholar
dumpin' rappers in a lake of water.
I proceed to max,
be pagin' Leed if I need the sacs,
get the weed relax.
In the O we knowin' where you at,
be in the cut if you scared of them gats,
cause Oakland niggaz be prepared to jack shit.

Runnin' up in your residences
Runnin' busters for their presidentials
In my sights I won't miss you
Once you gone I won't miss you
Livest nigga be a dead issue
Your flesh is just tissue for my talented talents to rip through
Physical enslaved to my imbalanced mental
My confidence is not confidential

Yeah I suffocate featherweight MC's never resucitate
Decimated easily as my voice fluctuated sentence structure
This critical juncture for you youngstas

Blood rushin' display of luxury and immerse ya
Submerge ya beyond the verge of word perfection

Yo these niggas out a pocket I cold
Cock'em and cock at their nose
Stopping their comment just for haulin' that garbage

Be about it or get rowdy

I spit that
Liquid detergent
Game like George Gervin
Ice water
Under pressure operate like Julius Erving
The surgeon, hovercraft percusion
With spontaneous combustion
highly flammable magma through the mouth

[Chorus: Tajai]x2
I am
Touched, unsane, deranged and such
But my mind still clicks in the clutch
You run up you get, touched
Molested marauded messed with
I'm charged with electric current
And burn 'em so don't, touch
Gimme room to bloom or boom impending doom
Thoughts consume man I got that
Touch, a feel for the real panache, pizzaz
Skill and lots of that
So I just build now

I'm so hard headed, I never listen
That's why I cut class everyday it felt like prison
Poppin' at your ex-girlfriend in detention
Tossed her in the library got my duck sick then
The next day I was jalapeno dick pissin'
Raw (that need?) the vixen on a suicide mission
Bad bussiness the pussy had me mystified
Couldn't trust her but I risked my life
Bad business my dog as my witness
Tried to act church girl religious
She had a hit list
Bad business lucky what if syphillis
Or the monster
What you got that all for a boo?

That's bad business
Spendin' all your time wastin' your time
That's bad bidness that's bad bidness
Yeah what do we have behind curtain
Number three, ghetto fantasy
Young buck sixteen, in a state of emergency
Got you thrown in juvenile hall
Cause you toss a marked car it's stupid
Fit out a Lakeshore
But you want to bounce over the hill to thirteen?
That's bad bidness
Ten dollar genocide is senseless
You want to be a pharmacist?
All you doin' is harming us
What about Paris Robinson
Medgar Evers and Huey

Of misdeeds hopin' you don't get caught

When promises are made that you have to break
Spoken in vain for accolades

When you accept a wrong
Instead of correct a wrong
That shit ain't to be slept upon
That's bad business
When ain't no one in the world
You can call a friend

I took a five hour plane flight
Spittin' at my homegirl via satellite

Idea was top the secret
And you wouldn't belive it unless you peeped it
She was off the chain, all-terrain
All insane alcohol stalled her brain
Last night I caught the right weed
Had my body slow-mo but thoughts at light speed (last night!)
Was a long one I was on one, a strong one
Smoke it 'til it's all done

We out we out we out
Forty miles over the speed limit
On target like a bullet to the knees
From the SWAT team when I'm
Shootin' these in 'em
Trigger kamikaze but two shots are hidden then
Step into the station (Pass A-Plea the venom)
So we can take a sip and let the poison get in 'em
Ink off the mic like a vortex without a bitch or a Lex
I get more affection
Payin' no attention cause I learned my lesson
Cold hearted bitterness so I never sweat them (last night!)
Starstruck the Hollywood hoes in action
Master your high watch out they backstabbin'

Burning rubber in a riddle livin' in the fast life

I saw the last of my ID's
One too many a dem Long Island ice teas

Feelin' light hearted off the lime and Bacardi (last night!)

Too conditioned for your highness but we did it all night

Last night I spend my whole night out
Met some hoes outta fest for low riders
Mind hunters, lip gloss shine & hypnotizin' minor men
And like a fool I invite 'em into my ride
When we was already high but with tequila sunrises
Jack & mai tais
It was all over
Wished I stayed sober cause I don't know what
Happened and niggas keep on laughing (last night!)

I smoked a bomb sack facial
Then I got a call from this girl I hate bro (what?)

Kickin' up dust and disappear in a sand storm

Spine to your liver
Flash like a line sniffer I'm swifter
Than Michael Jordan snortin' some speed
And I'll give ya
Much more than you need yo fly nigga
Scorin' the weed sticky green'll make me high quicker
Twistin' it and mixin' it with Bacardi lime liquor
Beligerent kickin' it with (tati on?) the time ticker
You could be a dyin' man with a mic but I'm sicker
You rhyme wack as I bust like Leon Isaac
Makin' peons slide back
That don't be on the right track, we way off
So now they stay soft like impotence
But I say naw, I'd rather stay raw
Magnificent rippin' it
Givin' it all I can though

Wreckin' the beats
Gettin embassy's executive cheese

I'm the loose cannon aid on deck
Detonate in a millisec
Covered in a blackened silloutte
And still reflects enough light
To shatter your body like a pinyata
Bobofet or
Jim Cata doin' lyrical kapoeta
The net to netta
Smokin' purple fibers off the hedges
Till it's resin
And pledge allegiance
To the essence
Confront Phes rock
Ever present with hesitance
My tongue twistin' tornadoes
Never miss your residence

Me and the mike is holy matrimony
Tackling your phony flow matrix
You couldn't absorb or deflect the impact
With roll cages
The soul aces
Take you to that oasis

Move upon you with logic

Ain't no way you fittin' to dislodge that

Bend your mind like a fender
How the (bought?) of my new agenda
My deluge of lewd yet shrewd mental food will wet you
And your crew
So eschew from testin' my standard issue
Let alone the cannons and missles for heavy damage aimed at those
Grandstanding with petty anti-antics
Can't match those, handcrafted by my many mechanics
Who's skills run the gamut who will run the planet
Any time I exert my will it's outstandin'
To the point where you gotta hand it or hate and be mad
It don't matter to me
Over a bed of fresh beats its style au natural with no additives

Even if you brandishing guns and break laws
I make you let the pistol go and praise God
A dynamo
Shinin' on the mike like a quasar
They can't infiltrate the steel cage brain star
I'm feelin' blood hounds all on my trail
Like my lyrics was peruvian candy
Not a fugitive
Truly expanding minds with rhymes with the family
Who be gettin' higher than the Andes
The way I plant seeds deep in the underground
Make the thunderous pound to get your heart pumpin'
Spark up the kryptonite
People gettin' lit tonite
Indica-like, to try to simplify try

We surpass the summit

Before they can ask for sentiments and flow tear gas your tenements
After I flash the emblem
A symbol of the last millennium
Who the best boy?
Yeah we askin' anyone
Peg your chest and
Crush your velvet, shatter your pelvic
Hard hat or your helmet spin in the cockpit of a plane
And the tail spins
Still my satin smooth
Patented moves raps scat and
Scoop fatten the groove flatten your crew
Could happened to you
Word it's my propensity to cut back
Instantly change direction at my point of attack and leave tracks

When I ex-sling I silk screen these words in your chest

Fuck profiting off these profligate tales

In synchronous increments
Seemingly seamlessly
I'm a semanticist
Prayin' like many a mantis is
Though I'm not meanderin' answerless
Meditation that's my medication
Concentration leads to consternation
And conceptual inception
Interspersed interjections
Incite insurmountable insurrections
In the urban sections
Stretchin' my sharpest weapon
Precise etchin's of life's lessons, scaled and detailed to perfection

See, I was told all in love is unfair
One fee, one fare, done there
Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air

See my advice to the homie Stoney
Is do it your own way, the long way

Sweet mother mine
Grayest sky
Gun metal eyes

Beneath the needle tree
The ghost of you and me
They sing the saddest song
Just one last breath and gone

Some say this highway seven
Is a long and lonesome road
Don't ask me little Rosa
What direction I am going

I used to love
And take the southern special
When the summer rise and fall
Now I ride the national

If I had a black cat bone
Then I would not be alone
Do it darling, dig my grave
This cemetery is my own

Grayest sky
Gun metal eyes

Under the needle tree
The ghost of you and me
They, they sing the saddest song
Just one last breath and gone

I used to love
And take the southern special
When the summer rise and fall
Now I take the national

Some say this highway seven
Is a long and lonesome road
Don't ask me little Rosa
What direction, I don't know

If I had a black cat bone
Then I would not be alone
If I had a black cat bone
I would not be alone

Soulsavers,"Are those halos in your hair or diamonds shining there?
Without a hope, without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
Turn your eyes to better men

Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there

Girl, lay your shame to rest
And hold the lies close to your breast
You stoop to feed the crows
Some scraps of truth already cold

Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there
And every kingdom of rain comes pouring down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long

Would you put halos in your hair?
Without a hope, without a prayer
With lies close to your breast
You finally lay your shame to rest

Held on to what I'd been dreaming.
Woke up this morning, I had one desire,
To get back to what I'd been seeing.
Heaven,
It was heaven.
I have never known a bliss, 
Witnessed anything like this.
Glowing all over as I started on my feet
Tootootooooooooo

Now I know I've seen the light,
Make it go on shining

Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart,
I want you oohooohoooh

All the sweet kisses, all the tenderness,
That are being shared all around me,
Only remind me of my own distress,
No loving arms to surround me.
Falling,
I am falling,
You could help me out again, 
Being mine forever...

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart...
I want you oohoohooooh

You got it, you got it,
There'll be no doubt about it,
Nobody's gonna keep from you
Ooh
I want you, I need you,
Gonna find a way to get through,
Nobody's gonna keep from you

Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do?

People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two

The east side kept me off the curb and
Betsy Ross was sufferin from the scaredy cat

Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on

I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel

Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
""But you got a girlfriend""

[Slick Rick]
Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'away from the navy'

So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicy
And now you supposed to be

But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling

Don't leave no road maps
We don't need no plans

Tiffany diamonds
Walks by the sea
Flowers and chocolates
Did nothing for me

Something has happened
I once was cool
So liberated
But now I'm a fool

There's no shame
In that old love cliché
Like those sayings
That my mama used to say

There's no shame
In that old love cliché
Do di-ah, di-ah, di-ah, di-ah

We sending this one out right here
To all the young thug and young hustlers out there
You know I'm sayin', grown up with their moms strugglin'
In the hood yo' I'm sayin', ya know how it is
Trying to keep it tight, you know I'm sayin' 
Geah

Born and raised a black youth, no happy days
My moms and pops went they separate ways
Now she solo with half the dough, and three kids
No house, a damn tight situation we in

Hit the streets to look for work and pay
So her kids can have it better than she had one day
Try to teach me some rules, ""Get A's in school
Keep your head up high and don't run with the fools""

That was the lesson, always listen to moms
Bible she totin, always quotin from Psalms
Young but I'm knowin' the right thang to do 
Know the things to say when times is blue

Times is hard and really unfortunate
I'm young and I really don't like the shit
But I dream nice things when I sleep at night
When I grow up I'll make everything alright
Sing

[SOULTRE]
I know it's hard sometimes
But if you can make a way, you need to hold up
I know a better way
And if you can wait today it'll be alright...

[EIHT]
Now I'm 15, my life done hit a split screen
What used to be a good kid struck a bad gene
Bad dreams, young thugs and crime scenes
Skip school, saggin' my jeans and blow green

My moms don't know where I get the shit from
If you keep trippin' you know the outcome
Laid up somewhere, or in jail
Makin' collect calls tryin' to make bail

Hell, and you know how I struggle for the cheddar
Before I give it away better get it together
My guilty conscience sayin' not no listen
The other have tellin' me, keep a good intention

Aw shit, a nigga need a mind of his own
Too much to deal with, I really don't feel shit
Young thug ready to take on the world
Who made my life take such a twirl
Come on

[Chorus]
Now my situation's changed, no chains remain
Now I try to check out the game and cause pain
Long live the days of homeboys and straps
Gang of tombstones for the ones that caught caps

Make snaps off raps, reminiscin' of days
Good part is shot up while 'More Bounce' plays
Missin the days sometimes, but keeps my eyes on the future
Keep my hands on my heat cause niggas might shoot ya

Rob a nigga blind, just like Stevie
I used to do the same when a nigga was greedy
But my come-up was wrong, flipped it, now it's strong
Now I clocks snaps, keep the street shit in my songs

Trying to make it up on a stage from doin' a bid
Trying to make a better way like she did for my kids
Right now watch out, keep my nose to the grind
Yeah boy, this world is mine
Geah

Sophisticated - love the way, it hurts
Let your mind fall down!

I'm not dancing I'm just shifting weight

And make the others drool

To keep a silver spoon bright - fly up to balloon height... 
To ride the spotlight in the sky 
But did you ever stop to wonder why?

Just like it was going out of style
It don't bother her to take it or how hard I work to make it
I just can't say no when she smiles
She's wicked and she's lusty, someday she's gonna bust me
And the day my money's gone she will be too
But it don't even phase me, my friends all think I'm crazy
Lovin' her is all I want to do

She's got a sexy, sexy way that drives me wild
She's the center in her heart and it's tearin' me apart
Lord, don't I love that evil child

Sometimes I get the feeling that I'll have to take up stealing
Just to give her all that she desires
And although I might regret it but I'd go right out and get it
Because she sets my soul on fire
I'm afraid someday I'll lose her but I still can't refuse her
I keep givin' everything I can
I know all the doubt about her but I still can't live without her
Ain't it strange what love will do to a man

If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?

If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Amar de esta forma total es amar de por vida
Ni el agua de los siete mares apaga este fuego
No puedo evitar entregarme a este ardiente deseo

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas

Cierro los ojos pensando si no te tuviera
No habría ni luna ni noches si yo te perdiera
Si acaso naciera otra vez y tuviera esa suerte
Yo solo estaría por ti, por volver a quererte

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti

Hit record spots from town to town
Dug deep in the crates where plates are found
Schooled by the greats that shaped the round
Phonograph, yo I break roots in half
Straight architect gets down for the craft
With the sound that hits the spot
Makin' heads bob while your speakers get hot (echoes)
I'm gonna add vocab into the mix
Articulate my words so the concept sticks
G-E-T-D-O-W-N
Then ascend with the three Sound men
Straight to the peak, where poets speak
Jams are live and people vibe
To the underground sound that's history bound
Once again, we're gonna get on down

This is remeniscin' of the days gone by
When the brothers were fresh, and the ladies were fly
Dancefloors were packed, and cold bottles were cracked
Dj's dropped the needle for the crowd to react
To a funky type of tempo that the wax rotate
Fresh rhymes are served up on a 12 inch plate
For the nation to see, the live science to be
Definition of soul on the M-I-see
Interlect is displayed, when the vocals are laid
Timin' is a factor when dissisions are made
So step inside the party all egoes aside
And let the crowd rock steady to the sound we provide
The three man band, Jay Skills and the Pro
Last but not least is my man Soulo
Creatin' the sound, that makes you gather around
Once again, we gonna get on down

Sound Sensation,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Ask me again if I can do you a favor
As the snow and the window get some business done
Your neighbor, who wishes you would stop getting locked out
It's all grist for your decay mill

So let the backlash begin
You would always say gray lightning was your only friend
The bleachers are empty the sky is an impossible blue

Soundalikes,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, never quite as good,

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA

Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies

And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam

I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.

Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

How can you buy or sell the sky
Or the warmth of the land it's strange to us
We don't own the freshness of the air
Or the sparkle of the water
How can you buy them from us
The white man doesn't understand our ways
For he's a stranger who comes in the night
And takes from the land just what he needs

Oh yeah

He treats his brothers like his enemies
When it's completed he moves on
He leaves his father's grave and his birthright
His birthright is forgotten
The air is precious to the red man
For all things share the same breath
The white man won't notice the air he breathes
Like a man dying for many days

All right now

The whites must treat the beasts of his land
As his brothers not his enemies
Tell me what is man without the beasts
I'll bet he will die of loneliness

One thing we know that the white man will
We know our god is the same god
You may think you wish to own him
Own him as you wish to own our land
But he is the body of man
And the earth is precious to him

And you will suffocate in your waste",Into the Void (Sealth),1992

With a pony on the tether pulling cold and sugarcane.

There go your knees. 
And there she goes.
She's a-hauling cane like it was gold.

And when she calls upon the dead,
To stand up in her place, 
They'll raise the roof up overhead,
And speak out from her face.
And fish jump in her boat all day, 
And flog your feet like steel.

There go the dead.
Out through the roof.
She speaks your name,
Like it was proof.

And they wait for you in town,
They pull back on the lever,
And they bring the truck around.

Are like a penny for a fuse.

Sweet and undefeated and an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Won't, won't you tell her that I love her 

I woke up this morning, realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun 
I lost my head and I said some things
Now come the heartaches that the morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see 
I let my world slip away from me 

So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world? 
And if you did, was she crying, crying? 
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me 
Tell her I'm sorry

South African Vocal Choir,"Hey Mr. Gold Man! Where's my pay?
Hmm. Mr. Gold Man! Not one more day.
Mister! Can't you hear my children cryin'?

Came to Pretoria in 46, find myself a job
Met a man with a broken arm, he said:
Come along with us, get onto the bus

Hey Mr. Gold Man! I'm for sale!
Hey Mr. Gold Man! Please don't turn away.
Hey Mr. Gold Man! Can't you hear my tummy rumbling?

""Hey! You a gold digger? There's a job for gold diggers here
You won't get much - but it's a way to survive.""

So we continued down the road, till we got to the mine
Dirt and dust all around us now - Hey! I didn't mind
Cause I'm on the workline

Hey Mr. Gold Man! Where's my pay?
Oh Mr. Gold Man! Can't wait another day.
Oh Mr. Gold Man! Can't you see I'm almost dying?

""I'm a gold digger man,
22 pence a shift - no overtime.""

Then I heard a good friend say: There's a happening in Town
Come and join the Union, boy. 'Cause today, we ain't going down,
We're gonna stand our ground.

Hey Mr. Gold Man! Where's my pay?
O Mr. Gold Man! Won't wait another day.
O Mr. Gold Man! Can't you hear the thunder coming?

Hey Mr. Gold Man! Loose these chains.
Time Mr. Gold Man! Change is on its way.

South Central Cartel,"[ Havoc ]
Yo, this Havoc the Mouthpiece from the S.C.C.
I only got three words to say:
South - Central - Madness

[ Prode'je ]
Hoo-ridin in the Central, yeah, the gangsters mob for life
The Cartel's gonna roll the dice
One time for the mind of the niggas strollin deep
Watch your back, I'm about to creep
It's not Compton, it's South Central like a bitch
Another gee with a gaffled gangster pitch
If your game is weak, you speak straight punk
If funk jump you're soft and try to punk
Cause I'ma hit you in the face with it
I got a posse of crews to serve blues if you fuck with it
Yo, the Prode'je spoke and choke and choke
Who croak when the guns smoke, ?broke, you're half-loc'ed?
But I'ma break it down for those who know
Be real when you claim South Central
Cause on the Central tip you get pistol-whipped
And if the pistol slip, you get Uzi-clipped
211's in progress
Here comes the 187 if a sucker tries to fess
Kaos, Gripp, the ringleader is rip shit
And when I'm grippin the mic or when I flip shit

[ Havikk ]
It's not Compton, what's up punk, it's South Central
A crime wave of gangster-made criminals
Liftin a skit to your dome, I'm relentless, shit
Cock the nine and laugh when I blast this shit
Cause your ass got tossed
By the mafia king, you were hung by the boss
Havikk, my felonous pitch will lynch a bitch
Smoke and choke any punk on a off-stroke
Cause I provide the funk and it's homicide
Suckers collide with my drum and get hung
Gaffle, swarm and alarm and drop a storm of death
Eat your brain and watch your ass melt
In the Central I roam, I'm close to home
The dangerzone, muthafucka, get your head flown
By a loc, I'ma smoke, I'm no joke
Drop the floor on a noose and watch your ass choke
Feel the lyrics that blow, how it detonate
Hide your dome, the Cartel will penetrate
Your damn cranium, punk, who's the baddest?
You can't escape the South Central Madness

[ Havoc ]
Yo, this is the hype of all hypes
Hype-up track for '92
For South Central
Cold droppin gangsta

[ uncredited guest rapper number one ]
Yo, I got a gat, I'm tryin to deal with the Madness
Mexican gangsta, born with a badness
So I drink forties like a wino
And let me get it straight, don't give a fuck about a five-o
Cause I live on the edge like every nigga
A nine for a nine, get fly with a trigger
And man, I gat, so I guess I'm a rider
Bitches know I'm paid, so I guess that's why they strive for
I sling like the Cartel bang
Scorpio is ???? but you ain't gonna hang
My AK is fully automatic
If you want to live, chump, then don't get dramatic
Cause the jail's got a goddamn mafia
want to scrap, punk? Ace'll be droppin ya
When we're done you're gonna be feelin blue
Sleepin on the floor like a muthafuckin ????
Just because you thought you that crazy
Try to rush hard but your shit couldn't phase me
Cause I'm more than a brother that's mental
I'm the one Mexican that roam South Central

[ uncredited guest rapper number two ]
A city with so much credential
Livin in Central is strictly all mental
Coincidental, let me tell you what I'm into
Gamin on the niggas who think they can step to
A pretty seditty lady from the city
Looks are deceiving but my attitude is shitty
And don't try to step to me quick
Cause a 9mm in your mouth I will stick
And make you lookin like a popsicle
Hear the blast, and I see your blood trickle
Yeah, exactly what I figured
A bitch-made nigga that's scared to pull the trigger
On a lady that's got you feelin smaller
Shorter than short, I'm the lady shot caller
The boss that 24 is dissin
Any muthafucka who think they can fade this
S.C.C. is comin out slayin
It's not a gang when no Uzi is sprayin
A lady that's pullin all the cards
I smoke ya and leave ya dead with your dick on hard

[ uncredited guest rapper number three ]
Malibu beaches and everyday sunshine
Bullshit - my city's full of one-time
Rollin on a hunt for they favorite toy
Any gangsta nigga wearin khakis and Curduroys
House shoes or a pair of Nikeys
And you talkin 'bout you want to come and sight-see?
Fool, you better stay where you're at and keep your health
Cause where I'm from every nigga's for hisself
Or his set with the vest and a Tec
So if you've never been here, then channel 7 is your best bet
Me, I was raised in Watts after the riots
So I was taught: see the head, fly it
And one-time, I know they name and they faces
Because I see em on a everyday basis
Niggas claim hard cause of a warrant or a bounty
Others try to claim L.A. from Orange County
But ain't even close to claim hard knocks
That's why they dyin of a overdose of buckshots
I can't take it, my mic, somebody grab this
And keep flowin to the South Central Madness

[ Havoc ]
For all you muthafuckas out there don't know how we livin in South Central
Fuck y'all!

(Shit, goddamn
Get off yo ass and jam!)	(2x)

[ uncredited guest rapper number four ]
Westside, hoo-ride, let me kick a pimpin slide
Weak niggas straight trip when I ride
Young Westworld trippin on another flow
And yeah nigga, I still got my .44
In the front seat tryin to fuck with me?
And get sprayed, fool, this the S.C.
In the house, puttin niggas' heads out
Workin em out, trippin em out without a doubt
And still stuffin big dick in your hoe mouth
Westworld kick a grip on a flow
And yo, right after this I get to fuck yo hoe
Young nigga, don't sweat that
Cause if you do, Andy Mac get the muthafuckin AK strapped
On your back with a goddamn slug in your head
Now you know the O.G. meaning of 'dead'
And right after I proved the point
Kick back and smoke a fat joint
Of green funky Indo
Then kick back and let a fine hoe
Suck my dick, bitch trick, when I say so

Down for all when I proachin by a stranger

She has to understand S.C.C. is family
She's cuss and ????? and is tryin to break the Havikk's heart
But understand girl you knew it from the jump start
I ran the streets keepin suckers off my homie back
Makin records and tryin to avoid gettin jacked
S.C.C. yeah it's a love thang
I don't slang but you're thinkin that I gang bamg
Cause I wear khakis locsters never say I love ya
And mean it in a strong way

Girl you complain that I'm quiet on the telephone
And that I'm rollin with the homies while your all alone
I disagree because I call you when I'm coolin out
I understand you feel up sad but baby check it out
Me and my homies have to make it on the city streets
With all the bangin and the slangin we depend on beats
And dope rhymes that keep us out the ????? line
You're so kind and I'm happy that you're all mine
But it's a fact, my homies always get my back
And like that, I'll never end up gettin jacked
we have time together when we using well
we go to dinner to movies then we get a tell
You understood from the start
I couldn't change overnight but I have a heart
So whassup, you're startin to push
but don't shove girl
You gotta deal wid dis gangsta love

[ CHORUS ]

Yeah you might think I'm out chasin women
But I'm wastin time in the streets wit my homies
But if you didn't already know baby
i´m dedicated to the S.C.C.
And whatever it takes to get us over this first priority

South Central's back in this muthafucka for the big Nine-Three
Dedicatin this to all you little young niggas

[ VERSE 1: Prode'je ]
Used to be my little homie from the hood when I came up
Chillin with the gee's, slinging ki's, tryin to clock bucks
Be a role-model when the locs wear the nine strapped
Didn't even think about the fact you were bum-rapped
Livin in the S-see 12 tryin to figure it out
Should I go to school, learn the rules, or should I drop out?
Maybe I was blind, in a way I was ignorant
Little knucklehead from my hood was still innocent
Coulda said, ""Loc, what I'm doin ain't the way for you
You should go to school, get a job and you'll make it through""
But I didn't do it, I was flippin tryin to be the one
Rollin in a 6-4 plushed on them things with bumps
Used to kick you down everyday, cause I had it, loc
Let you hit the bud' now and then, it was like a joke
You were goin down, then your mother tried to talk to me
But I was playin dumb and said I didn't even know you, gee
6 months later after doin 2 in county blues
Saw you at the park, khaki'd down, hanging with the fools
Smokin E.T., talkin about some drive-by
Lil knucklehead from my hood on a hoo-ride

A little knucklehead nigga
Just a knucklehead nigga from my hood, loc
Yeah a little nigga from my hood
Little niggas
Slow your roll, soldiers
Word up

[ VERSE 2: Prode'je ]
Now you're from the hood and you're running with the baby locs
Claimin rap-mob, slingin dope, and you're never broke
Got your own 9, and it's smokin every single night
Now I got the word from the streets, and it's nighty-night
Lil knucklehead from my hood on the downslide
Tryin to be the one, my nigga tryin to make it up high
Coulda told him this is nothing, coulda said him straight then
Now he's tryin to bang, and somebody's gonna smoke him
6 months later 13, and a menace now
Got a little juice as we chill with the pot crowd
Gettin fucked up off the E.T. and St. Ides
Tellin me that I'm the nigga that he used to idolize
Now you're like me ,little nigga
Better keep your finger on the trigger
Or it's 6 feet, little nigga
Cause on the slab it's a trip, and if you slip, you're a sleeper
But I'ma be my little brother's keeper
Put him in the spot, let him clock notch
Tryin to keep him safe from the 9s and the 12-gauge buckshots
But one day my nigga tripped
I caught him with a pipe in his mouth, and I flipped
Knucklehead nigga goin down in the hood, and it's bad for my business
So I had to just dismiss
Now he's back on the block
2 months later little loc got shot
2 in the dome by a fool that he jacked for a muthafuckin quarter
I guess times got harder

My little knucklehead nigga
Just a knucklehead nigga from my hood

One mo' time through yo hood and mines
You're walkin thin lines on these bomb-ass rhymes

With verses, we ain't in this game for the fame
We just like servin hoods like a muthafuckin hurricane
Muthafuckin busters, me and Twin puttin it down in '96
Tossin up tricks and crossin niggas like chop sticks
Shit I spit hits your ears and cause pain
Stressin out your frame like you got Slim-Fast on your brain
It ain't no thing to be a in-the-cut rider
And it ain't no thing to be a black godfather
Think of a nigga standin 5 foot 6
With some baggy-ass pants and some bomb-ass kicks
Twin gives a fuck, loc, cause I'm a rider
With my nigga Droop be O.G. Westsider

Had the swimming pool and at the park on deck
Even if you gangbanged it didn't matter what set
Doin flips, hittin dips, mobbin to the sto' later
Grabs the Bubble Yum, Jolly Ranchers, Now-Laters
Jesse Owens Park was the spot to hang
Retaliation from the shoulders is the name of the game
Didn't need to pack the fo', put the nine on your hipster
Bang and gettin high, slap-boxin, yeah, a g-ster
Manchester Park, I remember summer school lunches
Mobbin to the park off in bunches

You ain't the only brother out there fiendin for the kill
Playin' like a gangsta, you niggas better see
I represent my Loc and you represent yo' G
Cause players only prosper as you suckers bite the dust
And wonder why they died from the millimeter bust
Now you can be my 'cause, homie, I can be yo' Blood
But if you true to self, G, I got to show you love
They wonder if it's Crip but does it matter where I G?
I'm sick of doin' shows for niggas lookin' mad at me
I represent the small percent of real niggas
Never claim the hood even though I pull triggers
Now get directly at me, I'm not trippin' on the fame
I'm talkin' to my niggas playin' in this G's game

You playin' in the G's game
And homie, it's hard to maintain

Now recognize, open yo' eyes as I hit the switch dippin'
Sippin' on that St. in the cut reminiscin'
Cause deep in this game the mentality is devilish
You want to be a G, but you ain't even ready yet
Went to high school, dropped out, you couldn't handle it
Hangin' with them brothers had to knew was straight scandalous
Got it in yo' mind that you gots to pack the .44
Quarter on the hood, to stack a end you slang lleyo
On the run daily, now you're livin' foul
Mom's cryin' nightly, so she throwin' in the towel
I used to be a G-sta of em all, but bullets don't have bites
So it made a brother realize
I can be a G rockin shows

The gangstas move in town to built the ghetto back up
And all the bustas sweatin' Prodeje because I'm clockin'
I used to buck a fool, say ""fuck a fool"", but now I'm rockin'
The other dialect to put my G into perspective
And all that's bound to scare should come to get their ass collected

And now you on the run, you caught a case
You want to get your stripes, so you shot a Baby Loc in his face
Now face the fact retaliation, is a must, G
And if you slip, yo' enemies are gonna bust, G
And if you make it home, you're lucky
Cause ghetto warfare is leavin' niggas' minds twisted like Chuckie

And recognize the fuckin' games that you play with me

Got this mission that I'm completin, and niggas that I'm deletin
And I'm heatin up your block with the Tec and the infrared glock
Servin niggas with Mac-10 triggers
The bigger the nigga size, the bigger the hole he lies in
Cause that's the lifestyle I'm livin, so I express it in my raps

Perhaps the west coast is too hardcore
Kickin down your front do' with the infrared .44

Nigga, don't expect for us to let that shit ride on this side
Yeah, you're safe at home, but over here you best to hide

[ VERSE 1 ] 
South Central 
The home of true gangstas 
Down for all when I proachin by a stranger 
we chill although my girl gets mad at me 
She has to understand S.C.C. is family 
She's cuss and ????? and is tryin to break the Havikk's heart 
But understand girl you knew it from the jump start 
I ran the streets keepin suckers off my homie back 
Makin records and tryin to avoid gettin jacked 
S.C.C. yeah it's a love thang 
I don't slang but youre thinkin that I gang bamg 
Cause I wear khakis locsters never say I love ya 
And mean it in a strong way 
Girls on my jock you say I got it goin on 
And South Central the place that I call home 
The telephone rings but its you that I'm thinkin of 
I know its hard to deal with but its gangsta love 

[ CHORUS ] 
Yeah.. you gotta deal wid dis 
lalalalalalalalalalala

[ VERSE 2 ] 
Girl you complain that I'm quiet on the telephone 
And that I'm rollin with the homies while your all alone 
I disagree because I call you when I'm coolin out 
I understand you feel up sad but baby check it out 
Me and my homies have to make it on the city streets 
With all the bangin and the slangin we depend on beats 
And dope rhymes that keep us out the ????? line 
You're so kind and I'm happy that youre all mine 
But it's a fact, my homies always get my back 
And like that, I'll never end up gettin jacked 
we have time together when we using well 
we go to dinner to movies then we get a tell 
You understood from the start 
I couldn't change overnight but I have a heart 
So whassup, you're startin to push 
but don't shove girl 
You gotta deal wid dis gangsta love 

[ CHORUS ] 

Yeah you might think I'm out chasin women 
But I'm wastin time in the streets wit my homies 
But if you didn't already know baby 
i´m dedicated to the S.C.C. 
And whatever it takes to get us over this first priority 
right know yeah i see that look in your eyes 
but don't get me wrong 
I do feel deep and adore you 
And this gangsta love could be your love 
If you hang in there

South Circle,"*whispered* South Circle (repeat 8X)

Swervin at miznight I'm deadly
Holdin machetes for murder weapons don't look back nigga keep on steppin
Seventeen seconds from the slammer
But I'm badder than Montana droppin grammar like a sledgehammer
Deeper than submarines nigga take your last breath
Then catch hell like Lucifer when I be blastin Tecs
This ain't no freestyle it's real now
Stackin Penny's like Hardaway it's hard to play with the ill child

No smiles, strictly business as we hit the ave
Do a neighbor and No Limit did the aftermath
I mash, your field into half
Two crooks on the dash *it's all about the cash*
Crash courses with the sources of sin
No love for any woman, no love for any men
Adrenalin stimulates my suspicion
of good intention, cause these fools got ambition
Facin the fatal word, be on the lookout
You'll get took out, when me and Mike put out
dope, can't cope, we killin em
Now witness, the murderizm

South Jersey Seashore Lifeguard Convention Band,"I moved in that very day
The room was small but I liked it anyway
I watched TV while I dreamed through my mind
And the pregnant girl was busy all the time

September and October passed me by
I decided to go home for a while
I got a lift with an old friend of mine
I wanted her still, she reminded me on the way

So when I got home I went to see mom and dad
They asked was I ok, was I happy enough
And I smiled and I said that I was

A few days later I decided to leave
I couldn't find anyone who could take me
The only thing I could do was take a bus
So at half six I left to catch the late express

I boarded the bus with my clean washing over-night bag
I sat beside a girl all dressed in black
We talked and smiled most of the way
'till her jealous boyfriend angrily led her away

Then when I reached the house there was a party on inside
My friend came to the door of my bachelor pad
And welcomed me in from the night
As I was walking through the happy house on Halloween night
My friends were all there, my heart was glad
And my life felt actually alright

So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride

Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house

Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops

South Park Mexican,"First Verse:

My homie called me in the morning from a hospital bed
He got holes in his body from a glock full of lead
He said, three motherfuckers that his lady knows
Tried to jack his ass for his 84's
Now in a Ben Taub sick bed, my homie lays up
He got sprayed up, 'cause he wouldn't raise
Caught three of the seven of the shots that rang
Them folks sayin' that he'd never walk the same
It sounds like a job for the uzi gat
And where the fuck did your bitch say these fools be at?
For a real long time, we been the best of friends
And I'll be damned if a nigga don't get revenge
I feel anger, that I'm no stranger to
Bustin' slugs in they guts just a thang to do
Why they pray for you, come and spray they crew
Got love for my homies, I thought you knew?
He said ""Los don't sweat it, let this shit alone,""
but with these punk motherfuckers I must pick a bone
Now will it be the cranium or the chest plate?
Necks break back, snap, put him in checkmate
Lead take me to vengeance, send this
Ripping through tendons I end this
Because you bleed inside and it hurts to cough
I can't take no advice I gots to break them off

Chorus:

'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses
'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses

Second Verse:

My niggas check me, I'm thinkin' of a master plan
I'm straight up blastin' glocks, them fuckin' bastards ran
I'm steady missin' all my homies that done bit the dust
Got revenge 'cause them bitches wasn't shit to us
Now what the fuck can I accomplish?
And when I'm dead, will I find myself on God's list?
Every night I give, thanks I wouldn't die today
Turnin' cane into crack and my mic away
We dealin' 'cause we feelin' that the, pay's right
Hopin' Mama never see me at my, grave site
No daylight, play night cautiously
Could be death, or my freedom what it's costin' me
Lost in dear life my wife be that Mary Jane
And my streets got me strollin' blueberry Lane
Very same song sung in the South
From the mouth of a hustler, never have I trusted a
Trick or a hoe or a dope fiend either
'cause they smoke like a beaver buildin' dams on the river
Live a, life of a ""G' til' the d - a - why
Hittin' switches on the freeway high
Don't reply 'cause me don't give a fuck
What you hoes got to say about me Hillwood funk

Chorus

Third Verse:

Stop short in your tracks
Gats got the place surrounded
Sounded two warning shots, fuck on up and you'll be grounded
Pounded bodies with a bunch of twelve gauges
Now her face is too straight in the fuckin' dog cages
Pages of my book, turn like the wind blows
On the paper of a crook, muthafuck them hoes
Hittin' flows as a hustler, rose as a ""G""
Saves his flows to big 8, now he scores half a ki
Some say in his head he got insanity inside
But all it really be is mathematically inclined
Look behind, you might find others takin' over
Rookies movin' cookies, they whipped in baking soda
Baby learn the fuckin' rules, my cheese, is SOLID AS A ROCK
With my homies and we BALLIN' WITH A GLOCK
Tenderoni phony fraud motherfuckers
Best to get out the game, 'fore you die motherfuckers
Bustas trust us, but us hustlas trust no one
You can sure run with no gun
That be a nigga slow guns
So roll one of them sweets
Chug-a-lug on the eightball
And see where this motherfuckin life is gonna take y'all
And haters might fall

You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square

You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain

But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The

Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme 
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission 
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto

The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes

Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca
Puck checka, chuck wrecka, nobody do it betta

Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more

Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with,

If it gets long pick it up before three
But put it on silent so it don't ring

Is it real love or just a physical thing
Like a typical fling while I'm sippin on lean
Bring back some chicken cause a nigga Hung-ry

So the judges can win their elections
They locking up the muthafuckin Mexicans

South Shore Concert Band,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

A random act of senseless violence 
Was committed again last night 
It seems the whole world has gone crazy 
And something needs to be done 
So starting today, I'm gonna find a way 
I'm gonna repay someone

It's easy to give up but it's never too late 
A single step in the right direction 
Person to person making a connection 
We can change the world that's become so violent 
With a random act of senseless kindness

How I long to live the simple life 
When neighbors were still friends 
And the sidewalks leading downtown 
Were safe to walk back then 
The classrooms and the school yards 
Were havens for our kids 
Well, it's a long way back but we can get on track 
Today's a good day to begin

And sometimes those lonesome breezes blow
But it's no show so you might as well go
If you think you could win it 
Without losing and letting it show

Everybody knows your number
And you know that you could never be alone if you tried

And no place to ever arrive

And I know you think you found it

But you never get to count the loot

Ain't got half a pride

And the stars don't seem to shine so bright
Nearly everybody knows
Nearly nobody minds

You've been outside hangin' at the stage door
Wavin' at the limousines

It's the same Cadillac that they use
In a graveyard scene

Some other mornin' you go back to school
As if nothing has changed
Well, there's no use playin' if you're winning
At a losin' game

There's trouble in paradise
You're payin' for everything twice
Too much at half the price
A little too soon

Well, there's trouble in paradise

And you just can't close your eyes
In a solid gold room

In a solid gold room ooh, no
No, no, no, there's trouble

Mama thinks she's pretty and she's bein' kind
Papa thinks she's lovely and he's half blind

And the young folks lay on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them bad times away from my door

Brother Gene, he's big and mean
He don't have much to say
He had a little woman that he'd whoop each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night kickin' mama down the stairs
And I'm all right and I don't care

And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in the back

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

She wore red ribbons in her hair
Her soft skin was brown with blonde hair hanging down
Across the horizon the sun went away 
The moonlight lit the beach with the sounds of crashing waves

All down the south bridge the troops gather round
Waiting for the king’s word to take the village to the ground
We were just lovers caught in between 
A line drawn by war that never should have been

And she cried raise Southern Dixie your flag up to the sky
Must you battle till the last of you have died
I want my freedom like all the rest 
But to give my life out here is not what I find best

She was a woman like none I’ve ever seen
She’s pretty as premadona from a filthy magazine
The starlight grew fast across the sky
My fingers touched her lips a sin but pure delight

We had only moments but they seemed like hours
To hold and embrace before the bullets filled the air 
And as I look in her eyes the blood runs down her face
Just another loss of life oh what a human waste

You call me on the phone said you were leaving
You called me up to say you are gone
 You told me not to worry or come find you
You’re on the train headed for San Antone

The news struck me hard just like lightening
I could not believe that you were really gone
The news came quickly and decisive 
As you dealt down the verdict from the phone

I screamed broke down shouted hollered
Oh why did you decide to go
I fell to both knees prayed up to the Heaven
Thank you Lord now she’s gone
Get on outta hear-beer and pizza tonight boys-
Good time an ESPN on my TV from now on-
None of that soap opera stuff any more

Sometime I’d be happy with you staying
Other times be happy when you’re gone
I never liked the way that you loved me
I never cared if you come back home

Guess I’m trying to say good-bye dear
Guess I’m trying to say so long
It was fun while it lasted now it’s over
Have a good life in San Antone
