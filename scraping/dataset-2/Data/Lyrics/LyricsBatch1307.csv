50 Cent,"I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

Two niggaz in the front, two niggaz in the back
That's four niggaz riding strapped in grandpa's Cadillac
The voice in my head say fuck all these niggaz
Then I start thinking, I should rob all these niggaz

Man my homies they want do whatever I want do
I say I want eat they say shit we want eat to
Let's ride around find a nigga stunting on first street
With the shine's on niggaz be looking like lunch meat

I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor
Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start popping some more
Fuck a ski mask, man niggaz know who I is
I got a full clip and niggaz know I get biz

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'm up early in the morning, tryna make a move
You coming in here with me shorty take your lil' one to school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the lama to get this cake

Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
Oh, she don't know it, damn, okay we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
With a gun to her head saying, ""Daddy come home""

You was rolling, popping bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearing you
And the nine will jam, right in my hand

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I got his homies screaming buck you need to calm down
Niggaz be getting killed every time you come around
We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground
She asking God, what my baby dunn did now?

I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow

I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga lef'
G-Unit soldier I'm thugging till my death mothafuckas

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed",I'll Whip Ya Head Boy [*],2005

[Verse 1]
I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
50 shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that Chalk Gray Land
That nigga robbin and stealin everything that he can

[Chorus]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

Yeah I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in the Benz
Niggaz from my buildin always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right that niggaz get down right
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

[Chorus]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 3]
I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he rollin with Dr. Dre and Shady

[Chorus]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 4]
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin like he in the street tellin niggaz they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggaz out
That's the bullshit see what I'm talkin about

[Chorus]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 5]
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

[Chorus]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me",Talk About Me,2005

Nigga, things change

Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

Yeah, uh
Now walkin down the block without your weapon
Its a first class ticket to a lesson (uh huh)
I first cast tickets to perfection, me and Ben got a connection (yeah)
That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learnd that when i was in pajamas watchin Micheal and Madonna
Now i got the appetite of a piranna, nigga

Nigga, things change

Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder

The fact before rap, I ain't have a thing
I hustled, got my weight up, now I'm sittin' on change
I mean I got money out the a**, Maine

When n****z get the beefin', I be laughin'
'Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
""Now fool are you crazy?"" is what we ask 'em

But back to me and you shorty, decide, think
First I'll put the burnin', it's the G-string
Leave it up to me, we can do it my way

50 Cent,"Yeah, I'm f***in' wit' dis
It's that classic s***
That gangsta s***, yeah

Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out, sayin' what if?
Homey I play the block tryin' to get my packs off, sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top, damn what if?

If I got on some pretty boy s*** like Puffy
N****z in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
N****z would think I blew up my f***in' head and went crazy

If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bulls*** joints like AZ
Every chance n****z get, they'd try and play me

But I move around with a little 380
A n**** try to stunt, a n**** get sprayed be
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils

If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
N****z did say, ""50 that ain't gangsta, f*** ya""
Man I'ma just keep doin' what I do
'Cause n****z can't do me, better than I do, ha, ha

Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out, sayin' what if?
Homey I play the block tryin' to get my packs off, sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top, damn what if?

What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack n****z loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool a** n**** like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool

What if I was a low key n****, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homey 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
S*** I'd give that child support up with no problems

If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
'Cause I'm that n**** everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap n**** you didn't know
You'd be sayin', ""Damn that kid got a sick flow""

What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin' Curtis May field or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha, ha

Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?

When your index finger on the trigger and you pull it

All you gotta do is give a motherfucker one reason 
Blood stains on the ceilin' 
Same place he stood, thats what they leave um 
Dont black it out, lets just squeezn off with your gun

And say what's up to the sarge

I know a spot full of n tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
To Ace to the duece, and stumbled off mad

High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro
Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'

Yeah nigga, you don't want it with them their bigger
Cross us, your on somethin we bare niggas

Freeze up and you'll end up in your lawn
It's the protege of 50, inspired by Biggie
Burns more than Ziggy, them lil' niggas dig me
I been stressed out lately, so I'm smokin more than ever

Stuntin in Testerossas, stylin in front of vultures
Ma quickly to call us, baddest bitches they know us
After the show they blow us, and do all type of shit to us
Now I can speak for me 'cause me everywhere I be
Niggas know I'm a G, got it locked got the keys
We move from bundles to D sippin on Hennessy
Buck rollin the trees, Banks countin the cheese
We get the paper then breeze, nigga we overseas
You stuck in the hood, aw that ain't good
Different town, different tour, different telly, different whore

I keep on losin shootin dice and I'm sick of this shit
Clientele still poppin so the junkies keep comin
And my neighbors is watchin but we still gettin money
On this block till the sun drop I don't have a home
I will not stop, sellin rocks, thug till I'm gone
Got a couple old schools and some iced out jewels
Some G-Unit shoes, body full of tatooes
'Bout to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lips
Tell him talk that shit, now y'all wanna trip
I keep it dirty on the East Coast dirty on the West
Just a dirty lil' nigga with a Glock and a vest

50 Cent,"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires

And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins

I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?

The drama really means nothing to me

And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier then Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cause I'd get tired of looking for ya, spray ya mama crib
And let ya ass look for me

If there's beef cock it and dump it

Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains

If there's beef cock it and dump it

Ha ha! (Ha ha)

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your a** up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your a** up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and b****in'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the f*** is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the c*** of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherf***er hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right

Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

[Gun is being loaded and than cocked]",Intro,2005
50 Cent,"[Proof]
Barely raised by my dysfunctional fam
Here I stand as a dysfunctional man
Quick-tempered, short-fused, and pissed at God
Demons pullin at my soul 'til it's ripped apart
Secret's out momma that fire I started it
Fuck the fireman logic of the closet by the wire shit
What's positive about a father that bust nuts then wussed up
And a momma that don't show her son enough love
Shit, that's why I run from my first son
And force these chickenhead bitches to get abortions
I'm married to game, my mistress is fame
My girl Paq the closest, she know I ain't gon' change
Go insane in a world evil as ours
I done shot at houses, people and cars
The deeper the scars, the worst is the history
God you ain't gotta forgive me, just don't forget me, you hear me?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay, on top
I recall memories, filled, with sin
Over and over again.. and again

[Proof]
And most importantly I'm tryin to support my seeds
Can't seem to get away from them courtin fees
Embroidery, on my hood across my heart disorderly
Breakin in houses of people who ain't got more than me
Accordingly, I move in error
Gotta face the fact though I can't fool this mirror
Neglected my daughter and tryin to blame on how I was brought up
like I'm a product of this environment, why ain't I shot up?
Got up today like ""Why you let me breathe again?""
And with each breath I feel death is creepin in
Thinkin sinners are winners and I'ma finish last
My pen and pad record my life as each minute pass
Passin minutes, I shook sin and shook drugs
I did right by you but still you took Bugz
Then caught me in adultery, fought me
for not knowin through the dark streets you walked me, talked to me

[Chorus]

[Proof]
It's the bliss that's a rush so rush my wrists in the cuffs
It's like a fight for yo' attention and love
Speakin of Bugz, give me a hint from above
If he not you know I wanna be sent when I'm done
Kid outta wedlock so my lady's frontin
I love Em, cause he gave me somethin
A positive anything is better than a negative nothin
I was on the edge of death ready to jump in
It's hard when you can't find love anywhere
And just because the reverend listen, don't mean he care
Pops on crack with a sufferin past
I dream in black and white, the world color me bad
Other than sad, painful and stress
Life is good with the webs that, tangle with death
Control the border, control the school
I have sinned amongst men and my soul is yours, yours

And imma always hold you down that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin' what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess what I'm tryin' 2 say
Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
You paved the way for young black women of prosper

But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus]

You remind me
Of a real love
(you don't 'ave to worry)
Real love
All night long
I'm goin down
Dododododah dododododah
Reminice on the love we have
You are everything but without it baby
What you gonna do without
My life, my life, my life,

And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's

No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite

I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

I don't need your love, no no no no

Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope

Promise me, you’ll be around
Hold me down, I’ll build you up

Listen, if you let me, I’ll be the reason you shine
It’s the secret, I want the world to know that you’re mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I’m writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I’m from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I’m special
Not rap, I mean me, that I’m special
You know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I’ll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it

Your smile makes me smile, I’ll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I’ll pick out some shit
One pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it’s more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
'Cause I know with you by my side there’s nothing I can’t do, yeah

In the palm of my hands, fiending

But quickly to be scheming if you choose to front on me
That leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing
And I hope they stop breathing
Because if they do pull through, in the hospital beds

They'll be squealing, talking to these D's man
They don't waste no time, they want answers

I was busy tryin' to pump cracks in the black blocks

Poppin' shit to my homeys about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got back a black glock
P ninety hold ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked

I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad it was itchin' my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of them ran
And some of them dashed were good and some of them jammed

Saw shots fly by me, no, I shouldn't been trippin'
The Pulp Fiction must have been God's divine intervention

Wouldn't thought then from that, I learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to perfection
Uncle La got knocked the feds hit it with seven
And left me with the fifty cal and a mac eleven

Start everything from everything from heads to the worries
And had half the hood damn near wanted to mirk us
Found myself askin' God what the fuck is my purpose

Niggas will jack you for your car, I don't care what you whippin'!
But I'm gonna tell you like this, I don't play no games
I was built for this shit and I can take the pain!
Through my whole life course I've been off the chain
And niggas knew I been broke way before the fame!
I been havin' crazy thoughts, of murder a nigga
Ooh, I wish a nigga would! I don't take that shit!
If a lot of talkers are less, walkers that's rich!

A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag

See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'Go get 'em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryin' to fight momentum?'
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm

To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her

And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest

Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck

I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad

We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari

I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit

Buck got the shotgun
50 got the mack
Spida got the streeper
And you bound to hear it clap
You won't have another birthday cake after that
'cause yayo got a temper and he don't know how to act
And I've been gone for the winter
But now a nigga back
To get the money the money the money the money the cake
And you motherfuckers looking like steak
Food on the plate for the wolves
Follow wolves
Don't get moved by the tools
Battle wounds on you shoes wait
Control you hate
You ain't riding in them 6's
(why?) 'cause you spending all your cake on them bitches
I need the bread lil' niggas need Christmas
Banks don't rap with a back pack
I'm in it for the money the money the money the money the cake

You heard banks said so I know I got the mag
I pull up pull out spray hollows at your back
I don't give a fuck
It's going down like that
I done been through every hood
Dead niggas gone rap
In the heart of a victim murder is monumental
I don't complicate shit, yea I keep it simple
My bullet wounds will tell you a story bout what I been through
South side trauma drama with gallamas
I conversate with killers it's usually about life
Politic with lawness it's usually about white
I'm the poster child of violence
I'm the boy on the poster
When the shots start to rang out I'm the boy with the toaster

Yeah listen up chicko
I hustle I get dough
You fucking with a sicko
I spazz let a clip go
Cannon out the rental
Beam to you temple
I squeeze blow your mental
All over you friends

Me I'm from the street
We ain't nothing sweet
The home of the homies
There's a body every week
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the cake in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
Can't a muthafucker breathing tell me I can't eat
Show me the money the money the money the money the cake
Niggas slow down pump you breaks

No mistakes
Cause the jakes
Run the plates
Then you headed up state
For rolling round with a steak
Niggas start up the beef
And run straight to the cops
You're a bitch ass nigga
The cup cake of the block
Any nigga disrespect the click getting shot
Round here niggas get found upside down
Ova' the money the money the money the money the cake",The Cake,2006

Ha ha, 50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT
(Here we go again, yeah)
Uh huh, ha ha ha
Does it make you mad, when I switch my flow
You can't understand, how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire, 'cause Shady said so
(Here we go!) I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush, to try and get the throne
I just get on the track, and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt
You may see something else, I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song, recycled
We all much rather get along, than fight you
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin' you faster
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka' that wants ta
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk
When I walked up to you, like ""Ja, what up dog?""
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then
When you were standing there with all ya men
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on

[Chorus: x2]
I, know, you don't want it wit me
You, know, you don't want it wit me
You, talk, but soon we goin' see
You, don't wanna bump heads with me

(Tony Yayo!) You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuard Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buying a new pistol
I clap at yo ass, wit this chrome .38
And put six through ya hats, that's seven and 3-8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe, you bleed on the turnpike
You know and I know, who took ya chain
You got robbed two times, so ya ass a lame
I there to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies, with Steven Segal

[Chorus: x2]

(Lloyd Banks!) Fuck that I'm tired of hearing
These industry niggas starting to get outta hand
Like I won't find ya whereabouts, by stomp-ing 'em out ya man
You killing New York, even in Comp-ton, they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out the van, and
They see me pop up on icy, cause I could
You den lost yo money, prolly forgot yo way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid, it's hard to make good songs
How you want it wit' us, when half your artists got makeup on
Every magazine I open, you on ya knees, taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothing about what pain is sucka
I put yo ass to the ground, like a train conductor, motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, nigga!
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit!
What the fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?
'Cause we move units, uh huh
And don't think we ain't billing you

I need a real love Mary hollar at me if you need a real thug
We could ride through Compton to see real blood, real crypts,
And imma always hold you down that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess wat I'm tryin 2 say
Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
You paved the way for young black women of prosper
How you paint pictures
You deserve grammies and oscars

'91 I stepped in this game
After 'what's the 411' things ain't been the same
And I can't complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

Hate it or love it,

(And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops)
Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Hate it or love it,
(The underdogs on top)
(And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops)
Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

(And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops)
Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

You remind me
Of a real love
(You don't 'ave to worry)
Real love
All night long
I'm goin down

Reminice on the love we have
You are everything but without it baby

Ride wit me
Come ride wit Trice, man
I brought my man wit me
Curtis Interscope Jack (ha ha)

It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different

50 Cent,"I'm focused, man

You should know this, man

Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city, any town; touch down, I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby; I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationalist; you should know what I'm about
When you look at me, baby, you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before

It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them, baby, bye, fall back
He's so good, and he knows how to love me
But so hood, and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude, and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say:

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me
Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class, when they talk, we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

The more I get, the more my ambition tells there's more
I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Ya friends try to confuse, but you know what
My intentions are good; I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could; you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby, you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm ya man

I can hear your call; it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy; I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy; I just can't leave you alone

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want

I can't leave him alone

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore,
Do you want more (more)
Do you want more (more)

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

Now what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more)

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Gang bangin' is real, homey I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg, C-walkin' on top of the devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse, about this and that
Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep jibbin' and jabbin', I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clackin', your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be, Spike Lee, of this gun clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'
In the dope spot playin' John Madden
Homey I ain't braggin', I took five

I got my L.A. Dodger fitted on, I'm doin' my thing
Got me fuckin' with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville, I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta - more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now who got the Juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I take off your roof
Leave yo' ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homey I let the 38 special ripped through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm startin' to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records

50 Cent,"I'm focused man
You should know this man

Yes one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle my business
Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a great conservationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

So when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it (oh)

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

The more I get the more my ambition tells there more
I'll move an A for that girl I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
An be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man

If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy I just can't leave you alone

[Repeat: x2]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game

Now work it, go ahead grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it

Now get to work it

If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

Well, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know

You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshalls come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed every time I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep, we can creep tell me where should we meet so you can

take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

Well, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know
I got that fire ('Cause I'm the flyest chick around)
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

Now are you really ready
I said, are you really ready
I make the temperature rise, now don't be surprised
I have the ice on, stuntin' heavy
I got a helluva flow, you should already know
Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers god forgive me for
Tellin' lies

You wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, im'a don you gonna know I'ma don
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say ""50 we love 'em""
Without them, there's no me so I love them
Man their the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best so perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stress'd, I'll pass the test
Every time I drop, I'm burnin' hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

Don't wanna see you smile baby

I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

I'm gettin' the feelin', you wanna take revenge
From the conversations, we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz

It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact

So every time we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazing in the sack, eyes slanted like you're Asian
But you're black, God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back, you'd understand why dis feel like that

And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin', she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down

Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down

What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual

Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggaz
When you tease 'em with your physical

Got you laughin' in your shower cap
Let's get it on

Shawty if you love me like your lost and you can't find your way without me
You goin' wake up one day when I'm gone thinking why did you doubt me
But you better believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top
You got to believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top

I made you why would I play you?
Not only showered you with gifts I bathed you
Plus I hit the first night and I stayed too
I know it's early but I just thought I would page you

Hey you!
More then I'm willing and able
You get tired from all the presents that I gave you
Still you

Be acting like you someone faithful
You swear I'm fucking on a rendezvous
When you think of freaking I be on my girl
Even when we not freaking you be on my mind
I'm more mature I'm flipping them dollars

So I can't give you all of my time cause I'm,
24 hours a day stuck in a war
Atleast 8 hours or more cooking them rhymes up
So 16 hours just you can hit the store and you complaining you want more free time?

[Chorus]

You got to believe me baby I'm making it easy baby
My SWA you watching Feezy baby
I got a mean Mercedes and got a cleaning lady
Heres some advice for you, you better heat it baby

Long as your whip in the room and got a strip on them booms
So what the fuck do you care cause I live on the road
I'm busy gripping them Ole's that's how you gripping them clothes
Home I ain't getting no dough I can't be sitting in there

So what they worth is they own baby I'm different then them
I bring them benjamins in look at the kitchen in there
Look at the living room set look at that thing on your neck
Matching that thing on your wrist but got some digits in there

I give a fuck if they stare I give a fuck what they think
I get them budgets in check and put the diesel in there
Don't let them people in there
Gas you up and get you all upset
You win my heart and I'm a keep you there

[Chorus]

And since these feelings at heart are not right I,
Put in position to rock ice right and,
Them other niggas be singing the same song they might,
Have what it takes but they handle things wrong

You in your mens or something you want the meaner man
You got to believe yourself cause I believe in me
I got the Beamer keys I'm just as clean as these
I smoke the greenest trees
Them other niggas be fronting

Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins

It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

Shawty you don't have to take your panties off

If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break ya off

Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
If you fear heights when I'm high hell yeah I'll go low
It taste so sweet, that sticky cotton candy
If you get carried away
We'll be starting a family
This is a perfect time for a magic trick
Good humor is no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now that's the first half of my act
I started out like a pimp
Now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper just don't fuck with my stack
Oh its like that
yeah its like that

Shawty you don't have to take your panties off
Just move 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

Stand up or get on the floor
Its on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break ya off

Now you can ride the horse round the carousel
Explosion, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test girl, I don't fail
I work it out, without a doubt
There's plenty water rising sure to get you wet in the pop
Have your luscious seductions considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle
I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak
But I'm being sincere
Your pass is valid all summer my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There're so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lolly pop
Forget that, grip that, ride it non stop

Shawty you don't have to take your panties off
Just move 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

Stand up or get on the floor

I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass

With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga

Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy

'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son

Bang bang

Bang bang
I shot you down, bang bang
You hit the ground, bang bang
That aweful sound, bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Don't nobody want to die, but everybody want to ball
Somebody gotta go, when them killa's call
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it
The streets talk, the beats mark, 'cause that heat comin'
And if they know that you did it, you better keep runnin'
I think I see sumthin, there go my enemy
Only lord knows where this nigga f'nd to be
Tennakee, still the price is as real if you look it
Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it
Nigga anything goes, my shop never close
From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo
The real niggas feel me, the haters want to kill me
But I'm holdin' down my city, me and this 9 milli
While your throwin' bricks, and hidin' ya heads
Homie, I know where you hang
Ain't no thang to walk up and let that chopper go...

Bang bang
I shot you down, bang bang
You hit the ground, bang bang
That awefull sound, bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Now all the gangsta's pray
Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me
Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me

Just think if I ain't empty the clip, and he killed me
Would I still be livin'?, would my homeboy's miss me?
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to?
Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me
I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast
That's what you get, bitch

Bang bang
I shot you down, bang bang
You hit the ground, bang bang
That awefull sound, bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Now all the gangsta's pray
Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me
Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me

It's goin down around here nigga
Get ya muthafuckin head bust
Them muthafuckin street lights go out
And them real niggas come out
All the bitch niggas go in the house
Just not a game, man
Don't fuck around and lose your brain
And hey, all my real niggas pray

Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me
Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me

Acting like my money ain't no good in the hood; you know what I mean?
Fucking head blown off, nigga; you know?

I'm the topic in every barbershop and beauty salon
Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on
Cause 50 this; 50 that; 50 stay with a gat
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the MAC
But when I come through, shh - the talking stop
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
Or the hoes I got - catchin' stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, you love the kid, 50 on that killa shit
That big mobster bad man; BGF guerrilla shit
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
So if you with me you gon' eat, and you gon' starve if you not
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha
I'll turn your kids to a shooter
Crip niggas love me like they love Hoover
They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you
They ain't used to a G like you, BOW!

You think you a killer but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel so nobody hear it
I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne
Shooting these niggas lights out like LeBron James
Holla my name; give me a reason to see you bleeding
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we even
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, ""Do your dirt all by your lonely""
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends; just cut the checks
I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass out the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that

Ice came through on some shit and bought him one

Buck came through saying ""50 show me some love""
Sold him a dub dub something he can sneak in the club
Gave him some shells for that trey 8 snub
He gave me some bud I gave him a pound, gave me a hug

Got my thinking cap on, now I'm sharp as a blade
Don't believe me you sit there and watch me get paid.

Stricktigic I show you motherf**ka's my chess move
Believe it I'm not that rapper nigga you used to
That hammer hit that shell that hollow tip will go threw you.

I prepare for the worst, and wish for the best
40 cali on my hip, caline on my chest
It's simple math niggas get blast, D's canning it up, see the crime from the DA, mad as f**k.

Man Sonny a fed joint, he half way out
He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house
Correctional facilities don't correct shit
'Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit

A shoot out in 89 fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you see how he talk
Should shoot the Shepard in the head and da sheep gon? scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters

I asked about Bones self-esteem, he said he was soft
Said the boys up in Odasville was breakin' him off
Can you picture him in a jar, niggas jokin' him up
Treatin' him like a pin cushion, pokin him up

He came home actin' like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class nigga to see God, uhuh
Stuck his chest out tell a niggas we don't back down
But wait until we find out Sonny?s background

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down

My nigga LOC?s comin' home soon he up there in four dicks
It's on when he touch that cause he can get enough bricks
When I was young he told me not to run, I pop my gun pa
You can ask gun or la la love then aim hard

I'm interested to hear ?bang? back in the days
They ain't better than my brain, young crime is pay
New Cadillacs and Bonneville's the very next day
I just hope he learn, I ain't have much to say

Lead us squeeze the life out you like a boa constrictor
Fuck a headlock, I'm talking bout extortion nigga
Apply pressure, its hot get the fuck out the kitchen
When niggas pay ya every Friday you ain't got to stick em

At the dice game if ace roll a six its no problem
But if you roll a ace he gon pull out a Robin
Losin' a little or lose lot, when niggas is starving
Man the drama in my hoods goin' down regardless

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up

Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down

Everybody know education shot Jamal over short paper
You on the run you want a nigga hit son hit take it here
Rise got shot up over some punk shit
In the club beef with some niggas over some dumb bitch

They say wooly was caked up off some credit card scams
Got him the permit, the nigga took the money and ran
Heard he was outta town ridin' round in the pound chrome spinnin'
Caught him spending 545 I no lie ask how

Get to point blank range and fire

Motherfucker get in the way of my bread
Then I'm goin' load my shit then cock my shit
Nigga trip I'll come for yo head

[50 Cent]
I'll have your nigga in an ambulance tellin' ya hold on
The choir in your funeral singin' you so long
The top shotta that rock product the block gotta
Then pop hollows then pop bottles the whole spot up
The mo' paper the mo' strength we goin' get it

I'm in the store copin' shit you ain't seen before
Black card swipe, we galore

I said these niggas stop talkin' then start worryin'
The FEDS keep comin' the money we burryin'
I'm in a mean loft, I'm in the Cream Porsche
I let that thing off, then turn to T-Wolf

Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains

I toast with ya - if ya got a cup
Hold your fuckin' bottle up, I really want a model but
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut

I'm just playin', unless you goin' do it
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it
Ain't nobody bleedin', I guess it's all music

Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German

How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me)

She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain

[Eminem]
Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song

How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on

I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on

You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends

Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in

Arms and legs in the garbage, cause the rest of her, I lost her

I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

Look up at da stars she like, honey where the roof?
Pull up, hear the dogs, canaries dey go on roof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on the roof

Dat boy had it hard no facade, it's da truth
So now when I menage and get massaged just to proof
Proofs in dat pudding & dat bakin' sodas takin'

But dat were batter den roofin' dat shit be bad for ya skin

Niggas was ruthless and Lord knows dat I've sinned
But I thought about my future in the loops like a pin
Walked out on da gig and I turned to da streets
Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks

I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me
Mothafuck 'em all and sweat from my balls
If I drop anotha album I did dat for my dogs

10 Maybachs everybody ridin' big
I just sit back like, look what I did
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer everybody back to business

People lookin' from a distance think I'm big daddy cunk
Reincarnated spirit of a G
Beef'll make you dinner take a seat so we could eat

Caught up in da rapture off of gunshots and laughter

Homicide is zooming and nigga you lookin' funny
Women love to stare 'cause dey know dey see da money
I open up my mind about openin' bank accounts
Deposit a 100 stacks break up now take it out

Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but I just like to give
Used to run da street, young nigga bare feet

The Codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester she transfer to Florida state

Cooking like home-etch for financial aid
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid
Remember mean time, my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the penitential states

'Cause she used to fight with her moms
Till I sat 'em both down, now she's tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm, now she know she getting sliced
Spending nights in Milan

Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
With the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe the weather, boss

Naw please, don't confuse me, miss
I'm tryna see, I could put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit

And that's straight up real talk
All bullshit aside, she replied, ?I like to do the wild thing?

Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses

50 Cent,"Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, b****es hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just f***ed around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus]

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
N**** on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f***
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf***er I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the s***
I gets what the f*** I want so what I trick
Fat a** burgundy bags cla**y s*** Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a b**** move

I’m up now, it’s your loss
Must suck to be you

History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself
And what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
Never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind everytime it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfucking-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you
Fucking men, you say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is going down
You must have just not have been truthful from the start
See, for me it’d be nothing
To say you never had my heart, but I’d be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a ""relationship""
Ships sink, and you know it's love
As soon as you fall in it, ‘cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by, and we only spoke twice
I’m sitting in your driveway, calling you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m calling your cell phone
You answer, but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know? It should've been time to go
A long time ago; I kept holding on
It's comical when I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwing
I wasn't catching your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowing over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shitting all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're going to

I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back
Knocking on my door all dolled up

‘Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye bye)

Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You’re options are leave or put out; granted your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feeling smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinking about who's loving me
I’m thinking about who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splitting
You don’t think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you!
Ain’t no secret, no apologies, you keep it
Now that I’m doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It’s my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you
A million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money hungry hopeless ho
You fucking with my focus, so
Go back to that chump that played the role before

Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinking us, hope you float
Lying through my teeth, I hope you don’t (Drown! Drown!)

Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show, let them show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughing, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothing is what we are
No beginning, no tomorrow

Mami caliente
Borracha los dos haciendo cositas diferentes
Yo te veo y tengo un deseo, móntate en la nave pa darte un paseo
Con su meneo, meneo, meneo, meneo
Ella me calma y yo me olvido del tiroteo
Tiene trucos, hoy anda en el mercedes buscando quien la descongele
Ella llega a la mansión tres niveles
Y en la cama (shhhh) caliente (shhhh)
Se pone agresiva y no hay quien la pare ella enseguida quiere hacer maldades

Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing livin'

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away

No place to go

Nowhere to run and hide

But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though!
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Gettin' money regimen
Wit' my gettin' money machine, nah what I mean?

New York times
Come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressed in a mess he's smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that
All I do is pray for that
This the city god told me, 'go and make it' at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick
That's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We don't make it prime time till we dyin'

Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
To show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
City's you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em till the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad

Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think 'nigga better you than me'
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet ain't got a name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, niggas won't clap you in
We watch the side bitch talking like she a main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

My old school candy painted
I hustle hard
When I come through they like ""oh my God that nigga clean""

From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby

Shoes and the belt buckle Louis
We don't need more details now do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gonna need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time, nigga, what's good?
Domino's, motherfucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt
I'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip these set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit

Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the old block
I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop
I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace
Designer threads in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin'
Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?
We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't notice this a Queens thing

It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded
It's 50
When I come through you see me
In the Suburbans that's bulletproof, bomb proof, level 6, what else?
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up

Blood drip stain the ground, bug it down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip, letting off
Somehow we end up in the same shit

And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn murder lathers a birth place
Facing the city, quoting Biggie all on our worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger
Living from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she just kinda blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured out, everybody wants riches and them cars
But she just wanted a better family
Because her parents divorced early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe us
Then she gave her to her uncle, her brother played the saviour
Until the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fucking up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothes
And forcefully started choking her, telling her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talking lower and she told me, ""Come here""
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with the aim to kill
And said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face

I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure
He told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and hours in notice to find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im
But take this pardon
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
The woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch her
And if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka
One day, he was on the block rolling
Then, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, ""Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, from when you fell off in the road""
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, ""I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressing, I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you""
His mom says to him, ""I hope you know your pap was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm saying fails
You see, your lil' cousin out in Brooklyn will be relieved
I know she love you but the story's more deeper
Uh, you see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her, so confused, she would lace an old poke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been living this mission
You tryna figure out who's the nigga or the perpetrator of killing your pops, nigga
When your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga""
This anger was dwelling all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started gripping his nine and uh
Before he knew, he aimed it up at his momma and uh
He shot her right in his spine, he said
""This is why, my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in trying?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my ma
I know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive""

Cause kids contradict themselves when they be rhymning 

Sounding like shit, off beat with no timing 



[50 Grand: ]

Now soon as I touch the paper, see you later 

I shut your lights off like a blackout 

So hit the circuit breaker 

I'm the worst trouble you ever had 

Vocab like knife stabs 

Comin' wild killin' in a paragrah 

Holding niggas ransom, it runs in my blood 

Maybe my grandson might be wild like Charles Manson 



[Keith Murray:] 

I be the gimmie, the got ya 

Been blastin' niggas way before the remix ""I shot ya"" 

The proper hip hopper, fading em in the Palladium

After the sunshine comes the rain 

Hold up, wiat a minute, let me back up and just explain 



[Hook: ]

I been all around the world

[50 Grand:] 

Nigga your life means nothing to me, challenge L.O.D. 

The average nigga style sucks like a hickey 

50 G, the M.C.'s brain buster, mic crusher 

Dirty money quicker picke upper, crew duster 

Now that L.O.D.'s up in this motherfucker 

Leave a known rapper with Broken English 

Like Smooth Da Hustler 



[Keith Murray:] 

Some thing make a nigga laugh, make his ass cry 

He rolled a seven 

I bet it all he turned around and rolled snake eyes 

My thinking cap is bigger htan a fuckin' Sade's 

Stay all-terrain, rainin' on all parades 

The street is my bed and the corner is my pillow 

I'll kill your fuckin' ass and for your crew I'll do ditto 



[Kel-Vicious:] 

I'll leave a nigga dead, and stinkin' take his soul 

Cha-boom, cha-boom fill him up with holes 

Natural born killer, iller than the rest 

(Where you at?) East coast to west 

I keep it real kid, I freak the flow until it's naked 

Niggas get paniced and frantic and can't take it 



[Hook]",Love L.O.D.,1996
50 Grand,"Yo  you think them niggas out there impress me? 
Don't none of that shit impress me 
Oh  I'm supposed to listen cause they on the radio? 
Psh  I'm ready 

I got  nothin' to lose in the world to gain 
I leave you slain and make your family relocate and change their names 
Like the West coast say  I'm bout the macolay
Niggas be slippin' when I be flippin' and I'll see you next trip 

Cause revenge is a motherfucker payback is a bitch 
Especially when I'm coin with that Def Squad click 
Can you relate to an intense, motherfucker 
Gridiron mic cuffer, terror to the jugular 
Smother all the others, punk motherfuckers 
But I'ma keep it real, cause me and you is brothers 
It'll happen so fast boy you won't stand a chance 

Cause the L.O.D. put in work like red ants 
And when I walk by Curtis Mayfield'll draft 
And spell the full limp love is just like Shaft 
Shit I craft, is harder than Chinese math 
Plus I lay you down for standing on Dangerous Ground 

[Chorus]
Aye yo you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
I said you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
Aye yo y'all standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
Yo kid you standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 

Let's embark on this mission like Black Indiana Jones 
is eatin' Pookie sandwiches and smokin' chronic bones 
See I kill it a little, then leave it alone 
Let my man 50 G drag it into his zone 

Now 50 Grand's in the room and Legion of Doom 
And if you sayin' Def Squad's the bomb then I'll assume 
It's takes brain splittin' compositions, makin' incisions 
Dranin' the blood up out silly niggas, like morticians 

Now I'ma mack out and pimp the rhythm like Too Short and Dru Down 
And wait for what go around to come around 
And beat it in the head with this, send em off into the unknown 
In and out of consciousness, kind of like 
a hip-hop microphone hypnotic 
Specialist in gettin inside artists, sick word analyst 
World's most foul freestylist 
c'mon man y'all niggaz know y'all can't get with this 

[Chorus]

And kill the noise playboys cause we have no flaws 
We employ hits the whole family can enjoy 
I'll be masterin' the Funk like Flex, mentally 
Etchin' and Sketchin', speakin' with my hands like Terminator X and 
scheme and get choked out like Radio Raheem 
My team'll put you to sleep and let you dream 
I'm not down with the East West coast controversy 
Me say you you say me, across the country makin' millis 
I'll be glad to see a brother get paid for hard work 
But instead y'all steady tryin' to ditch up the dirt 

Yeah niggas still tryin' to toss salt in the game 
And y'all done read my name graffitied in the walls of fame 
Let me explain niggas die for fame in this game my name's 
like a migraine, rappers get banged out the frame 
See some funny style niggas in the house tonight 
With posses too thin to win, and too light to fight 
Think twice 

[Chorus]

I had the last watch and y'all niggas on the corner pumpin' gas 
Nervous like you lyin' to a polygraph 

Come see a real show, cut off your flow, killin' you slow 
One time for L.O., I'm like a thief, in your window 

Or catch us in the streets, herdin' like cattle 
Defeatin' rappers without contracts and battles, swingin' like Mickey Mantle 

Niggas trippin' like they want to be me

Some nigga loading eject bullets like floppy disc
Some niggas talk like they will but they the opposite
Thugs and thieve with a dozen keys
Serve quarterpounders that don't come with cheese

And know they telling lies when they see the judge and plead You honor it wasn't me he get lock
And as soon as ya boy get hot
He start right where he stopped
Can't go on the block with a knot in ya sock and don't glock
Without making by way to getting got or get shot

Ain't no such thing as gratitude on my avenue
Attitude adjustment we all need
I pray to lord two inch starters will in me
Come from the heart that's why boys are feeling me
I den whipped up soft and brought back some orgies
This is for my niggas in the jail, my niggas on probation
Knowing if they violate what kind of time they face
Hustling anyway minimum wage ain't nathin
You want cash right now, huh, fuck being patient
Live life every day like it's yo last day
Smoke some weed; dump your problems in the ashtray
On Sunday shine yo glass like cascade
Fuck moving slow, hop in the fast lane

When I call you on the phone
You're never at home
You been gone for so long and I feel so alone
Your love of money gone ruin our relationship
But you say it isn't and that's a lie
[Chamillionaire]
Girl I ain't trippin' I Know that you're feelin' alone
But I feel you should know I'm still in luv wit my dough
And since they say time is money
I'm wastin' my money sittin here chillin' so good bye

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
She love a trick to treat
She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat
I'm Sorry, but I gotta radio interview to do
I gotta hook up with Milla Mack, and Greg Street
Maybe we can retreat, to get a bite to eat
Take a night to sneak, to a tight lil' suite
You can invite some freaks
But get it right I'm cheap
You could leave, with tonight's receipt
Makin' moves wit hatter
Ke'Noe and Dobey, BeBe and Jabber
When I'm not in the lab
You know I'm trying to grab a
Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for
In the morning
When I hook up with Killa Mike, Lil' Jon and them
All of my calls, I'm gonna forward them
To the answer machine, please call again I'm busy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm Still in Luv wit my money
I'm still infatuated wit my cash
Ain't no need for relaxin' and chillin
I'm Stackin, and Killin' on a grind I mash
But I still make time for my lil' mama
But I ain't got no time for a little drama
I'm tryna pull out in drop top
Throw 22's on a lil' somethin' foreign for the summer
You can call me but I ain't gone answer
All this stress gone cause me cancer
Imma call up whodi in the club on and throw a couple dollars on a Dancer
So don't hastle me, just leave me alone, quit callin my phone
You say you an independent woman, then stand on ya own
Baby girl I'm gone, holla at me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 50/50 Twin]
Get Mad, I chase cash
Do you contribute to fillin my stash
Smellin your piss bitch, go buy glass
Never deposit, but withdraw fast
Co-Dependant trash
Act with class but poor doin bad
Got a senada, can't afford a jag
I'm the best thing that you done had
Stumbled upon a gold mine thought you
Stuntin' with that dolce I bought you
An additional time gon cost you
Speakin gibberish are you
Who gave you permission to trip
You gon trip,take a trip
Car, plane take a ship
Music grind stand right here
Ten mill you might get recruited
The world don't twirl around beauty and booty
It twirl around cash and music
Cheer people up and help them through shit

I pull up with the top droppin' like err-err-err-pouhh
Ladies don't ride wit me I don't blow the AC, 
Cause my next chili like the third member of TLC. 
Put me in a old folks home if you talkin' bout gettin' some bucks 
Cause my wallet got senoir citizens in it, 50's and up.

My neck wrist and mouth stay below 22, degrees 
Please cheese no cash is what I'm bout,

I got to keep my pockets fatter than Andre 
The giant my rims pokin' out like wings but my car ain't flyin'
Look forget what they talkin' bout the water boys be true, 
My bill phone is thick and chunky kinda like beef stew.

Cause I'm ridin' on the type of glass that ain't see through, baby

Boys be perpetratin' purple, they gotta stop actin', 
More cars in my garage than 5 o-clock traffic. 
In Houston I keep an iron in case I gotta stop static, 
Like shoes tied together you trippin' I gotta pop at it.

Ey they say where it if the shoe fits so I found out 22's did. 
Without it the games empty like the space in Lews tooth is. 
Big rocks and a wrist watchin', the F-P-D's watchin', 
And if gettin' money's illegal, ey I think I'm a need Cockren.

All my mind in all time who thinkin' money over music. 
Smell ya grind time so these bustas cant do ya. 
Its the water boy bafoons go and lock the game. 
If its a hall of fame gone stuntin', go on and hang our name up wow.

21 years in the game I spit 21 payin' dues

A little high, little low

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Nigga sent me some beats...But I don't want that

I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh...you doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass

You ran your mouth like a bitch
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques
You ain't no soldier boy
Take that tat off your stomach

But bitch you love my money
Now if greed come between me and my niggaz
May god bless his soul
And I hope he forgive me

And I don't fuck around with you niggaz
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggaz head
Sayin' ""what's wrong with Slim?""

Just like we started with crack
We let a couple niggaz shine
We bought to take it back
You know its mic's now nigga
We started with gats
Let a nigga play me on the streets

Balling is a habit over here, at Paid In Full
Want you to know that, g'yeah

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic
My life is fantastic, maculant extravagant
Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

[50/50 Twin]
Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't want to get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

When my car, is changing speed
I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires want to hang with me
R&B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls want to take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'ma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'ma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth
I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate
I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us

No spending ends, in gentlemen's
Strip clubs, it's just for spinning rims
I want it now, I get it then
Cop it drop it, cop it again
Not him again, not Bennegan's
Treat a slut for what, not fin to spend
For bitter Gin, and dinner when
I can get up in, her little friend
Rewind, back to fact that you
Get attached, to the bachelor
Cause the fact, that I captured the
Green back, she unstrapping her
Bra strap, getting back in the

Water gun'll be splashing for
The girl that hops in, right after her
Riding mayn, in a Lac with the

Strapped with him, and that's because

And I will fly to higher ground, high above the clouds 
See the stars up closer watch the world go round,

And all emotions that turn and go

That we do not know

Go you where feeling is strong
Work your heart easy
Set your love free

And if you get lost
You can always come back to me
You'll worry about the future
Sometimes deny your past
Waiting for an answer too afraid to ask

You won't sleep some nights
You won't breathe some nights
You won't ever find any peace
Some nights and you'll say why me
Why me? Oh, why me? To me

You'll jump in the fire jump in the sea
Sometimes you'll think how bad can it be
Don't let it fool you, don't let it move you
Don't let it change who you are

You are young, you are loved, you are all on
And if you get lost you can always come back
Can always come back to me

She had ever loved had been taken

And when she passed away

You can't stop all that love that I got
Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it
Bring back the better days for me baby

You gotta bring 'em back cos I'm going crazy
I go insane with your name up in my brain
Things will never be the same you ain't up in my frame 
So what you gonna do what you gonna say
Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way

And round and round my mind,

I know what to do when I'm not with you,
I fill my mind with thoughts of you and I, You and I.

It seems to me of love is what you bring,
It plays on my heart strings,
Songs of love, To be loved,
Got me thinking of,
Of moments that are gone
but will not fade,
May live be to replayed
in my mind over time,
Like thoughts of....

We're just five guys who want to rise to the skies
No we got a vision in our eyes
Now people want to step up and try to hold us back
They want to try to stop us getting freaky on this track
But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing
And this is how I hit you w/ the funk that I bring
Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect
And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check
'Cause everybody knows what goes around comes around
I'll put it down w/ my sound
Reminiscing bout the times we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out memories die

Keep movin' on
Gotta keep movin' on
Reminiscing bout the times we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out
Memories die
Keep movin' on
Gotta keep movin' on

Reminiscing bout the times we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Reminiscing bout the times we used to share

I'm trying to keep my two feet on the ground
Constantly surrounded everywhere I turn I'm hounded
People stop and stare and look me up and down
Now you shouldn't feel down from what everybody says
And don't let it bother you if anybody stares
'Cause you know that at times people can be cruel
Try to put you down make you feel like a fool
But you got one shot now don't you ever stop
Keep your dreams high keep reachin' for the top
'Cause you know and I know if they had the chance
They'd be climbin' up on the stage trying to dance

Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

Questions I can't answer got me going round in circles
Make me feel as though I'm losing self control
It's feeling like a dream to me. I've lost a touch of reality
Deep inside I've searched with my soul
Now it's good to keep searching and bettering yourself
But don't push too hard 'cause it's bad for your health
And running round in circles will always get you dizzy
And thinking too much that will make your head busy
So just sit back and relax, you gotta chill
I promise that all of your dreams will be fulfilled
One day if you keep on looking you'll find
You just gotta go with your heart and your mind

'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore

Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin' is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive, therefore
You must never let it live

Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard
For all of those who don't understand what I'm talkin about
You're trapped in my helium of evil thought, figure your way out
Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,1999
60 Second Assassin,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter

Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and checks and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, reacting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs, what

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments, left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken punches that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams

Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back and pack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams

That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine

Verse 1:  Thrill Da Playa 
Hello? 
(Hey baby, what you doin'?) Playin' tetherball 
And eatin' cream out the middle of some Oreos 
I meant to call you back last night 
But I was watchin a video of an Evander Holyfield fight 
Next time you see your friend Michelle, 
Tell her if she ain't fake, one of my boys want to yell 
Anyway, that's enough of that 
When we gon' hook up, so I can pack the kitty-cat? 
Oh, now you want to play the switcheroo? 
Well call me back when you gon' let me hit the coochy-coo 
Just because I play the Babyface 
Don't mean that I'm a punk that won't hang up in a lady's face 
Oh, I thought you might change your mind 
'Cause a fella like myself, I must admit, is hard to find 
You coulda stuck with your ex-man 
Just to chit-chat and talk about wedding plans 
'Cause I ain't gonna talk respectfully 
I talk reality, and how we can fulfill your needs sexually 
The kinda stuff that'll make you wonder 
And callin' me is cheaper than a 976 number 
And I ain't tryin' to run game 
I belong to you, so I ain't tryin' to prove a damn thing! 
So we can do whatever, but now, all I 
want to know is, when is we gon' get together? 

Chorus: 
I hope that we can get together soon (3x) 
In my room, yeh, drinkin' a bottle of brewww ... 

Verse 2:  Thrill Da Playa 
So when you gonna let me get ya hot? 
We'll get some wine, food, and a room at the Mariott 
What?  Filet mignon and Parignon? 
Well I was thinkin' more Dom and lime potato chips and (?) 
Baby, I ain't bein' cheap! 
But if we gon' be workin' out, we don't need to have too much to eat 
I'm sure you need some work on your thighs 
And for sure my third leg could use a little exercise 
Hold on a second, hon --- 
{speaking off the phone} 
Man, can't you see I'm on the phone, runnin' game, tryin' to get me some? 
What?  If you're gonna get perverty, 
Then make sure you bring back a freaky-deaky friend for me! 
{he comes back on the phone} 
I'm back, baby, sorry 'bout that thing 
But my boys let me know I was next on the cellular game 
But anyway, onto bigger things, and better things 
Like kitty-cat and ding-a-ling 
I really hope you're hearing me, and at the same time, 
I hope you ain't gettin' the wrong idea of me 
I'd love to take you to a picture show 
But it's cheaper to stay home and watch it all on HBO 
'Cause if we home and we take it, 
We'll get the hot-buttered corn, and watch the movie naked 
So baby, let's go to my room

I was visiting Atlanta when I met this strip dancer
now love was the question and shorty was the answer
she was dancing on the stage in her lingerie
and I think I heard the DJ call her Sauncerea
body route around the pole on her hands and her knees
18 half black and half vietnamese
looking like she taste better than Koloa and milk
with the dirty red complexion skin smoother than silk
so young and so tender she made all me a stare
getting paid to make love to a kick in the snap
as I sat up in the cut just for waiting my chance
to solicite Sauncerea for a private dance
yo I could still remember seeing days in the made
wishing she would just hurry up and enter the stage
so this hundred I been saving for my P.I.P.
I spent slowly and Sauncerea would dance for me
with a body flowing slow like a smooth poet
it tosses gave my mind like some cool more wet
and decided we together like the birds and the bees
a match made in heaven like some O's and D's
no I never met a girl so sexy and fine
she can take a man's money especially mine
and on top of all that plunk control his mind
with the way she made her dairyiare roll and grind
plus I never thought I answer an executive club
see a sexy strip dancer and get expensive with love
'cause to love someone you don't know it really ain't smart
but in certain situations you just follow your heart
'cause in reality she's probably got a man of her own
but I could fantasize as long as I got to for a song
and 10 dollars is a small price to pay when you love
a sexy strip dancer that you met in a club

(chorus)
they turned dollars into dimes and dimes to dubs
mesmorized by your brothas when I enter the club
and though you strip for tips I place no one above
my sexy strip dancer doing strip club love
and no matter what they say I'm gonna love ya right
even if the love only last one night
she's just the cream of the crop and I place no one above
my booty shaking beauty doing strip club love

(69 Boyz)
girl if your beauty was a dollar you'd be richer than Trump
'cause you better than a supersport apolloing home
if I could choose between the chance to put the ring on your hand
or a platinum presidential with baguess in the band
ain't no choice I'd rather have you than the finest of jewels
for you I travel over heart throws minus the shoes
rules there ain't none 'cause I'm caught in the mix
like a herowine junky shaking needing a fix
and everytime I see you dance I get lace in my viens
an all type of loss again erasing my brain
'cause my heart says love but my mind say lust
and it's hard to decifer what emotions to trust
'cause if I trust an inner man then it may just work
but there's a 50-50 chance I could end up hurt
and I could trust in my flesh but if I move to fast
my first time could end up being my last
so I ask what kind of playa like myself fill your head with a word
or tell you anything that you ain't possibly heard
when I'm already knowing each and everynight
you hear game from the guys and girls are light
it's just a thought but maybe all my wish would thought she be bitch
'cause a girl like yourself is probably already hitched
it happen but you just dancing trying to get you a lick
or maybe you in love with the attention you get
either way Sauncerea the choice is yours to make
and everything your momma gave you girl is yours to shake
and you can shake it till you break it or the cows come home
or till all these other niggas here cash is gone
and when we finally get the chance to speak as a pair
and the beeper number is all you can spell that's cool
'cause Ima beep you like a pimp then sit by the phone
waiting for the chance to make ya all my own

Your tender hands caress my head

This jaded man's not who I am
I've touched the flame and I've been burned
All I need is a second chance
Give me eyes of a child
And teach this man

Teach me all over, all over
To relearn love
Show me again
So I can relearn love

You gave me the greatest gift of all
And it set me free

Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

Memories of your love still linger on inside of me 
A recurring dream 
Visions of you return night after night so hauntingly 
I lay awake 'til four or five without you by my side 
I never knew how much you were a part of me 
I was a fool, so unaware yet now I see 
So many words I never took the time to say 
I guess you don't know what you've got 
Until you've gone and let it slip away 

After we said goodbye 
Baby I finally realized 
That I just cannot walk away 
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart 
And you come to me. Every time that I close my eyes 
You're all that I can see 
I am never free 
Even when I'm asleep I feel your presence here with me 
I try so hard to just hold on 
When I wake you're gone

So many words I never took the time to say 
I guess you don't know what you've got 
Until you let it slip away 

Although you've gone away 
I tell you my feelings never change 
I'm missing you every night and day 
And it's driving me crazy baby 
My love for you remains 
I'm tired of playing foolish games 
I know that I'm the one to blame 
And I miss you like crazy, baby

In the light, and I be seeing these girls be looking pretty
That's why, I got to stay on my grind
So we can be a hundred percent, all the time
Y'all don't know where we from (where we from)
Y'all don't know where we been (where we been)

Its like one for the money, and two is for them hoes
Three is for the drank, Four pass me the smoke
You won't see me riding, in any ole Benz
Unless its jet black, on twenty inch rims
I got more Air Force, than the government
Every color pair, I'm so fly trust me I'm loving it
I never leave the hoe, with just a single rubber
And I crawl like Ringling Brothers, hoes love us
Under the in-fluence, catch me swerving
Playing in a number six, like Julius Irving
My watch and my chain, got me coughing and sneezing
Still a young heathen, as long as I'm breathing
I pay for a show, turn it out then I'm leaving
The way the man told us, its flossing season
This year we got it made, we shining y'all
Even though we got a due, we still grinding y'all

Who am I, name is Lil' Flip
And I roll with, two clips
Just in case, something happen
While y'all niggas yapping, I'ma be capping
Rolling with my strap and, pistol packing
Glock 9's, Tech 9's, even a Mack 10
I'm not acting, I pack clips so
Play your roll, and stick to the script
Before I flip, and empty the clip
I'm Gladys Night, cause I'm a pimp
We eating shrimp, and catching planes
You know I'm great, at catching dames
And what's your name, where you live
Will you give some brain, do you got kids
Cause if you do girl, its okay

We still in it (believe that) it's that flame shit

I'm sitting 24 inches, off of the ground
How that sound, mama said o what you'd like
Hold it rocking flights, red, white and blue stripes
But hold up, down South still on nonstop
Cause we been representing down here, for a while
With no solo album, I was still amazing
Stayed full of them trees, I was purple hazing
Look at me now, Redd ain't playing around
Two skinny, but my stacks keep weighing me down
They say balling is a habit no, I can't help it
Now I got more green, than a Boston Celtic
So I'm going all out, on a money route
Now I think these niggas, really know what I'm about
I don't know where you been, I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

See I'm a flosser, balling like you see it

When I hop out the truck, why'all catch my drift

We ride the finest cars, you know we stay stunting
Rims so big on the six, they sit funny
If it ain't broke don't fix it, blunt it and blist it
In a all blue something, with the plates unlisted

Don't get it twisted up, my wrist lit up
You gotta show me something, for me to get up
Just call me a rough neck, but I cash enough checks
To put me in a Vet, and roll off with a set
The streets give me respect, for everything that I did

Yeah, take a look into my backyard
Where there ain't no way out, and niggas want to act hard
Watch your friends, some turn to fakers
That's why I smoke green acres
Get your paper, look around the world is violent
I, do my dirt and move in silence
Come on, you seen them capture, heard them sirens
Just come outside, boys are fighting
Yet the, grass is green, mosquitoes biting
So I grabbed a pencil, and started writing
About the the shit we seen, the shit we did
And how we live, just growing up as a kid
Down in Houston Texas, its hot as hell
I know its hard to gain, easy to fail
Now days, anything might send you to jail
Take note, this is show and tell, in my backyard

[Chorus]
Oh I never thought, that it would be this way
Living in the ghetto
Who would of thought that I could make a change
All I ever wanted, was to make it out this game
Living in the ghetto
I kept on trying until I found my way, my way

[Yung Redd]
From the porch to the street, from the street to the sto'
From the sto' to the corner, where a nigga sold dope
Put it together, this left niggas with no hope
But it seemed to twerk the block, work or stay broke
Oh no, back then money was slow
Wasn't cool to be bold, believe it I know
Wasn't no field of dreams, couldn't get no sleep
When cops popped the pistols, in the street
Now let's see, the ghetto's been shooting at me
Tell me to freeze, before I can stash my cheese
Some of us get caught, some make it out
Day in and day out, on a paper route

[Chorus]

[Yung Redd]
Waking up with the roosters, can't do what I use to
Like wasting time, fucking with losers
This is what goes on, way down here
Tell it like it is, we stay round here
All my niggas, get paid round here
Sometimes, people get sprayed round here
Hey, days and nights, nights and days
I use to dream of ways, to get paid
So now I'm, looking around to see what's shaking
Opportunity knocked, but my spot was vacant
Boys on the country, locked up for hustling
Game over, we just got time for nothing
You might see niggas yelling, always fussing
Around the way, this what happens everyday
So just put up your guards, times is hard
Live from the backyard, from the backyard

Let me state my name, and show my skills
I'm Lil' Flip, and I got that deal
But I keep it real, with my peeps
And I hold my heat, when I'm in the streets
But I can't stop and I won't stop, rapping till I'm dead
Cause every single day, I got ideas in my head
Like trippling my money, and doubling my fans
I did shows for hundreds, but now I'm getting grands
But I give thanks to the man, for giving me a talent
Cause I could still be hustling, trying to feed my family
And y'all think its a fantasy, to want to drive a Benz
But if you get that car, how you gon supply them ends
And you gon want some rims, and you gon want a house
But when rent come around, nigga why your lights out
Now you sitting on the couch, all slouching and mad
Cause you acting like you balling, but you really doing bad
But trust me dog, I've been down the same road
But what I learned, is that you can't let money control
The way you act, the way you talk (the way you talk)
Your attitude, and the way you walk (the way you walk)
The way you feel, the way you think (the way you think)

Just do what you gotta do, to keep your bread up
And watch for your friends, who always want to get you high
Cause that might be the one, friend let you die
Sometimes I cry, yeah nigga I cry
Because half of the people I loved, they already died
Like my cousin, I can't forget my best friend
And my mama's mama, so everyday I'm stressing
But I went and got a tat, for all the people I love 
And money won't change me, I'm still a educated thug
Riding 20 inch dubs, even though I didn't want em
But Hump paid for it so fuck it, I'ma flaunt em
And I'm still in the hood, giving money to the kids
But I don't want publicity, for all the shit I did
But I did it from the heart, not to get famous
Cause I been having paper, and it'll never change us
And if I ain't in the hood, that mean I got a show
That's why I stay on my grind, cause I gotta have dough

Made sure he understood everything was cool

"70, Girls, 70 Cast Ensemble","The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

Nothing ever stays the same
Surrounded by pain and empty dreams

And you gave nothin' in return

Is when you wanted to lay up

But after so many dreams deferred
I saw you for what you were
And that was someone who really didn't care

Why were you for the ride
I just can't let you get back inside

And now you're wantin' to make it right

Like I should up and let you in
To my open arms again
I don't think so, not a chance
I am stronger now thanks to you
I've turned a negative thing into something positive
Now I know that I can live 
Without the likes of you around

And now you swear to god
That you have made a change

I think of all the pain
You unnecessarily 
Brought on me

Opened it slowly and started to read

And this is what she told the gathered round

7th Ambassador,"Destination: ?
Trapped in the dandie's lion with a pit of lions
World crying, inside, what the fuck's goin on with me?
What's goin on? What's goin on?
Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo

Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard
For all of those who don't understand what I'm talkin about
You're trapped in my helium of evil thought, figure your way out
Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,1999
7th Ambassador,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwellin in path for mental confusion",Elements (Writing Rhymes With a Liquid Pen),1999
