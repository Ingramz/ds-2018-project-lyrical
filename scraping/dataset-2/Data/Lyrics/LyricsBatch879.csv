Rando Owen,"They like ice cold beer and smokeless tobacco
And dancin' on a Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin' and talkin' to Jesus
There's some that say that that ain't right

I know for certain that nobody's perfect
And they don't pretend to be
I like those people
And they like me

Well, they may roll the dice
But ain't life a gamble
And you may think that's all wrong
They take what they're given
Hard work and hard livin'
Right out of some old country song

Jokes that they tell you
Might be off color
But sometimes that's just what you need
I like those people
And they like me

They don't kick you when you're down
Judge you when you make a mistake
They're the first to come around
Help you at whatever it takes

They're the salt of the earth
Honest as rain
A light when your world turns dark
And if it falls on your shoulders
And you need to hide out
They won't tell a soul where you are

Yeah, they stick together
Like birds of a feather
Treat you like family
Hey, I like those people
And they like me

They don't kick you when you're down
Judge you when you make a mistake
They're the first to come around
Help you at whatever it takes

Hey, it's ice cold beer, smokeless tobacco
And dancin' on a Saturday night
There's church on Sunday mornin'
And talkin' to Jesus
There's some that say that that ain't right

Hey, but I got a feelin'
God up in Heaven
Thinks that's the way it should be
I like these people
And they like me

Yeah, I like these people
And they like me
They like me",I Like Those People,2013
Random Axe ,"Carnivorous slang, I feast on flesh
Orangutan, banana clips, beat on chest
Dirtier than Ms. Lewinsky's skeet on dress
I'm beyond blessed, heater in the seat armrest
Defeat your leader, we the best
See the rest is just clones, hip-hop drones
Singing the same old song
Fuck with this, you can't go wrong
By these standards, I can't even put a Kangol on
My ego's big, I'm crazy, I could do Cee Lo's gigs
Kush homeboy, zero mids
Who gives a fuck who your hero is
I give that nigga a nice view of himself where he can see both lids
Bar for bar, I'm on par to spar cigars
Whole preserves coming straight from jars
You get drug like CVS
You got no buzz out of state, Metro PCS

Random Impulse,"They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish,
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.

Randy,"It's time to pack, load the van and go.
Hit the road again, do another show.
We try to sleep or listen to the radio,
Might as well get comfortable we've got a long, long way to go.

If we get there early, we park the car
Then we try to find out where the record stores are.
Then we unload our stuff and hope we get some food,
Which always taste like shit but we try not to be rude.

Me and the boys ain't afraid to raise our voices
But we hardly ever act
It is sad but it's a fact,

Then it's time to play, oh man the crowd is crazy.
At least the two drunk punks, who ever said that punks are lazy?
When the show is over and all of the people has gone,
We talk about the gig and all the mistakes we've done.

Me and the boys ain't afraid to raise our voices
But we hardly ever act it is sad but it's a fact,
There is much for us to do, to tear down and build up new,
But we speak from all our heart and that's a start.

I never thought we'd go this far,
I mean, we even got our own car
And it takes us where ever we want to go.
We get to play in lousy bars
And hang out with the superstars
From the local support act.

Randy,"Another war, a thousand dead
Passed from the screen into my head.
Upset for a minute but in a while
I change channel and my anger is replaced with a smile.

Suffered destruction of my mind,
The same as the rest of all mankind,
Blockades the head from everything
That makes you feel guilty, sick or sad.

Still I believe there's got to be a way
That makes everybody feel O.K.
But when I listen to what people have to say,
I think it seems like they are all afraid
To react, and take stand

Against this ignorance, that rules our world.
Infect people's mind, with virus you can't find.
A gigantic reformation of this whole society
Is the only way to see the end of this malady spreading rapidly.

Keep up your spirit, keep your dream,
Keep up your hope and self-esteem.
Try to react on inequity,
Together work to achieve equality.

Suffered destruction of my mind,
The same as the rest of all mankind,

Randy,"When I was younger me and my friends saw the Exorcist.
Thomas got so scared he couldn't sleep for days,
He wouldn't listen to me when I told him its not for real,
I told him it's make believe

And that there is no heaven or hell
Even if dio sings about it so well. So well.

Even though no gods exists and I'm an atheist
The Exorcist got me so scared, got me so scared.

Some years went by then came ""The heretic"" Exorcist 2,
Starring Linda Blair and Max Von Sydow too.
It had none of the mood or the tension,
It was not a worthy continuation,

A category be	
And a big disappointment for me. Oh me!

Even though no gods exists and I'm an atheist
The exorcist got me so scared, got me so scared
Since then I've seen a thousand films
None with same tension and not to mention credibility.

In 1990 came Exorcist 3,
Based on the novel legion by William Peter Blatty.
It was not as bad as I thought it would be,
Not as good as the book but it was still worth to see.

In a God or Spirit that's never been seen.
Just made up to exploit and deceive
Every weak human intellect, try to see

It's just another instrument to oppress
The poor and strengthen the upper class.

I can't see how the fuck you can
Buy this shit, try to understand
This is just another fairy-tale
But you swallow everything anyway.

But I have hope for humanity
We're all equipped with a mind to see
Through this bullshit hypocrisy
Made up to fuck up equality.",Holy Shit,1999

But I know when I'm talking about love.
You say I'm just an immature kid who's always, always looking for trouble -- Looking for trouble
Can't avoid it if your trying to be heard.

We got so little to lose and so much to win,
Why don't we realize how fooled we have been?

Why do we sell ourselves for the price they give?
Ooh, they let us down but we forgive.
Now it's all for one and not all for all.
The greed keeps the people, the masses in control.

We got so little to lose and so much to win,
Why don't we realize how fooled we have been?
We got so little to lose and so much to win,
Why don't we realize that greed eats from within. -- From within

'Cause I believe that we can make things better:

Now, now -- Now and forever and for everyone out there.

In school I fucked up every test.
I was never ever best
On anything and I had poor grades and a terrible hairdo,
If you where fifteen in the eighties so did you.

I'm not good looking or well dressed
But I'm more naive than the rest

This one is for the people that believe in a fight,
This one is for everlasting dream to be free,
This one, this one is for liberty.

This is a loading gun mission,
With words as our ammunition,
A mental revolution unviolently.
This one, this one is for anarchy.

There's no strength where there's no struggle,
Without struggle there is no strength.

This is the result of frustration,
Total boredom but we still find motivation,
It's not much but it's a start.
This one, this one comes from the heart.

This is the call of the useless generation.
We await the fall of the great nations.
The flame of freedom burns in our eyes.
We had enough of fucking lies.

Randy,"When you look back on our history,
All you see are war and misery,
Caused by humanity,
Controlled in the hierarchy.

But I don't agree, we're not born to be
Evil, corrupt, inclined for tyranny.
Instead I, would like to claim
That we're changed by...

The powergame that they play.
Oppressing masses, preserving classes.
Institutions to confine, revolutionist in line
Yeah, make the people blind.

When you look back on our history,
All you see are cults and mystery.
Constitutionalized hypocrisy
To silence demands for...

Democracy that they fear.
So they're oppressing masses, preserving classes.

Randy,"I've got to tell you about a strange, poor man.
I met him at our concert, now he's a legend in our band.
Claimed we had to sell him a T-shirt for one mark,
I explained we really try to be as cheap as we can
But that didn't get through to that man.

Yeah, it is cool that you believe in me, but you have to understand
We're not Peter K., Emma, Gandhi and Marx reincarnated as a punkrockband.
And even if we found our major enemy
In the core of this capital dynasty,

We're still a part of this goddamn money machine.
Right after the show, strengthened with a bottle of wine,
He said to me: ""Diese T-shirt ist ja mein,
You capitalistische schwein"" !!

He grabbed an empty bottle of beer
And aimed right at my head,
I got scared and took shelter right behind my own amp
And the glass swished above my head.

Yeah, it is cool that you believe in me, but you have to understand
We're not Peter K., Emma, Gandhi and Marx reincarnated as a punkrockband.
And even if we found our major enemy
In the core of this capital dynasty,
We're still a part of this goddamn money machine.

But it's so fucking hard to be
The perfect human that you demand of me,
But I want everyone to know that we really try to practice what we preach,
But I guess the reason for this fight is just your own bad conscious that bleeds.

Yeah, it is cool that you believe in me, but you have to understand
We're not Peter K., Emma, Gandhi and Marx reincarnated as a punkrockband.
And even if we found our major enemy
In the core of this capital dynasty,
We're still a part of this goddamn money machine.

Oh baby, now I see that from what that man did to me,
I could surely have made the funniest song that the world's ever seen.
But still now when I've found I'm the worst storyteller around,
I will keep up my reading, I will keep my pen bleeding 'til everybody's free.",Randy I Don't Need You,1999
Randy,"Look at this fucking world, everybody wants to be on T.V.
Is five minutes in the spotlight supposed to make you feel free?
Anything goes, the price is high if you want to be seen.
Some people do just about anything to get their face on the screen.

This society treats celebrities and so called stars like fucking gods,
Even though the majority of them are fucking frauds.

They hear it on the radio and they gladly sing along.
They watch it on their television screens and they don't think that it's wrong.
That's right!

Look at this fucking world, people do anything to get on T.V.
A nose job and plastic breasts guarantees a place on the screen.
What kind of sick society can accept something like that?

How can anybody say that they own a piece of this world?

It's all up to you, it's all up to me,
Things don't change by themselves you see.
Its our responsibility to act,
To make sure that the environment stays intact.

When it comes to saving animals to cut down the murder amounts.
For others it's hard to see the easiest of things,
As the pain and suffering the meat industry brings.

Some choose to see just what they want to see,
But to put the head in the sand has never worked for me.
I try to examine myself for deficiencies,
Be as strict as I can be then find the remedy.

There are not many good things that I've done
Giving up meat is most certainly one.

You are what you fight for, your actions and your thoughts and words.

There's still parts of me that I don't like,
I watch way to much T.V., I drive a car instead of riding a bike.

I'm not proud of being white and I'm not proud of being man.

They only serve warm beer rice and beans
But it feels just like it's down in New Orleans
Brace yourself baby I'm here to attack
Down at the place called the Chicken Schack

The girls at that place are mighty fine
But stay off sadie green cause that girl is mine
The moonlight shines through the holes in the wall
Everybody there is having a ball
They don't care that the place looks like a wreck
Down at the place called the Chicken Shack

The people sit quiet except for one boy
He's humming and singing on a simple melody
He said this is a song about being free

In the city of Stockholm they're reclaiming the streets
Everybody's dancing and stomping their feet
One guy is shouting in a megaphone
He said this is ours and ours alone

Come on everybody sing with me
This is a song about being free
The days of submission won't last long
This is a freedom song

Oh, here it goes!

A russian girl on a summer holiday
On a Greyhound bus through the U.S.A.
She said so this is how it feels like to be free
Well the weather is nice and there's so much to see

Come on everybody sing with me

Days of submission, oh no, won't last long
This is a freedom song

Oh, I gotta sing it!

I was broke so I sold my time
They got me working on the production line
Five days a week from 8-5
I had to struggle hard just to stay alive
I sold my time, oh yeah!

I had no faith so I sold my soul
And all it left me was this big black hole
Now my souls's gone and I don't care
I never even noticed that it was there
I sold my soul - he sold his soul

I even sold my family
Just to get prosperity
And a safe economy
And I don't need no love
I don't need no love, love, love, love, love
I don't need no love, love, love, love, love
I don't need it

I felt alone so I sold my heart
I bought a friend and thought: ""Hey! this might be a start""
But he was too much so I sold him too
Now I'm alone again and I don't know what to do

I never hit, I never kicked, I never injured anybody in anyway at all
The only battles I fought were the ones inside my own four walls
I fired bullets of words, names that I called that only made you feel small

And every time the shit hits the fan, I'll be gone away with the band
A life with love and a love for the van don't always go hand in hand

But the beat won't go away, in my heart, my enemy
All the same if I go or if I stay

New countries, new cities, new streets but never did I see them alone
Me and the boys go 24-7 through 24 different time zones
In times like these nothing scares me more than the sound of a ringing telephone
Bad news I can tell on the voice that it's a message from an unhappy home

Sometimes I'll be happy, happy and ecstatic
But more likely I'll be drunk and dramatic
Truces were few and far between
It's been that way since we were seventeen

(unpaid bills, times that we spill, don't you know those pills can get you killed)

Mujeres, discoteca, bailoteo, manoteo
Soy una gárgola...
Las mujeres se dejan envolver
Reggaeton de moda convertido en el perreo

Es que la noche esta buena
Why mas buenas 'tan las nenas
Que cuquean por la disco 
Solas, solicitando why solteras
Se mueren por reggaeton...
Why le da con perrearme prendida en candela
Ella busca activarse, sin pensarlo soltarse
Llama fuerte la atención pa' ver quien la complace
Le gusta los diamantes, flow de gangster
Curiosa por si suena algo interesante

Soy una gárgola...

Reggaeton de moda convertido en el perreo

Suelta, why lo que veo no lo creo
Ella rompe bien la cintura why me juqueo
Se da cuenta why me sigue el maquineo
Le bateo, la rodeo, llevándola de paseo
Otra gatita gárgola, que no sabe
Que antes que amanezca me la tengo que comer
Porque soy una gárgola, me mantengo en lo oscuro
Seguro, porque voy pa'l cuarto nivel

Me encanta salir de noche
Yo no le temo a la oscuridad
(Oscuridad, oscuridad...)
Amigo soy de la noche
Aunque me rodee tanta maldad
(Tanta maldad, maldad...)

(Porque yo...)

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!
Lo único que, ahora, junto a Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Estas son ""Las Gárgolas: The Next Generation""!
Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen

(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24

Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

Si saben que con nosotros no salen

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Si saben que con nosotros no salen

And all it left me was this big black hole
Now my souls's gone and I don't care
I never even noticed that it was there
I sold my soul - he sold his soul

Randy Bachman,"Born and raised in a prairie town
Just a kid full of dreams
We didn't have much but an old radio
Music came from places we'd never been

Growing up in a prairie town
Learning to drive in the snow
Not much to do so you start a band
And soon you've gone as far as you can go

Winter nights are long, summer days are gone
Portage and Main fifty below
Springtime melts the snow, rivers overflow
Portage and Main fifty below
Portage and Main fifty below

All the bands in a prairie town
Try to outdo the next in line
Learning records out of Liverpool
Dreams of England on their Minds

On the other side of Winnipeg
Neil and The Squires played the Zone
But then he went to play
For awhile in Thunder Bay
He never looked back and he's never coming home

Just a band from a prairie town
Sometimes we'd drive from coast to coast
One call from LA and we'd pack and fly away
But in our hearts we're always prairie folk

Looking back at a prairie town
People ask me why I went away
To fly with the best, sometimes you have to leave the nest
But the prairies made me what I am today",Prairie Town,1993

Mother has no time but she cares for me
And she cries all the tears
I am joining now the river flow

I am three days old
Now the time has come, you have to be a man
I don't want to destroy
The only chance I have to survive down here

The wind blows, I'm so scared
And the waves so big, I'm not prepared
I will have to be strong
But for now I cry all the tears

Now enter the storm and feel electric sword
My entire life is about to burn
I am struggling, life is illusion
But I keep the dream of a better time

This secret knowledge I receive from where I am
So precious, the treasured icons
Extended to this point, forget the ones that hurt
They all want, they struggle, they fight and try to dry their tears

We're all left on our own
We are bound yet by each others lives
Now I'm leaving this world
I will never forget the river flow

The pains and traps of life
I put my scars away and love
I have to face the truth of living
I left my boat behind, I am not taking it
Where I go I won't be crying, I die

And you've got ways to make me do what you want.

I've got to stay away.

I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,
And it's you pretty baby,
I've just got to stay away from.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad that we parted.

I found myself a new romance.
Then you call that same old night,
Always change my mind.

Oh no, not again.

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again.
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.
Now I'm hung up on your love again.

Just as I was doing good,
You come back, just to prove you could.
Things will always be the same,
With me the victim of the game.

I'm doing fine.

I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.

Gonna miss the air you breathe.

Randy Brecker,"[Chorus:]
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

Randy Brecker,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.

No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.",By Myself,1999

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Must I pay back for all others
Till the day that you discover 
I was not the one?

When all cause for time is gone

And bring your vision on

And even words within this song
Are meaningless when taken wrong

May ne'er hear what I say

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots,1966

Make me an alibi, I'd swear you saw me.
Until the sun came up, it's true you knew me,
But when our time was up, you looked right through me.

That's what I am,

The way I seem to pass you undetected,
The way you make me feel from your perspective,

Randy Crawford,"Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me, what do I see?

Unhappy faces behind a painted smile
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style
Unhappy people livin' in sin and shame
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game

We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me, what do I see?

Young girls, who'll soon become
Streetwalkers in the night
Young boys, the restless breed
Looking for a fight

Children both rich and poor
They're searching for the truth
And if they don't find it
God help tomorrows youth, oh yes

We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me
While all around me, what do I see?

Hatred and jealousy
Brotherhood is dying
Love is the answer
But nobody's buying

Good people turnin' bad
Some don't but they are few
The winds are blowing
The choice is all up to you

We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yes, we're caught up in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time
We are ridin' on the trade winds

I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby

I don't believe it (Feeling)
I don't think that's true (Tied down)
It'll just pass if we allow it to (Need to break free)
It's just a stage we're going through (They say clean cuts)
I think you're just restless for something new (Heal much faster)

Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return
Is a piece of each other's time

Are we just taxi dancing
Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing
Has finally stopped playing our favorite song

Are we just taxi dancing
You're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation

Don't know if you're right
Don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long

Don't make it hard (I won't)
Don't make it easy (Hold you)
We'll just walk away (If you)
At the end of the song (Must go)

Give that love we once felt
Just one final spin around

The reasons now are clear
Still it seems strange somehow to fall in love
Only to find that love is not enough

Like a cigarette in the rain
A single drop would stop the flame
We were lovers, but we were never friends
I should known that it won't end
When the first dawn came
Like a cigarette in the rain

What a cruel twist of fate
To watch our love turn to hate
All of the arguments, the needless fights
Nothing in common, but our sleepless nights

Like a cigarette in the rain
A single drop would stop the flame
We were lovers, but we were never friends
I should known that it won't end

'Cause the love we have we shouldn’t let go

It’s clear to see
Your heart belongs to me
I’ll always get by
With you in my life
Don’t you ever leave

Our love is like
A merry go round
Sometimes it’s up
Sometimes it’s down

Like the sun and the rain
Even good loves found the change
Boy, you should know
'Cause the love we have we shouldn’t let go

What came before, wouldn't have grown
Maybe the past, has brought me to this
Maybe this time, love will be missed
I hear my heart calling for you
And I believe you feel it too

I want something permanent, like the stars in the sky

Permanent, like a burning flame
Permanent, I'll say it again
I want something that won't change

Respecting yourself, reaching down deep
That's how I'll find, a love so complete

I want something that will never change

What's my only way, I could never say that I don't feel the same
You've brought me somewhere I can feel safe
Don't you feel it, don't you feel it

Like the brightest moon
You take away the shadows from my night
Like the sweetest tune
You take the blue and turn it into white

As sure as every wave that breaks
I'll follow every move you make
I do, I do

Cause your light shines so bright
I see it glow though your skin
Your love is the sweetest thing
I'm so high tonight
Like I'm floating on air
I can feel you everywhere

Your loves the sweetest thing
Loves the sweetest thing

Like the perfect kiss
Leaves you breathless when two hearts make one
And with your heavenly caress
You let me know the best is yet to come

I hang on to every word you say
Cause no one else makes me feel the way 
You do, you do

Cause your light 
Shines so bright

Playing the piano
I hope ya like what I do
It's for you, and I'll try and sing right too

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference

And as I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, somebody's broken heart
In one man soul
And they follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got no place to go
That's why I want you to know

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
Change
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah, oh no

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines

The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious

To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

So diff'rent now from what it seemed

The good times that made us laugh, outweighed the bad.
I thought we'd get to see forever, but forever has blown away.
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.

All I know is where we've been and what we've been through.
If it gets me to tomorrow, I hope it's worth all the pain.

Randy Hardison,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

And I watch old Joe at the end of the bar with another hot woman 
On his one good arm and they walk out for a while and he
Comes back in smilin', again
So I finally had to ask old Joe, 
""Man, what's your secret to success, your power of Persuasion
Over the opposite sex""
And he says, ""Son, well, honestly, it's pretty simple."" 
He said, ""I just kinda walk up and buy her

Right up and smile and look her dead in the eye
And lie

It
Was like strike 1, strike 2, strike out again

Rest of your life
I've been waiting such a long, long time

And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do
We could hit the county line, hell we do that all the time

Instead of waiting like we usually to do

Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here

I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell 'em we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to

Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away

Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild, like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on, like a cowboy

I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that

He made it 40 miles out of town

That can move you when you hear it

Knew what her future held, like the back of his hand

Randy Howard,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

Randy Howard,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

Then my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Lookin' in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior

But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner

But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature

Baja al lowear, que esto es para muro salta el blowear 
Mi satélite de bitch, chequieando la para bitch 
Que esta noche yo ando como perro suelto sin list 

Fly Montana, Tony sin perico con el money 
Loco por pegarte a la pared para darte como pony 
Esto es un perreo del sucio, el que se ponga luci 
Va a sentir los rapagas rafagasos de la usy 

Del calvo, tápense que queden a salvo 
Saben lo que puede pasar broth 
Tengo las mujeres más ricas, el caso se te fabrica 
Pégate para la pared en lo que te ubicas y sigue dándole 

Tu, matame, matame, arrastrame 
Pa la pared pa la pared pa la pared 
Tu, matame, matame, arrastrame 
Pa la pared pa la pared pa la pared 

Y yo, matame con tu perreo y tu sandungueo 
Veo malas intensiones en tus ojos verdes y feo 
Que tu quieres llevarme pero lejos de la pista 
Para un lugar donde no haya vista 

En lo oscuro bien pegado 
Un movimiento exagerado, demasiado 
Échate el panty para el lado 
No inventes mami que nos fuimos contra la pared eh! 

Pa la pared pa la pared pa la pared! 

Este papichiche después de un perreo rudo 
Te lo vas a vacilar te lo aseguro, que te voy a dar duro 
Llévame y secuestrarme de aquí, llévame para allá

De la manera en que te mueves tu para mi 
En tus ojos lo que veo es fuego 
No sigas tocándome y vamos a matarnos 

Manos a la pared y lo que hables en tu contra 
No te hagas la tonta que te montas 
Estas obligada a romper todo el terreno 
Estas abrigada para que yo coja el sereno 

Entonces, enséñame tu y saca la loba 
Llévame, pa la pared pa la pared

Randy Kerber,"How can you blame me for
The way I never felt before and
All the mistakes that I made
It's just that I was so in love
I couldn't keep you close enough
I held too tight to the reins

Love's not a thing that you own
Oh I
I guess it wasn't mine
I didn't mean to lose the love
It took so long to find

That burns in my soul
But you never notice the pain 
Love is an anchor

And I wonder why
We hold on with tears in our eyes
And I wonder why

Things right
And I wonder why 
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Yeah, I wonder why

I'm no angel
With my selfish pride
But I love you more every day
Love is an anger
That builds up inside
As the tears of frustration
Roll down my face
Why does love always have to turn
Out this way

Well, there's never been a moment
Since the day you walked out
That I haven't felt
The pain of losing you

Washed his face and hands

He said, ""Girl, I'm not a Negro I'm a millionaire
As you can plainly see
So many women love my money
But you have proved that you love only me.

And you won't have to dance no more

And kicked me out of the Navy,
They would have strung me up if they could.

Through the early mornin' fog
Over the meadow and past the bog,
They were runnin'

The rabbit had jumped a fence or two
Cause that's what rabbits like to do
Big black dog had to jump 'em too
They was runnin'

Now this black dog had a brother
'Cept he was white as snow
One looked like the other
Least that's how the story go

So the black dog's chasin' the rabbit down the road
And he seen a familiar face he knowed
He said, ""Hey there white dog, what you say?
Take over chasin' this rabbit, all right?
Thank you, get away!
Take over chasin' this rabbit
Or they'll be no rabbit stew today for us.""

And here what the white dog say
He say, ""That rabbit smiled as he went by
He know he got you beat, that's why.
You wait here and I'll chase a while
Cause I hate to see a rabbit smile.""
So off he go, off the white dog go.

Now when that little rabbit looked around
He jumped four feet off the ground
He said, ""That big old dog that's chasin' me
Why, he's taken off his jacket and he's runnin' free
He's taken off his jacket and he's catchin' me.""

Should get out of the rabbit racket.

I said, ""Work?  What are you talking about?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?""
He said ""Yes I am!""
And drove off into the morning light

For a while I stood there, on the sidewalk
A Roy Rogers lunch pail in my hand
Then I heard sweet children's voices calling
And I began to understand
They said, ""Four eyes!  Look like you're still sleeping!""

And I put my arm  put my arm around his little shoulder

If I had one wish
One dream I knew would come true
I'd want to speak to all the people of the world
I'd get up there, I'd get up there on that platform
First I'd sing a song or two you know I would
Then I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd talk to the people and I'd say
""It's a rough rough world, it's a tough tough world
Well, you know
And things don't always, things don't always go the way we plan
But there's one thing, one thing we all have in common

In any fair system they would flourish and thrive

They eke out a living and they barely survive

When I was a young boy, maybe thirteen
I took a hard look around me and asked what does it mean?

And I talked to everybody that I knew

I was washing his car with a friend of mine
He was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuit
I said ""You look kind of funny""
He said ""I know that I do""

""But I got a great big house on the hill here

We used to live on Willow near the Garden District
Next to the Sugar Bowl
Momma used to wheel me past an ice cream wagon
One side for White and one side for Colored
I remember trash cans floatin' down Canal Street
It rained every day one summer
Momma used to take me to Audubon Park
Show me the ways of the world
She said  ""here comes a white boy  there goes a black one, that one's an octoroon
This little cookie here's a macaroon, that big round thing's a red balloon
And the paper down here's called the Picayune
And here's a New Orleans tune""

In 1948 my Daddy came to the city
Told the people that they'd won the war
Maybe they'd heard it, maybe not
Probably they'd heard it and just forgot
Cause they built him a platform there in Jackson Square
And the people came to hear him from everywhere
They started to party and they partied some more
Cause New Orleans had won the war
(We knew we'd do it, we done whipped the Yankees)

Daddy said, ""I'm gonna get this boy out of this place
Bound to sap his strength
People have fun here, and I think that they should
But nobody from here every come to no good
They're gonna pickle him in brandy and tell him he's saved
Then throw fireworks all 'round his grave""

To spare the world the fearsome Hun
As through the years, the fight we'd led
Too long, we stood alone, too long alone

And when at last, battle's won
We asked for no reward and no reward was received

Two generations turned to blood and dust
Only the best were lost
Only the best

And now, the years have passed
The times have changed
The foe is risen up
He stands
Astride the world
His dreams of conquest all fulfilled

It's their lips that give them away
You know, so soft, so pink, my hero, my little hero

I believe that in the sky there shines a star for me
Clean and bright and shining like the sun shines
And when it seemed that life was hard
Impossible to find your way
I thought about my star and kept on

Listen to your heart, it will tell you everything
Follow it wherever it would go

As dull as a butter knife
Oh, Northern boy, clean of limb, clear of eye
Unfettered he lives, unfettered he'll die

Saskatchewan an endless prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Only a man, half blind on whiskey
Would choose to make this land his home
Would choose to make this land his home

As quick as a thunderbolt to adventure he'll rise

And just like a sheep he will follow you

Relax, enjoy yourself
You know it's only a glorious game
They've fruit trees growin' in an open field
And wild roses bloomin' down a country lane
Look around, old chum
Slow it down, old chum
Or you never will succeed
You never will succeed

[The Devil is still pretty unhappy]

Relax, enjoy yourself
It's all such a wonderful game
There are rivers and forests,
And mountains high
There are deep green oceans
And the pale blue sky

Let it go and then, you will know, old friend
That you never will succeed
You never will succeed

Chinese Angel Child (to the Devil):
It must be very trying to be bad all the time
Vicious and cruel and mean
[you get used to it]
When there's so much beauty
All round us to be seen
And so very little time in which to see it all
And feel it all
So little time
[you should know]
Perhaps when you were little
No one held you in their arms
And told you that they loved you very much
Perhaps you were embittered
By your fall from Grace

Devil: How long have you been dead?

Angel Child: Two Months

D: Do you miss your friends?

AC: Yes, I miss them
I've tried to make friends here, but it's hard

Do you wish that you were with them?

I do miss them

D: The man who shot you in the head
In that Burger King in Tucson
Well, he never will be punished you know
He will move to Big Pine, California
Become the richest man in Mono County
While that may not be much, it's enough
When he dies
Sixty-five years from today
With his loved ones all around him
He'll be whisked right up to heaven
He won't pass go or have to wait
He'll just march right through the God-damned gate

Sometimes even to myself
My ways are mysterious
