Anika Moa,"(Ah?)

Constant rush
Opens silence
Heavy words
Thrash my guts, no no no no no

Were my plans way too soon
Was my direction all a waste
Should I jump at the sound
Was it not challenging enough

What about solution (my son)
What about pride (my son)
Filled you up too much with my heart (you know it?s over)
Where are the patients (my son)
Where are the pills, my son
Where are the people you know, my son

Static notes
Under protection
Worried bells
Ring to save themselves, no no no no

Am I losing control
Was my argument way too sad
Do you laugh at my weight
Are you scared of the end results

What about solution (my son)
What about pride (my son)
Filled you up too much with my heart (you know it?s over)
Where are the patients (my son)
Where are the pills, my son
Where are the people you know
Where are the people you know

I've been too soft with you so far
I've cried too much over you
Where is my son
Ho.. hy.. yeah..

What about religion (my son)
What about faith (my son)
Filled you up too much with my heart (you know it?s over)
Where are the patients (my son)
Where are the pills, my son
Where are the people you know, it?s over
Where are the people you know
Where are the people

Where are the people you know, whoa
Where are the people you know",My Son,2002
Anika Moa,"I am just a school girl
Living in a fantasy world 
Now I'm outspoken
I walked around for a couple of years
Trying to convince myself
It was a plan I was to understand it

They say things to me like you're so beautiful
They spoke of other things like 
how much do you charge
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

Silence stalks me pushes me through
I feel so broken
Turn the lights on a couple of times to see if you would exchange
I would not know if you turned them off

They said things to me like you're so wonderful
You spoke of other things like I love you 'cause
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

Maybe I'm allowed maybe it's in the book
Maybe I could shout down the walls
9 till 5 I hope it doesn't show 
9 till 5 it's not a perfect thing

They said things to me like you're amazing
You speak of other things like is this going on my bill
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

You're Youthful
You know this time will not do
You're so youthful I own you now

Oh

Youthful yeah",Youthful,2002
Anika Moa,"Could there be a time when we could be friends...
I know that I'm over you
I know it's a risk by leaving your side
It's a feeling my heart can't undo
I don't wanna be as lonely as I feel
But maybe I'm here cos you left me high and dry
The woman who has no heart is me

And I'm standing in this fire
The flames are rising high
Could you ever forgive me
I never meant to break your heart
And you never meant to break mine

I was so nervous of waking up alone
But does it mean I'm stronger now?
Life is a lie and honesty is meaningless
Cos you know that I honestly tried
I don't wanna be as angry as you are
Maybe I'm here cos I punished you for so long
The woman who has no heart is me

And I'm standing in this fire
The flames are rising high
Could you ever forgive me
I never meant to break your heart
And you never meant to break mine

Make this harder say I'm crazy
But please don't be mean to me cos I really tried
Could you ever forgive me
But I never meant to break your heart
And you never meant to break mine",Standing in This Fire,2007
Anika Moa,"When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I look around me
And feel you are ever so close to me
Each tear that flows from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You were all, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me
When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by
Until finally my time descends on me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me",Go to Sleep,2013

It's about truth, it's about lies that you just can't hide

It's about black, it's about white

I guess I'm gonna head out west
Trade my old collection of records and things
Get a new car, get a new guy
Get a new lease on life

In this place of love, and suitcase of night, and my broken pride

When I was young my parents yelled

I’m older those words are still pure 
not the look of a crook in his books what’s he taking from you?

Animaniacs,"Miss flameil:Yakko,
Yakko:yea miss Flameil?
Miss Flameil:I want you to multiply...47 times...83


7 times 3 is 21 which as you know is just two 10's plus 1 
And so we put the one right here and we carry the 2 one left
To the top of the tenths place right next door
And we put it on top of the number 4
Which is really four tenths that we multiply times 3 in the ones place
And that's why
We now have 12 which we add to the 2 that we carry to get 14

See how easy that was
Ho ho it's multiplication
Yes math education
Hey Albert Einstein said that it's so easy to do
It's simple it's breezy
It's fun and it's easy
So buy a calculator
You can multiply too

And now the second digit!
7 times 8 is 56 which as you know is just 5 tens plus 6
And so we put the 6 in the tenths place, left of the one
Carry the 5 like we did before
To the top of the tenths place next to the 4
Then multiply that 4 times 8 to get 32 see isn't this great
Then we add the 5 that we carried before to get 37
Then add once more, straight down to get 3901

Isn't this swell
Oh lets give multiplication
A standing innovation
Issac Newton multiplied a couple times two
Times, two, times two
It's simple it's breezy

I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you I love you, that you're forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time

[Chorus:]
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day

I never questioned my feelings before
I felt but I felt there was it, nothin' more
But I can't keep denying the truth in my heart
Ooo, the touching and talking but we're oceans apart

[Chorus]

I've been spending my life
Thinking you're the one
Now I'm holding my lies
And the damage was done

If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say

I've been calling it love
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay

Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love...
I've been calling it love...",Calling It Love,1998
Animotion,"I know it seems like I'm a million miles away
At times you feel like you don't even know me
But in this world the pressure's building everyday
And I need time to work things out - oh baby

It's not that I don't love you - oh no
It's just that I - I've got to have

Room to move - that's all I need
That's all I ask for - room to breathe
Room to move - that's all I need
That's all I ask for - give it to me
Room to move - everybody needs - room to move

Everybody needs some freedom to survive
To shake the chains of responsability
And you can help me make this feeling come alive
'Cause when you hold me close - that's when you set me free

Girl you know I'll always love you - oh yeah
'Cause when we touch - I get so much

You lose your mind - if you don't take time
You cross that line and your mind explodes
You push too hard - and your feelings starve
Emotions are - all destroyed
Girl you know I'll always love you - oh yeah
'Cause when we touch - I get so much",Room to Move,1998
Animotion,"You are an obsession
I cannot sleep
I am your possession
Unopened at your feet
There's no balance
No equality
Be still I will not accept defeat

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession
You're my obsession

To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession

To make you sleep with me

I feed you I drink you
My day and my night
I need you I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest
You want to leave
Stay
Oh, there's no alternative

Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger beware
A circumstance
In your naked dreams
Your affection is not what it seems

You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me

My fantasy has turned to madness
And all my goodness
Has turned to badness
My need to possess you
Has consumed my soul
My life is trembling
I have no control

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession

Es ist mein Geld, was mich täglich über Wasser hält

Schieße mit der 9 Millimeter
Mein Kontostand gibt mir grünes Licht
Fahre jetzt den BMW gemütlich

Genau deswegen weiß ich, wie ich an mein Geld komm
Ich nehm nach Düsseldorf die Abfahrt

Rapper machen mir auf Cassius Clay, aber ziehen Pfefferspray
Du und ich ist so wie Wrestlemania gegen MMA
Da, wo ich herkomm', wird zu viel geredet zu deinem Begräbnis
Hör auf zu labern und mach dich gerade, dann wird das erledigt, Pussy
Deutscher Rap - ein Haufen voller Jammerlappen hinter einer Tastatur im Internet - willkommen in der Realität!
Wo die Banger sich nicht hinter einem Monitor verstecken können, sondern man sie sieht und dann schlägt
Vollbart wie ein Wolfsmensch, Hände wie ein Schaufelradbagger
Steige direkt aus dem A8er, laufe ein und danach gibt's ein Massaker
Denn ich bin der Falsche für Scherze
Egal, wie du rumschreist, ich riech' deine Fotze schon auf eine Meile entfernt, eh
Ein Blick in die Augen von mir und die Köter bemerken, die Scheiße wird ernst
Denn ich ging durch tausend deiner Sorte auf meiner Reise hierher, geh und sag deinem Herr:
Guck, ich scheiß' auf einen Handschuh, auf 'nen Mundschutz oder 'nen Ringrichter
Dieses Beast erkämpft im Zwinger, Zinker kriegen den Fickfinger
Sag jedem der Hunde: hier draußen im Dschungel regiert man allein mit der Faust
Eisen schärft Eisen und all eure Plastikmusik endet in diesem Feuer als Rauch, Pussy

Würden gern Ganove sein, dabei sind sie vogelfrei
Meine Antwort ist nur eine Frage der Zeit
Denn nur ein Baum, der gefällt wird, macht Krach, aber der Wald, der am wachsen ist, schweigt, Pussy
Keiner dieser Welle-Macher würde mir alleine in die Fresse sagen, was sie dauernd schreiben
Denn sie wüssten alle: diese Unterhaltung endet für sie alle auf der Intensiv ohne Lebenszeichen
Denn ich würde dann jeden zerfleischen
Kohle und teure Klamotten sind nett anzusehen, aber werden im Ernstfall nicht reichen, wenn ich sie seh' und dann alle zerreiße
Brenn' wie ein Maserati oder Kawasaki auf dem Massaker-Beat von dem Dadash Ari
Messerscharf, so wie Calamari in Wasabi, mach auf Abi und es gibt ein' Uppercut wie Badr Hari
Sie kamen einfach auf meine Partie und machten da Stress ohne Grund
Und gingen dann wieder nach Hause mit 'ner gebrochenen Nase und Schwanz in ihr'm Mund
Sag den Fotzen: scheiß auf Handys, ich hab' immer schlechte Verbindung
Doch ich kenn' 'ne gute Erfindung, nur vier Fäuste sind die Bedingung
Geh, sag diesen Hyänen: ich hab' keine Nerven für Internet-Rambos und Tweef
Jeder kann Scheiße erzählen, doch glaub mir, 'ne Faust mitten auf deine Nase lügt nie, Pussy

Stell dir vor, du wirst gefeiert wie ein Held 
Und die ganze Welt liegt dir zu Füßen
Aber damit dieser Schein immer hält, musst du jeden anderen betrügen und lügen
Alle anderen im Leben immer schlechtreden
Nur um alle deine Ziele zu erreichen
Den Starken stets aus dem Weg gehen, du zielst es ab auf die Schwachen, die schweigen
Oder baust ehrlich was auf und andere lachen dich immer nur aus
Die Wahrheit, die du ihn’ von Herzen erzählst, stößt nur auf Hass, aber nicht auf Applaus
Der eine fährt Ferrari durch das Koks oder Haze
Baut seinen Eltern so Paläste aus Gold
Seine Mutter weiß von nichts, also strahlt sie voller Tränen
Denn ihr Sohnemann macht sie so unfassbar stolz
Der andere schuftet von morgens bis nachts
Für acht Euro Lohn für die Miete und Strom
Die Eltern werden alt und verkümmern dahin ohne Hilfe von ihrem ältesten Sohn
Wir alle sind bloß gefangen in zwei Welten, Mama, das Paradies liegt unter deinem Fuß
Doch über meinem Kopf seh’ ich nichts als die Hölle, darum muss ich wählen zwischen Ehre oder Ruhm

La réussite, mais à quel prix?
Faut-il trahir, pactiser avec le diable pour réussir?

Arm an Geld, dafür reich an Prinzipien
Dein Gold wiegt so wie eine Tonne, doch Stolz im Herzen kannst du nicht wiegen
Dadash, glaub mir, dieses Leben ist für jeden wie ein Teufelskreis
Darum bin ich viel lieber heut allein
Kann kein Heuchler sein, der bei Leuten schleimt
Denn ein Freund von jedem ist der Freund von keinem
Mach’ die Musik, auch wenn niemand dran glaubt
Denn was Gott für uns schreibt, radiert niemand hier aus
Sie könn’ alle Blumen der Erde verbrennen
Aber den Frühling hält niemand je auf
Manche machen alles nur für den Erfolg
Doch merken dann am Ende das ist es nicht wert
Denn Erfolg ist wie Salzwasser aus dem Meer 
Mit jedem Schluck hast du Durst nach mehr
Manche verlieren ihre Identität
Verkaufen Familie für bisschen Fame
Denn es ist viel leichter, die Scheine zu zählen
Als voller Stolz in den Spiegel zu sehen
Wir alle sind Seelen gefangen in zwei Welten
Mama, das Paradies liegt unter deinem Fuß
Doch über meinem Kopf seh’ ich nichts als die Hölle
Darum muss ich wählen zwischen Ehre oder Ruhm

Aber stehen wir vor Gott, besitzen wir nur all die Taten unserer Lebzeit
All die Lügen verlieren ihre Kraft, all die Schätze verlieren ihren Wert

Keiner kauft sich frei aus seiner Schuld, kein Anwalt, der Zeugen besticht

Rechtfertigen müssen wir uns alle für die Dinge, die wir heute tun

In meinem Viertel werden Nazis direkt attackiert
Aus den Beamern hörst du laut: „Wir als Kanaken hier!“

Denn ihr Magen knurrt leer wie ein Leopard
Eh, Mentalität, drei Affen
Nichts hören, sagen oder sehen wie im Schatten
Fick auf Ratten durch diesen Lebensstil
Die einen schreiben Geschichte, andere erzählen sie
Jeder gibt ’nen Fick auf die Gesetzeshüter
Denn sie hetzten und verletzen Brüder
Stellt euch vors Asylheim und schlagt den Rechten den Schädel ein
Denn trotz deutschem Pass bleib’ ich Flüchtling auf Lebenszeit
Ich lernte oft zu schweigen und zu schauen
Denn sie sprechen mit den Fäusten, lügen mit den Augen
Flüstern mit den Händen, die meisten können es nicht verstehen
Weil wir keine Bücher, sondern Gesichter lesen

Trotz der täglichen Schläge, halte immer deine Deckung hoch, Bruder
Denn es geht voran
Deine Gebete sind stärker als all ihre Gewehre, denk stets dran
Es geht voran
Bullen knebeln hier jeden, klopf von den Reebok und renn
Denn es geht voran
Hürden bedeuten, es geht voran, es geht voran
Es geht voran!

Und wir erzählen von Geschichten, die auf der Straße geschrieben werden
Lächelnde Gesichter, doch tragen die Narben tief im Herzen
Das Leben ist nicht fair und hinterlässt viele Scherben
Doch bevor sie knien müssen, würden sie lieber sterben
So macht jeder, was er tun muss, in den harten Zeiten
Sünden über Sünden, doch wir beten, um stark zu bleiben
Vor dem Gesetz alles abzustreiten
Von illegal zu legal und es allen zeigen
Es ist ’n Teufelskreis ohne Aussicht
Und keiner kann uns bremsen, wenn die Wut in uns ausbricht
Weil dieser Hass uns im Innern auffrisst
Es gibt nicht zu bereden und ab jetzt: die Faust spricht
Ich könnte aufgeben, doch ich denk’ nicht dran
Ich hab’ die Mittelfinger oben, seitdem ich denken kann
Ein Funken reicht für ein’ Flächenbrand
Denn eure Ungerechtigkeit macht hier Menschen krank

Bin jeder Vater ausm Kriegsgebet
Der seine Kinder zu Grab trägt wegen Soldaten
Wegen Öl, wegen Waffen
Während die Täter Milliarden scheffeln und ruhig schlafen
Ich bin jeder aus der zweiten, dritten Generation
Noch immer bei Bewerbungen abgelehnt
Nur die Straße hat es auf uns abgesehen
In die Zelle kommen acht von zehn
Bullen prügeln auf uns ein, bis wir Blut pissen
Richter wollen ein Exempel statuieren
Anwalt sagt, „Rasier besser deinen Bart vor Gericht ab
Färb die Haare blond, denn sonst wirst du verlieren!“
Haben's satt, unsre Familien nur per Skype zu sehen
Manche sterben und du schaffst es nicht, ihnen beizustehen
Satellitenschüsseln sagen, wir haben Heimweh
Nur ein weitere Stein auf dem Leidensweg
Eure Bomben haben meine Heimat zerlegt
Darum bin ich einer von denen, die's nie schaffen, ihre Heimat zu sehen

Blutrache, wo ich lebe, zeigt sich keiner hier an
Väter beißen weinend auf die Hand

Geld war nie viel da, nur die Liebe, doch ich peilte
Geld brauch' ich keins, denn die Liebe, sie reichte

So hasste ich die Scheine, doch wusste ab jetzt
Dass die Freiheit einen Preis hat, der nur mit ihnen schmeckt

Was würde der Junge, der du warst

Ah, von der kleinen Prinzessin zu 'nem Klassenschwarm
Plötzlich kam die Pubertät und du wurdest rassiger
Titten wurden massiger, Gesicht wurde plastischer
Du hast viele männliche Kumpels, der Klassiker
Klug und versaut, fickt sofort mit ihnen
Aus der Schulballprinzessin wurd' 'ne Blowjobqueen
Die Bestätigung dein Hunger, keine Liebe in der Seele
Tausend Typen in dei'm Instagram, viele sind vergeben
Du möchtest, dass sie fremdgehen, denn nur so kapieren sie
Was du meinst, wenn du sagst, dass Liebe nicht existiert
Doch da ist ein Junge, den du magst, er ist nett
Groß, stark, liebst all die Texte, die er rappt
Vielleicht behandelt er dich ja mit Respekt und nicht wie Dreck
Doch er kommt rein, fickt dich und wirft dich einfach weg und geht
„Mein Leben für deins“ auf Repeat
Du gehst verheult ins das Bad, schaust in den Spiegel und fragst dich

Was würde das Mädchen, das du warst
Sagen zu der Frau, die du bist?
Was würde das Mädchen, das du warst
Sagen zu der Frau, die du bist?
Was würde das Mädchen, das du warst

Was würde das Mädchen, das du warst

Als du klein warst, warst du noch politisch
Wolltest was verändern, deine Interpreten kritisch
Man konnte dich zitieren, ohne sich dafür zu schämen
Denn du warst das Mittel, etwas lyrisch zu bewegen
Über Tabula Rasa, von Kabul bis Gaza
Entwickeltest dich mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit wie die NASA
Doch kaum gab es Para, Macht und die Frauen
Hast du dich verändert und wurdest zu 'nem Clown
Heute läufst du da, wo Schlampen in 'nem Club blasen
Wirst zum Soundtrack für Kanaks, die oft zuschlagen
Deine Texte immer dümmer, denn so kommst du an die Masse
Doch was du nicht merkst, du verlierst dabei an Klasse
Generation Deutschrap, Generation Toydreck
Generation Heucheln für Ketten, Batzen, Bräute
Ich weiß, dass dein wahrer Kern nicht ausgestorben ist
Doch mach das Radio an und hör, was aus die geworden ist und frag dich

Was würde die Musik, die du warst
Sagen zu dem Dreck, der du bist?
Was würde die Musik, die du warst

Zwei Schüsse in die Luft
Jede meiner Narben hat 'ne eigene Geschichte (is so)
Ein Pfeil steckt tief in der Brust
Doch ich breche ihn ab, denn nur Gott kann mich richten
Bin gewachsen im Block
Wo jeder zweite verzweifelt, verloren und am Boden war
Doch ich kämpfte mich durch
Und ich rappte von Freiheit schon lange, bevor das hier Mode war
Zwei Schüsse in die Luft für die Birras
Rot-Gelb-Grün tätowiert, -wiert
Aufgeben sieht man uns hier niemals
Ganz egal, was auch passiert, -siert (is so)
Glaubt mir, ich hatte nie viel
Schlief in 'nem Auto, kein Dach überm Kopf, aber immer ein Ziel
Denn ich wusste, ich werde es schaffen, gab alles und zweifelte nie, niemals
Hater, danke vielmals
Heute schieben sie Hass
Denn mein Erfolg und das, was ich erreicht hab', brennt in ihren Wunden, so wie Salz
Und ich hoff', dass es weh tut
Gebe 'ne Lektion über Demut (is so)
Und ich fahr' diese Schiene seit Jahren und bleib' unaufhaltsam, genau wie ein D-Zug (is so)
Zwei Schüsse in die Luft für die Fam
Ihr seid mein Glück und mein Licht hier im Dunkeln
Gebe alles, für euch würde ich brennen
Ohne euch fehlt mir die Luft in den Lungen
Bin ein einfacher Mann, doch die Liebe, die ihr mir gegeben habt, macht mich zum König
Ich war nur Asche, doch all diese Lieder hier machten mich zu einem Phönix

Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark
Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark
We never give it up, ever live it up
Never give it up, until we reach up the top
Never left from your side, I never push, I knock
Never live a dirty lifestyle and flop
Never give it up, ever live it up
Never give it up, until we reach up the top
Never left from your side, I never push, I knock
Never live a dirty lifestyle and flop

Ah, zwei Schüsse in die Luft für die Brüder im Bau
Spuck' auf die Gesetze, leben, wie ich will, dadash
Luftküsse für die Mütter da draußen
Wegen uns weinen sie jede Nacht ganz still, dadash
Alles, was ich kann, hab' ich mir beigebracht
Entweder wirst du hier ein Bonze in nur einer Nacht
Oder kommst in Einzelhaft, nur Allah kennt meinen Kniefall
Alle andern wissen, ich kenn' keine Angst
Bin, bleib', war besser
Verteile Headshots, von mir aus trag Kevlar
Der allerletzte Jäger zwischen Aasfressern
Rasier' meinen nackten Schädel mit dem Jagdmesser
Stehe zwischen Tausenden gerade, sag mir, welcher dieser Rapper will mich draußen noch testen
Seit ich klein bin ist A King und so wurde ich zum Schlagring für die Faust des Nordwestens
Manche Idole von mir wurden mit der Zeit zu meinen Gegnern
Andere wurden zu Brüdern, andere wurden zu Hatern
Jeder ist hier nur auf seinem Film, so wie Tesa
Mach auf G, man zieht dich übern Tisch, so wie Zewa
Darum macht mir bitte alle nicht einen auf Lehrer
Oder du verlierst hier sicher dein Gesicht wie bei Lepra
Wir sind verschieden, wo du herkommst, schlafen Kids vor Boutiquen, nur wegen Yeezys
Wo ich herkomm', schlafen Kriegskinder vor Ruinen, nur wegen ISIS
Jede Line wie eine Sniper, denn ich ziele so präzise, jedes Wort geht ins Herz wie ein Volltreffer
Vielleicht werd' ich nie ein Goldrapper
Aber die Sprache der Straße hat einen Dolmetscher

Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark
Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark
We never give it up, ever live it up
Never give it up, until we reach up the top
Never left from your side, I never push, I knock
Never live a dirty lifestyle and flop
Never give it up, ever live it up
Never give it up, until we reach up the top
Never left from your side, I never push, I knock
Never live a dirty lifestyle and flop

The stars gave me the wings so I can fly
Can feel the wind beneath my feet and know I'm getting by
Reflections of victory in my eyes
Just like a shepard I make circles in the sky

Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark
Always from wi heart, always from wi heart
Always light a spark, always find a path
Always from wi heart, that's how we come outta the dark",Zwei Schüsse,2018

C'est un peu étrange savoir qu'on s'verra plus
Même si on s'croisait que de temps en temps
J't'appréciais sincèrement
Alors aux cuites qu'on s'prenait consciencieusement
À ton talent
À la toile que tu t'payes vu de là-haut maintenant
Une gorgée pour la mort qui nous chope au tournant
Il y a des moments qui balaient toute la merde de la vie
Des plaisirs simples qui nous apaisent de certains soucis
Des tracasseries du temps qui passent et nous vieillit
Polit nos crânes et parfois même nous assagit
Nous épanouit ou nous aigrit
Un peu trop cette fois-ci
On a des sentiments
Si étranges et si souvent des sentiments
De boum bye bye à la prochaine j'descends
Des sentiments
Pacifiques ou violents
Des sentiments
Bien étranges de temps en temps
Mais tant qu'on les a et les ressent
Ils nous maintiennent bien vivants
J'espère qu't'es mieux
Maintenant qu't'es high beubeu
T'étais un peu chelou
Un peu chéper surtout
Qu'est-ce qu'a pu te faire croire que ça valait plus le coup
L'avant veille on était fonfon
Ce jour-là on s'est croisé
J'étais speed j'allais taffer
Alors de loin je t'ai salué
J'crois bien qu'tu tapais un café
Mais je ne me serais douter
Qu'tu checkerais beetlejuice après
C'est Anthony qui me l'a annoncé :
""Sad news from the stars"", comme il disait

La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
On vit pour qui et pourquoi je m'demande ça parfois
Quand j'vois la lassitude peinte sur les faces autour de moi
On taffe pour qui déjà quand avant le quinze du mois
Y'a plus d'tune sur le compte en banque
Et qu'on n'sait pas si on finira sous un pont ou sous un toit
À l'hôtel ou dans une bouche de métro
Sous l'regard indifférent des pelos
À rester là juste parce qu'il fait chaud
De nos jours, par les temps qui courent de loin
J'préfère être aveugle que sourd
Je crois même qu'l'amour ne sauve pas d'la précarité
La vie reste belle mais le monde est sans pitié
La réalité nous brûle nous montre ses crocs acérés, laissant
Les plus largués sur le bas-côté
Refrain
Et la vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
Incompréhension, quiproquos,
On s'bat pour la même chose à différents niveaux
On perd sa vie à tenter de la gagner
Ou on perd la raison et on finit interné
Je vois le visage marqué des gens trop anxieux
Et la porte de la solitude derrière leurs yeux
Je n'prie pas pour eux, ai des doutes sur Dieu
Leur souhaite seulement que ça aille mieux
Je suis plus qu'hier et moins que demain, c'est clair
J'préfère me taire juste pour ne pas parler
Laisser s'installer le silence
Les jours passent comme les nuages et j'ignore presque tout
Sauf que les oiseaux là-haut rient de nous

Je donne ma langue au chat cousin
Bien que je sois chelou
Un peu vilain pas voyou
Même pas méchant pour deux sous
Tout juste innocent comme vous
Même si comme vous,
Parfois j'ai un peu de mal à aller jusqu'au bout
J'avoue, Johnny, plus d'une fois, j'avoue, j'ai pris mes jambes à mon coup

Ils ont pensé ça quand ils t'ont retrouvé
Les yeux ouverts, un sourire figé,
Dans ton lit, décédé?
J'ai eu l'plaisir de te côtoyer
À chaque fois, quand tu me dépannais
Je savais bien que tu me bananais
Et que tes dés étaient plombés
C'est étrange de parler de toi au passé
C'est comme ça puisque tu as trépassé
Je comprenais rien au portugais
Tu parlais lentement pour m'aider
Et tu avais l'air bien
Mais ça sentait le sapin
Dans ce caniveau sans lune
Dans ta Cadillac de fortune

Ooohhhhhhhh? Zé x 
Les hommes blessés sont dangereux
Moins pour les autres que pour eux
Il te manquait que l'argent pour être honnête
T'aimais pas que Rosa te prenne la tête
Avec tes dents du devant fêlées
T'avais du style quand tu souriais
T'étais jamais vraiment pressé
Je ne t'ai jamais vu sans ton bonnet
Fini les pauses spliff Rua Da Silva
Les dominos au café de Samba
Les après-midi à chiller
Le train fantôme est passé
Ce grand jour curieusement a débuté
Par un matin ordinaire
Dans ce caniveau sans lune
Dans ta Cadillac de fortune

Je veux une femme douce à aimer

Élégante à souhait
Tâches de douceur, graines de beauté
Parsemée sur ton corps de pécheresse
L'oiseau rare de mes rêves
La belle diablesse
Tu as toute ma confiance et j'attends tes sentences
Doctoresse avec tes mots
J'aime la saveur de ta peau

J'aime ta danse dans les airs sans filet
Mille envies, tes façons de m'enfiévrer 
Je suis ces quelques ronds de fumée 
Qui s'échouent sur tes dessous parfumés
Tâches de douceur, graines de beauté
Voici d'authentiques hypothétiques baisers

J’suis pas de ces mioches qu’on été voir Bambi au cinoche
Une vie violente, tu peux te manger une barre de fer dans le crâne
Comme taper des barres de rire au ventre
Trop macho pour avoir une femme gouvernante
Une chance sur deux d'avoir des billets recouvert d'encre

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

Je rigole frère pour oublier que des truc me surine l'âme
Que pour des histoires de terrain y’a des grosses fusillades
Qu’une p’tite balle peut suffir à coucher un rugbyman
Qu’on reconnaîtra du meurtrier que son blouzon Furigan
Papapa! Batard!
Que mon pote et sa malette reviendront pas du Surinam
Que face au mal-être, se taper des barres est notre unique arme
Dur de se dire qu’on reverra plus Hicham
À cause d’un casque de becanne
Il est monté sur sa moto avec la classe de Beckham
Aujourd’hui le lieu du drame est recouvert de liasses de pétales

I want my freedom full freedom full freedom mmm hmmm

Verse 1 

As I look in the mirror I see the picture gettin' clearer 
On the rip of this straightest of the life that I live 
But uh I see em comin' before they approach 
Just like a stafty slot until you circle with hope 
I maintaining on your legendary dreams and stack 
Making million dollar moves with many platinum plaques 
Negotiate your freedom, you catchin' CRP 

From the court from blue, come many nights no sleep 
What's the scenario of life when you trapped in crime 
My 'lil homie still incarcerated for packing a nine 
Now history repeat itself, there's black on black 
Check my background, there's evidence just hide it's back 
Eliminate all my foes, we run violent thrusts 
Excuse me for my crime but in God I trust 
Bossalinie unaffected by the eyes of even 
Cause I'm military minded and demand my freedom 

(Chorus) 
Verse 2 
Record labels try to sign for many years in fact 
Want a life time commitment, get you hooked like crack 
Independent, black owned, you can keep your deal 
I remain with No Limit cause the tank be real 
I lose my cousin eight years for the time he spent 
The penitentiary is full of black violent, meant 
Try to make a change, they can't 
Cause they cuffs to tight 

Momma please help us cause my mind ain't right 
It ain't easy being me with my skin so toned 
The mother land ain't been the same since they took me from home 
My mobile phone in the benz, gettin' high with my friends 
Rainy days got us fighting each other, digging our graves 
A cell block full of pictures, can't wait for parole 
I need a second change of life cause I'm getting to old 
And it's cold I can't see, can't sleep at night 
Like a rebel for my freedom, I'll be prepared to fight

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"")",2003

A feeling I can't explain
The love I lost I found again
My broken heart you came to mend
But it still seems as though we are miles and miles apart

The very best is all I got
It's all I got to give
My soul was lost in darkness
But you arrived to see me through
And you came to me all by surprise
Then I moved the dark ness right out of my eyes
And it's plain to see
That you were all I need
And I want to know

[Chorus:]
Will you be mine?
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine

This kind of love only comes around
Only once in a lifetime
But the last love I tried to hold
It left me feelin' so empty and blue
And it made me afraid to let my true feelings show

I need you here right by my side
Each and every night
My soul is cryin' out to you
It's reaching out for somethin' true 
Do I have to go
To get you into my life
The suspense is tearing me, tearing me apart

Won't you bring your love
Bring it all to me
So we can live together eternally
Will you be mine?

[Repeat Chorus]",Will You Be Mine,1983
Anita Baker,"You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

An understanding hand, when the world calls me grand
You protected my heart, right from the start
Sensitive vibes are strong and true
The very best I've always shared with you

And if I should fall or if I'm standing tall
I can see you standing there, always willing to share
Each and every part of me
You see things I never, never see

And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life
And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

Deep down in my mind, mind
I wonder at the blessing that I could find
Someone as loving as you
Could bring into my life this feeling so right and so true

Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be

You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life
And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be, yeah

You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life
You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

You're so wonderful, you're so beautiful
You're the best thing yet to ever come into my life
You're so wonderful, you're so beautiful
You're the best thing yet to ever come into my life",Your're the Best Thing Yet,1983
Anita Baker,"Ah, many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close 
I think I'll pray
    
I hear you say you've got a lot to give up
And there is so much more this heart of mine can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive you send it right away
Right away
    
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
Good love. good love
Good love, good love

There is a void that stands between us
And it seems it's getting harder to relate
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine 
Life this way

I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time

Hear me when I say, bring it to me baby
    
Babe. you're the man I hear you say you are 
I don't quite understand why loving me is so hard
Never have I felt the need to be this close
Words cannot say, heaven only knows 
    
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time

",Good Love,1988
Anita Baker,"When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be, sweet fatal attraction
My lifelong date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'

Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you
Just because you're you

You're a diamond in my mind. a treasure found
A precious gem to me. you're so nice to have around
I'm so glad I took the path that led to this
And it's amazin' loving you, I'm doin' things
I never thought I'd do

I don't know, there ain't no explanation
Of why I'm sharin' love at last this way
I won't try to work out all my reasons
I'll use these words to simply say

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby.

Could it be that there's more to this than meets the eye
Maybe that's the reason why
All I know is when I'm in your arms it feels all right
I'll hold you tight and I come alive

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you",Just Because,1988
Anita Baker,"We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now oooh

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control oooh baby
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love 

I'm deep in the miracle of you oooh",Lead Me Into Love,1988
Anita Baker,"Love was meant to be loving
So many times we don't give, we take
Love has really no conception to this rule
Days you gave me were numbered
And as a rule they were hard to take
All it took was the number of a fool
Rules were made to be broken
So many hearts break the same way too, aw baby
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule, yes sir
Your answer begging my question
It seems I left you too late to ask
Was this really your intention
From the start
The nights you left me are empty, baby
As for the answer, they changed the past
I tried to let you explain your change of heart
How could you change your mind
Rules were made to be broken 
So many hearts break the same way too, aw honey
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
How could they say
It would be better this way?without you
When by the usual rules
I kept presuming that you would stay, baby
So many hearts break the same way too, no mister
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
You?
Gonna get on my bad heart
Just like everybody asks you
You've gotta help baby
You've gotta help me convert, too
You better hear what I'm telling you",Rules,1988
Anita Baker,"I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight

She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-uh
No, uh-huh-mmm-mmm

She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragons, defeat the evil prince
She said he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story, it would be good for me

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
My story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality, now, said I
Don't feel the need to be pacified,
Don't cha try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
I found no magic potion, no horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apply, my destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me, no magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over, my life must now begin

My story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise or fairy tales

I've been looking for you
Where did you go
I'm pacing the floor
When you're gone from me
I'm pacing this floor
Baby, I stand by you so close
Caution is not my approach
My heart I expose, ooh
More than you know
Wasting my time
Everybody says I'm
Wasting my time
I must reply
That the time I waste 
Is certainly mine

There's a picture in my memory
Of the days when we first met
When solo became duet

And so good to know when you need me
I'll be there
It's a perfect love affair
And so good to know that you love me and you care, baby, you care
Now I welcome love's affliction
Though its symptoms I deny
Contention, we harmonize
Yes a heart of ice was melted
And the mountains they did move
Baby, you've nothing left to prove
'Cause it's a prefect love affair
And so good to know that you love me and you care
It's a perfect love affair
And so good to know that you love me and you care

It would take my heart from me
I can't imagine life without you
The love of you, baby
Lately I confess
I've been short on tenderness
Too much time on work, I guess
Not enough on you
Now if I forgot to tell you I love you
I really got no excuse, no excuse
Because you're beautiful, my one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it, well I do now
You're my sweet inspiration- baby, baby
If I'm feelin' low
I've only got myself to blame

Say it's alright
Would you baby
It will be alright
If I could only see you
Won't you please do this for me

Yesterday it was when you walked out my door

Baby see what Iv'e done, Baby see what Iv'e done
Oh yeah holding on to my pillow is all Iv'e got

Belongs to someone new

How we ever made it is a mystery to me
Fire and water were never meant to be

And you miss the time together that you shared
For a little while you feel all alone and scared

And you, you not only lose your balance
But you lose your rhythm and

And love? Oh yes, love has a rhythm

Anita Baker,"Were we ever, did we use it up too fast
Our great moments never met to last
And the last thing that I want
Is to ever make your smile go away
Keep the memories take the best of what we had
I can't stand to watch what once was great go bad
And if I can't be with you
Then I rather just remember what we knew

[Chorus]
When you love someone
And you love them with your heart
And it doesn't disappear if you're apart
When you love someone 
And you've done all you can do - you've done all you can
When you set them free
And if that love is true
When you love someone 
It will all come back to you
Nights I wondered was I too much that we gave
If we gave in more could we have both been saved
And I guess we have crossed the line
Never knowing what was yours
And what was mine

[Chorus]
And through it all, I still have no regrets
Just promise me - promise me
You never will forget - you never will forget

And you have done all you can do
And you set them free and if that love is true
If you love someone, it will all come back to you",When You Love Someone,1995

I won't be denied

The pleasure of your kisses

The pleasure of your smile

I'll always be here

Just because I'm near you

It doesn't mean I won't disappear

Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Of once upon a time

Slowly creepin' on me

And they linger on my mind


Just let somebody love you

I just don't know why

Whenever I get close to you

You want to run and hide

We began lovers' dance

The road was smooth to romance

And we sang love sweet song every day


I believe that love would stay in my heart

Now it's torn all apart

It's gone away, I can't stay, I've got to say

I don't believe that you could do me this way


Now don't you understand

I'm in need of comfort

The comfort of your hand in mine

And what I feel inside

Why don't you come closer

I can't hide


Been so long

Been so long . . . can't hide

Been so long

Been so long . . . it's too long, won't you come on, baby

Been so long . . . won't you come home, see about me

see about me

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

Comfort and joy

And let's pretend that we?re up there just you and I,
Let's pretend that no one knew where to find us in the blue,
Let's pretend our dreams come true as years go by.

Do they wander side by side,
And do their dreams into the future wind,
Do they still recall the day when she turned to him to say,
Darling take my hand and let's pretend.

And kisses the roses round my window sill

To wake up in the morning to the mockin' bird's trill

Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio
Soft desert stars and the strum of guitars
Makes every evening seem so sweet
In my adobe hacienda life and love are more complete

Evening breezes softly murmur harmony with whippoorwills
When setting sun says the long day is done
Sweet music starts to fill the air
In my adobe hacienda harmony is everywhere

But they never see you walking with me and somehow they don't understand

We must face each blue tomorrow with a pair of broken hearts
True love never had a chance dear when a foolish quarrel starts
So we paid for our romance dear with a pair of broken hearts

Verse 1:
Memories that linger in my heart,
Memories that make my heart grow cold,
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my blue moon again will turn to gold.

Chorus:
When my blue moon turns to gold again,
When the raindrops turn the clouds away,
When my blue moon turns to gold again,
You'll be back here in my arms to stay.

Verse2:
The castles we built in dreams together
Tell the sweetest story ever told,
Someday we'll live them all again
When my blue moon again will turn to gold.
[Chorus]

Verse3:
The lips that used to thrill me so,
Your kisses were meant for only me.
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my golden moon is just a memory.

",When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again,1994
Anita Carter,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Him Was Easier,1997

Knowing there's no hope for us
Turns these rings of gold to rust

You will not betray my trust

At a little roadhouse called the Get Down Here
A cinder block building with a hand-painted sign
Hunkered down straddling the county lines

When the crowd rolled in they were a motley mix
There were truckers and bikers and locals from the sticks
Each one meaner than a cougar in a cage
And the biggest one swaggered right up to the stage

He said, â??Weâ??ve heard everybody from David Allen Coe 
To Chuck Berry singing â??go Johnny go go
Got an autographed picture of Elvis on the shelf
So tell me girl what you got to say for yourself

Now he was over in the corner with a chesire smile
The best lookinâ?? seventeen miles
Sittinâ?? there makinâ?? my poor heart sweet
I knew my chances were a long shot bet
Because a boy like that heâ??s heard every line
And Iâ??ve never been the silver-tongue kind
But I figured I had me one chance
Of gettinâ?? that boy to dance
So I cranked up my amp...

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, and maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2007

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

I count all the charms about Linda
And lately it seems
In all of my dreams
I walk with my arms about Linda
But what good does it do me for Linda
Doesn't know that I exist?
Can't help feeling gloomy
Think of all the lovin' I've missed
We pass on the street
My heart skips a beat
I say to myself, ""Hello, Linda""

With one lucky break

Wet night flowers, red and black
Push me up they can't give me up

I call them, baby, baby, baby

Can't get me up
Can't push me up
Can't fill me up
Can't give it up
I've been crushed

Stars spit down
They try to hammer me underground
There is a black rainbow astride
This hallowed ground

Black rainbow I pull it down
I pull it down pull it down
This nervous night this nervous
Nervous night swallows the eye

I drown my hands, I lay them down
The fools seduction tools
Let you go into the sun

The dirt delivers me

Anita O'Day,"He would spend it on the ponies,
He would spend it on the girls,
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old henna'd curls.
And when his wife said, ""Hey now!
What did you get for me?""
He socked her in the chopper,
Such a sweet sweet guy was he!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

How he loved the old race horses,
He would bet them every day.
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay!
He indulged in fancy spending,
Ordered rings, cars and furs,
But alas, alack,
Like a stab in the back,
She found out they were not hers!

She's a real sad tomato,

He got mixed up with a Flo,
So Flo shoved him in the river,
He'll not get mixed up no more!
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine,
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy,
No insurance could she find.

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy

Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

Anita O'Day,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Anita O'Day,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?

And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?",Frenesi,1958

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""`till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanitorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

Anita O'Day,"Do nothing till you hear from me,
Pay no attention to what's said.
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dreams
Is over my head.

Do nothing till you hear from me,
At least consider our romance.
If you should take the words of others you've heard,
I haven't a chance.

True, I've been seen with someone new,
But does that mean that I've been untrue?
When we're apart, 
The words in my heart 
Reveal how I feel about you.

Some kiss may cloud my memories,
And other arms may hold a thrill,
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will.

I was not ready for the winter
It makes no difference at all 
Cause I wear boots all summer long

My makeup dark and it's careless
Same circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin 
Is my eyes without any shadow

And when I call
Will you walk gently
Through my shadow
The ones who sing at night

The ones you dream of 

The ones who walk away 
With their capes pulled around them tight
Cryin for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight

And the blankets that I love
Sometimes I am surrounded 
By too much love

But what care I?
Such pride inside me has woken,
I'll try my best not to cry,
By and by,
When the final farewells must be spoken.
I'll join the Legion,
That's what I'll do.
And in some far distant region,
Where human hearts are staunch and true,
I shall start my life anew.
Good-bye, it's time
I sought a foreign clime,
Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.
And so, I go,
To fight a savage foe,
Although I know that
I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.
In some Abyssinian French Dominion
I shall do my bit,
And fall for the flag if I must.

You won't see my heels for the dust.
I'll do or die
You'll know the reason why

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk;

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely presents you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

Started yankin' the bell!

I got a shock and I changed my mind,
A miracle happened to me.

If the moon turns green and shadows get up and walk around,
And clouds come tumbling to the ground,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
If the stars turn blue and Willows that weep begin to sing,
And winter changes into Spring,
I wouldn't raise my eyes,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
I thought I was foolish to think of romance 
With someone so charming as you,
Thought I was hoping without any chance.
But ev'ry hope came true.

And this is all a crazy dream,

Anita O'Day,"This town is full of guys who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You can see them every day, strolling up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
You'll see wise guys and boosters,
Card sharps and crap shooters,
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear those flashy ties and collars,
But where they get their dollars,
They've all got an ace down in the hole.

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
That's their ace in the hole.
Others have girls on that old tenderloin,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips they are going to take,
From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,
If they lost that old ace in the hole.

Wherever you might stray, along the Great White Way,
They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.
But every hustler knows
Bullshit buys no clothes
And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,
But all of them have aces in the hole.

Drifters who dwell on that slippery slope,
Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of money they've made and they've spent
And flash a Missouri bankroll.
But their names would be mud,
Like a chump dealing stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole.",Ace in the Hole,2003
Anita O'Day,"If you ain't wrong, you're right
If it ain't day, it's night
If you ain't sure, you might
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't dry, it's wet
If you ain't got, you get
If it ain't gross, it's net
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't sis, you can't miss
It's got to be your brother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other

If it ain't full, it's blank
If you don't spend, you bank
If it ain't Dee, it's Frank
Gotta be this or that",Gotta Be This or That,2003

Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek

Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Anita O'Day,"See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul,
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
And she promised she would always love me

Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain",Body & Soul,2003
Anita O'Day,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

who's how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
'cause I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

Verse One:

I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
'cause you wasn't tryin to see 
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
'cause you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

Verse Two:

Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
'cause it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
through thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Verse Three:

I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears
Happy as can be
To see man woman and child
As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out
Can't let em see us fall
But most of all 
Thank you God
'cause for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

Oh I want to thank you for all you've done for me

Anita Tijoux,"Como ves, abajo es arriba
Por las noches aparece el dia
Armonia, bienvenido, nuberia
Hartos, contentos, encuentros, partidas

Venga venga, esta es nuestra verdad
No es sencillo en un sismo despertar
Sin otra que la cruda realidad
Cuando reacciono me da por gritar cantar

Hasta llenar el vacio
Por que hay un algo, interno, en rocio
Como un cirio que vela por su crio
No ha regresado, no andaba perdido

Como ves que las sombras son activas
Entre broches descansa la agonia
Sintonia, bienvenido, nuberia
Hartos contentos si al centro arrivas

Como ves, ves, como crees, crees
Como crees crees

Toc, toc, toc, toc, toc, toca toca
Toca, tactica, tecnica, toc, toc, toca
Trota, galopa, poc, poc, poca
Si la hora demora, solo le creo a la aurora

Como crees, crees, que como lo ves, ves
Es, todo lo que ves
Es que esto no es lo que es
Tal vez no es realidad

Cada uno tiene su verdad
Es que todo lo que brilla no es oro
Lo invisible puede ser un tesoro
Cual es la mentira?
Si el final puede ser la partida

Como ves, ves, como crees, crees
Veo el dia de hoy
Como ves, ves, como crees, crees
Creo de donde yo soy

Como ves, ves, como crees, crees
Soy lo que yo soy
Como ves, ves, como crees, crees
Creo y voy, como crees, crees

Anita Tijoux,"Eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi lo oigo todo el tiempo
Eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi

La sombra que pasa la luz que me abraza
Tus ojos mirándome la calle que canta
Su canto de diario el mundo moviéndose
Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un buen
Momento para ti y para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Pero eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi lo oigo todo el tiempo
Eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi

El espejo que da su reflejo en todo
Lo pinta tal como es mi cuerpo que no tiene peso
Si escucho tu voz y amándome
Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un buen
Momento para ti y para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Temes sentir mas de la cuenta
El corazón es un musculo si no late
Revienta extraño mirarte de lejos de
Hacernos los tontos parecemos tan viejos
Tiempo que dices tiempo mírame la piel
No ves acaso lo que siento
Tu eres para mi yo soy para ti
El viento me lo dijo con un soplo suavecillo

Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un
Buen momento para ti (para mi)
Y para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Pero eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi lo oigo todo el tiempo
Eres para mi
(Tal para cual como el mar y la sal)
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi
(Sigue mi cadencia pierdo la paciencia
Tu eres para mi no te das cuenta)
Eres para mi

Me lo dijo con un soplo suavecillo)

Naci un dia de junio
Del año 77
Planeta mercurio
Y el año de la serpiente
Sin o patente
Tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
Marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar
Sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana Maria
Si seria el primer llanto
Que me probaría
Quemando las heridas
Y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto
Construyendo cada efecto
Correcto, incorrecto, sé aprender todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas
Queran el daño
Subir peldaño
Toma tiempo toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban
Y el invierno en gran verano
Papa me regalo bajo mi insistenso
Juego, trataba de culparte y recibencia
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando senti mi primera impotencia

1977 no me digan no
Que uno lo presiente
Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

Mi adolescencia
Fue una etapa bizarra
El cuerpo es batería
Y la cabeza guitarra
La orquesta narronato
Nada quebrada para la mirada
De una niña que solo talla espadas
Hormona disparada
Sobre poblada sin formas
En que cambian temporadas
Caminas en crucijadas
Cada cual es su morada
Preparaba la carnada
La sagrada diablada
De mirada encabronada
Mi fila la verdad
Nunca busco su silla
Mi búsqueda fue mero
Proceso de pura pila
Pupila de poeta
Que marco nuestra saliba
En la cordillera que miraba la salida
La parada militar de paso monótono
Colores policromolos
Uniformes de poco tono
Detono mi cuestionamento
La voz si sonó no
Mi primera rima que sonó
Y me enrrolo
Mi búsqueda no fue para mi cosa de escenario
Fue algo necesario
Que marcaba ya mi fallo
Así que todas
Mas de lo necesario
Fue cuando entendí
Que todos quieren ser corsario

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

I'm trying to convey the sentiment of my heart, and say
I really do appreciate the way You brighten up my day

I can't find the words to describe You
It would take a million years
It would take a million years to explain the way I feel
You are the epitome, You are the epitome of everything I'll ever need
I'm so in awe of You, Lord You leave me speechless

Now if I had more time
I would go down the line
And name all the things that captivate my heart
But clearly I'm not aware of words that can compare
How do I communicate exactly who You are?

And found there's no expression that can define
The way You cared for me throughout the hands of time
I'm searching for a word to say
That You take my breath away

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't find the words to describe You
It would take a million years
It would take a million years to explain the way I feel

Say Lord You leave me speechless

Anita Wilson,"The very first thought on my mind
When I wake up with You
A love like Yours is so hard to find
Makes me feel brand new
Out of all the people in this world
So glad You chose me
I just can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody

I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That You keep blessing me 
Beyond all my wildest dreams 
And You come to me
Show me that You love me
And believe abundantly
Even things I can't see
I am so complete
All because You love me

I can't help but think about the times
When I needed a friend
I was broke and deep down inside
It was hard to pretend
That when I opened up my heart to You 
And You set me free
Can't nobody do me like You do
Your love captured me

I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That You keep blessing me 
Beyond all my wildest dreams 
And You come to me
Show me that You love me
And believe abundantly
Even things I can't see
I am so complete
All because You love me

Can't imagine how my life would be 
If You didn't feel this way about me
You've given me the strength to believe
Just have the faith of a mustard seed
I can conquer anything

I'm not afraid to say that You love me
You love me
Oh, thank You, Lord
You love me, You love me
I am so grateful that You love me 
When everybody else gave up on me
You loved me, you loved me
You really really really really love me
No greater love have I found 
Than the love He gives to me
I found real love, I said real love in Jesus

I've been in love before
But I never experienced so much joy

Bolei, vou garantir em questão de segundos
Perdeu, vim avisar que existe mas esse já é meu oh
Esse aqui é meu

Pirei, tô arrasando e elas tão com inveja que eu sei

É realmente dela
Nunca perde a validade

E seu sorriso lindo iluminando sua vida inteira

É teu perfume, flor, cravo, canela e alecrim
Procurando alguém
Só pra cuidar do seu jardim
Regando sua vida todo dia até o fim

Dizer te amo sim
Provar do que é bom
E ter você pra mim

Te encontro pro amor

E a gente se encontrava e namorava na laje

Que eu tinha no peito um coração vagabundo

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2008
Anja Garbarek,"I am in this mood
It's good, it's the best place to be
I got in
I got in
I got in to the mood
This great big balloon
Carrying me to the sky
Above everything
Above you

Balloon mood

I'm in a balloon mood



",Balloon Mood,1996
Anja Garbarek,"It happens that someone knocks at my door
And the whole house starts to shake
So that it gets really hard to stand up
And even worse to walk
I usually fall down on the floor

And I stay there until that someone decides to leave
And the house calms down
And I look through the curtains
To see if he would regret
To see if he would try again

It happens that someone calls me on the phone
Then my heart gets so scared
That it jumps right up into my throat!
I swallow like crazy
Hoping my heart will glide back down
So I can talk to that someone
Maybe talk to a friend
But it is too late

It is beyond my control 
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
I'm not to blame. It isn't my fault
It was you that made my heart shake
It was you that made my heart jump

And it happens that I take a walk outside
Just to get some nice fresh air
And it happens that I see someone I knew
A long, long time ago

Then I just seem to disappear
Becoming one with a wall
Becoming one with a lamp post
Becoming one with a tree
Becoming one with a street
Becoming one with a house
Becoming one with a door
Becoming one with you all

It is beyond my control
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
It is beyond my control
If I just seem to disappear
It is beyond my control
If I am suddenly not here

I'm not to blame. It isn't my fault
It was you that made my heart shake
It was you that made my heart jump

It was you that came my way",Beyond My Control,1996
Anja Garbarek,"I'm lying as far out
Towards the edge
As possible
So far out
That I'm almost tripping over
You lie behind me
Your breath is heavy
You're sleeping

There are some screws
That are coming loose
From two holes in the wall
The plaster's sifting down
Resting like sleep-sand in my eyes

There's a cabinet
(Hanging over my bed)
Filled with all my secret things
(Filled with all my secret things)
Every night I lie
(Staring at it)
I'm so afraid that it will fall down
Onto my face

I know what is keeping
My cabinet from falling down

It's very a small bird
Made of ceramics
Fastened by a thread
To the bottom of the cabinet
When you're awake
You play around with it
Then I get so scared
That the thread won't be strong enough

I'm hiding my head under the pillow
Hoping that
The bird won't fly away

There's a cabinet
(Hanging above my bed)
Filled with all my secrets things
(Filled with secret things)
Every night I lie
(Staring up at it)
I'm so afraid that it will fall down

'Cause what if the cabinet
(Were to fall down)
And what if it hit my face
(Would you get frightened by)
The things that you would see
(The things that you would see)
Or would try to mend it
(Would you even try)
There's a cabinet
Hanging above my bed
Filled with secret things



",The Cabinet,1996
Anja Garbarek,"Give me a nutra sweet talking guy
Give an insulation man
Give me a helium kind of boy
Give me anyone

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Give me a nutra sweet talking guy
Who can make me feel real
Like a glucose custard cake
Served on a styrofoam plate

I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for much, now am I?
I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for much

Give me a helium kind of boy
Who can blow up my mind
Like a zeppelin into the sky
Like the Hindenburg

Give me an insulation man
Who can keep me warm
Holding me snugly in his arms
In an asbestos embrace

",I.C.U.,1996
Anja Garbarek,"I woke up today
In the apartment of a stranger
I was so certain
That it was my own door
That I unlocked last night
But, there may be someone here
Who has disguised all my rooms
All my rooms

Oooh

Later in the day
A figure came through the door
A shadow that barely nearly touched my body
Then moving its mouth persistently
Open and shut
Open and shut

Ooh,
I'm searching while I'm screaming out to them :
'Now you may come out
Come out
Now you may come out'

As I walk around searching
And wondering whether this may be
A conspiracy by the figure and them
I hear someone laughing
From inside the closet
There's someone in the closet
Someone in the closet

I push the door open
And stare straight into my home
I have found them all

Ooh, I'm searching
No longer now
That I can join laughter
Laugh at everything
Now that I can join in

Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Anja Garbarek,"Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...

Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.
Pick it all up now.

Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.

And swallow...

Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...

You took away my red lips,
And then cut them up in pieces.

So now I can't kiss the moon,
So now I can't kiss the moon goodnight.
No longer fly,
Through the clouds.
No longer touch the starsâ?¦

Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...

I'm lying still,
Waiting.

Completely dried out,
Longing.
Longing,
For the rain
To whip the roof

And make me,
Defencelessâ?¦

You took my lips away,
You took my red lips.
You took my lips away,
You took my soft, red lipsâ?¦

",Picking up Pieces,1996
Anja Garbarek,"It was getting to be difficult to walk
She was always so close but never right on
And the roads she chose to walk were narrow
Alleys with names
Hard to understand

Her head was dangling back and forth
She wished to lay it down
But it would roll away
So she put her foot down with care
While she leaned on everybody
So as not to fall

And they told her
The latest tattletales

â??I collect stuff like that, you've got
To have a thing or two to tellâ??.
She said
While her one lip fell down
From her mouth
She picked it up off the ground
But, when she was to put it
Back in place again,
The lip would fit no more,
The lip would fit no moreâ?¦

She very rarely blinked her eyes
'Cause it just might happen she would miss out on things
So when she opened both her eyes up wide.
They popped right out
And rolled along
To see just the things she
Wanted to see

â??I collect stuff like that, you've got
To have a thing or two to tellâ??.
She said
While her one lip fell down
From her mouth.
She picked it up off the ground
But, when she was to put it
Back in place again,
The lip would fit no more,

Somewhere.
I don't quite remember where.

I don't remember who

Nor the year.
And I cannot recall

",Something Written,1996
Anja Garbarek,"There were these two people
Living together in a peculiar house
This house was so peculiar
Because it made such strange noises

The couple decided that they had to move
They could no longer stand living with such strange noises
So they packed their bags and
Put on their propeller hats

And so they flew
High above the ocean and forests and mountains
To find a place
Yeah they flew far into heaven to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
So - quiet

But heaven was no permanent place for this silence seeking copule
Because there there were sounds too
Sky sounds
So they left the place
So they left the place

They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
Absolutly quiet

They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place

But everywhere they went there were these sounds
Strange sounds
Somebody else's sounds
And somebody else's sounds are lot worse to live with than one's own

So the couple found that they might as well go back home
They took off their propeller hats and
Descended between the stars

East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best
East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best



",Strange Noises,1996
Anja Garbarek,"Aaah - aaah

It was a clear blue night
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
We heard a voice

Look up at the sky
And please count the stars for me

One
One

One, ooh so lonely star
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Clinging to the void

The sky would soon
Have only the moon to shine

Make a wish
Make a wish
Make a wish
Make a wish

Close your eyes
Close your eyes

Everytime a wish comes true
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
A star falls from the sky

You've made
You've made too many wishes
Too many wishes

Only one wish
Star ligt star bright
A wish we may
We wish we might
Have this last wish tonight
We wish for all the stars to shine
To reappear in the sky
Called upon once more by you
So that our children may have wishes too
