Casting Crowns,"The love of her life is drifting away
Their losing the fight for another day
The life that she's known is falling apart
A fatherless home, a childs broken heart
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
She's desperate for hope
Darkness clouding her view
She's looking to you

Just love her like Jesus
Carry her to him
His yoke is easy
His burden is light
You don't need the answers
To all of life's questions
Just know that He loves her
Stay by her side
And love her like Jesus
Love her like Jesus

The gifts lie in wait in a room painted blue
A little blessing from heaven will be there soon
Hope fades into night,
Blue skies turn into grey
As the little one slips away
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
They're desperate for hope
Darkness clouding their view
They're looking to you

[Chorus:]
So love them like Jesus
Love them like Jesus
You don't need the answers
To all of lifes questions
Just know that He loves them
Stay by their side

Lord of all creation holds our life in His hand
The God of all the nations holds our lives in His hands
The rock of our salvation holds our lives in His hands
He cares for them just as He cares for you.

Casting Crowns,"Away in a manger
No crib for a bed 
The little Lord Jesus 
Laid down His sweet head 

The stars in the sky 
Looked down where He lay 
The little Lord Jesus 
Asleep on the hay 

The cattle are lowing 
The Baby awakes 
The little Lord Jesus 
No crying He makes 

I love Thee, Lord Jesus 
Look down from the sky 
And stay by my cradle 
Till morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay 
Close by me forever 
And love me I pray 

Bless all the dear children 
In Thy tender care 
And fate us for heaven 
To live with Thee there

Casting Crowns,"It hasn't always been this way
I remember brighter days
Before the dark ones came
Stole my mind
Wrapped my soul in chains

Now I live among the dead
Fighting voices in my head
Hoping someone hears me crying in the night
And carries me away

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

Morning breaks another day
Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?
The dark ones shriek
They scream his name
Is this the one they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free 

And as the god man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
And darkness cannot hide

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

You are free
You are free
You are free
We are free
We are free

Casting Crowns,"Careless, I am reckless
I'm a wrong way traveling, slowly unraveling, shell of a man
Burn out, I'm so numb now
That the fire's just an ember way down in the corner, of my cold, cold heart

Lord this time, I'll make it right
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come and my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Here at the altar
Oh my world so black and white
How could I ever falter
What you've show me to be right

Lord this time (Lord this time)
I'll make it right (make it right)
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come, but my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through

I'm trying so hard, to stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are

Casting Crowns,"Here I am lord and I'm drowning
In your sea of forgetfulness
The chains of yesterday surround me
I yearn for peace and rest
I don't want to end up where you found me
And it echoes in my mind
Keeps me awake tonight

I know you've cast my sin as far
As the east is from the west
And I stand before you now
As though I've never sinned
But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I start the day, the war begins
Endless reminding of my sin
And time and time again
Your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in
Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I know you've washed me white
Turned my darkness into light
I need your peace to get me through
To get me through this night

I can't live by what I feel
About the truth your word reveals
And I'm not holding onto you
But you're holding onto me
You're holding onto me

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again

From one scarred hand to the other

Casting Crowns,"I'm the man with all I've wanted
All the toys and playing games
I am the one who pours your coffee
Corner booth each Saturday

I am your daughter's favorite teacher
I'm the leader of the band
I sit behind you in the bleachers
I am every man

I'm the coach of every winning team
And still a loser in my mind
I am the soldier in the airport
Facing giants one more time

I am the woman shamed and haunted
By the cry of unborn life
I am every broken man
Nervous child, lonely wife

Is there hope for every man?
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
Is there hope for every man?

Is there love that never dies
Is there peace in troubled times
Someone help me understand
Is there hope for every man?

It seems there's just so many roads to travel
It's hard to tell where they will lead
My life is scarred, my dreams unraveled
Now I am scared to take the lead

If I could find someone to follow
Who knows my pain and feels the way
The uncertainty of my tomorrow
The guilt and pain of yesterday

Is there hope for every man?
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
Is there hope for every man?

Is there love that never dies
Is there peace in troubled times
Someone help me understand
Is there hope for every man?

There is hope for every man
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
There is hope for every man

There is love that never dies
There is peace in troubled times
Will we help them understand
Jesus is hope for every man

I lift my friend to You
Complicated circumstances have clouded his view

I pray for Your wisdom, oh God, and a heart that's sincere

I want so much to help him, but this is something he has to do

But You know where that leads

Casting Crowns,"Be careful little eyes what you see
It's the second glance that ties your hands
As darkness pulls the strings
Be careful little feet where you go
For it's the little feet behind you that are sure to follow

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade

Be careful little ears what you hear
When flattering leads to compromises, the end is always near
Be careful little lips what you say
For empty words and promises leave broken hearts astray

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade

The journey from your mind to your hands
Is shorter than you're thinking
Be careful if you think you stand
You just might be sinking

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away

People never crumble in a day
Daddies never crumble in a day
Families never crumble in a day

Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
For the Father up above is looking down in love
Oh, be careful little eyes what you see",Slow Fade,2007
Casting Crowns,"Somewhere between the hot and the cold
Somewhere between the new and the old
Somewhere between who I am and who I used to be
Somewhere in the middle, you'll find me

Somewhere between the wrong and the right
Somewhere between the darkness and the light
Somewhere between who I was and who you're making me
Somewhere in the middle, you'll find me

Just how close can I get, lord, to my surrender without losing all control

Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common sense
Deep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middle
With eyes wide open to the differences, the god we want and the god who is
But will we trade our dreams for his or are we caught in the middle
Are we caught in the middle

Somewhere between my heart and my hands
Somewhere between my faith and my plans
Somewhere between the safety of the boat and the crashing waves

Somewhere between a whisper and a roar
Somewhere between the altar and the door
Somewhere between contented peace and always wanting more
Somewhere in the middle you'll find me

Just how close can I get, lord, to my surrender without losing all control

Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common sense
Deep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middle
With eyes wide open to the differences, the god we want and the god who is
But will we trade our dreams for his or are we caught in the middle

Casting Crowns,"What this world needs
Is not another one-hit wonder with an axe to grind
Another two-bit politician peddling lies
Another three-ring circus society

What this world needs
Is not another sign-waving super- that thinks he's better than you
Another ear-pleasing candy man afraid of the truth
Another prophet in an Armani suite

What this world needs is a savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love them
In their time of need
A savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love
That's what this world needs

What this world needs
Is for us to care more about the inside than the outside
Have we become so blind that we can't see
God's gotta change your heart before he changes a shirt
What this world needs
Is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance
Blending in so well that people can't see the difference
And it's the difference that sets the world free

People aren't confused by the gospel
They're confused by us

My denomination or my translation of the bible
They just need Jesus
We can be passionate about what we believe
But we can't strap ourselves to the gospel

'Cause we're slowing it down
Jesus is going to save the world
But maybe the best thing we can do
Is just get out of the way

Casting Crowns,"Looking out from his throne
The father of light and of men
Chose to make himself known
And show us the way back to him

Speaking wisdom and truth
Into the hearts of peasants and kings
He began to unveil
The word that would change the course of all things

With eyes wide open all would see

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive

Simple strokes on a page
Eternity's secrets revealed
Carried on from age to age
It speaks truth to us even still

As the rain falls from heaven
Feeds the earth before it returns
Lord, let your word fall on us
And bring forth the fruit you deserve

With eyes wide open let us see

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive

The bible was inscribed over a period of 2000 years
In times of war and in days of peace
By kings, physicians, tax collectors, farmers, fishermen, singers and shepherds
The marvel is that a library so perfectly cohesive
Could have been produced by such a diverse crowd
Over a period of time which stagers the imagination
Jesus is it's grand subject our good is designed and the glory of God is its end

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe

And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same

Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn
Facing for sinners death on the cross

Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
Blind and unheeding, dying for me

Praying for sinners while in such woe
No one but Jesus ever loved so

One day they nailed Him to die on a tree

Said one old man to the other
It once shined bright, and it would be shining still

And the soldiers thought the poets were weak
And the elders saw the young ones as foolish
And the rich man never heard the poor man speak

I'm screaming at the midnight air
Everyone hears me but I don't care
My heart's clenched just like a fist
'Cause, people, I didn't ask for any of this
And I'm not fine
I'm not fine

In the company of strangers
In a cold and sterile room
All alone with a child inside me
And I don't know what to do
Jesus, can You hear me
Come and heal my brokenness
Put the pieces back together
And be a Father to the fatherless

Twenty-one finds me
Blowing out candles and making wishes
And all around me
My barefoot princess twirls and sings
It's so amazing
Looking back at all God's brought us through
You are my happy birthday
And you were born to break the chains

Now I know, I know
It's not just another birthday
'Cause I'm here, she's here
And look how far we've come
Since you've called me, saw me
Held me and freed me
Thank you, Lord, for another birthday
And we'll be fine
We'll be fine",Just Another Birthday,2011

You forgot he was even there, but you've never slipped his mind
He's living off of scraps of you you never knew you left behind
And as the sun goes down, he rises with a smile

He's waiting on the night to fall
The old man's coming to call

He'll never step out in the light
No, he's just biding time

And the sword that you could slay him with has become an ornament and nothing else
You could put him back down in his hole in the ground, but he knows you never will
He's been around so long you got used to the smell

But he will gladly rob you blind
While you're feasting at his table, he'll tie your hands and numb your mind
He'll take you farther than you wanna go
He'll keep you longer than you wanna stay
And it will cost you more than you ever thought you'd pay

Can you feel it?

Castor McCord,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts,
Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny,1996

But I'm not gonna sit home and cry

Uh huh I'm ripping rapping dough dotters
Giving strow rhythm cause his flow propper
And like it ruff like some more vodka

Organized block cinemas away from the prison
With souls, lost rows and so on
Fall victim to the streets and so much can go wrong
Rebels meet crumble and majesties for salaries
Out of towners and goose downers introduce pounders
A lay loot for power evil roots shoot through cowards
Lettin other niggas just regulate they hours
Coke or chronic, philly roll millie by his scrotum

Casual,"Understand this man is the grand est 
The mighty dreaded niggaz step and get beheaded 
Shredded left a battered broken man 
Chosen hand busted from the tussle from the mic which I ignite 
Like a pyromaniac don't play me that's 
Not recommended you're winded your girl lays me back 
And I attack the twat viciously 
Got it twitchin' she's a bitch to the dopefiend beat 
Hope we meet in the next lifetime 
For the strife I'm, the nigga with the better rhyme 
Hoes think I'm adorable, MC's think I'm oracle 
Foolish mortal, I got the flows so call your crew 
And crush the earth's crust because I bust 
Thunderous, I'm breakin' niggaz down to dust 
The rhyme sorceror forces you to shout my praises 
Phenomenal phrases hit you like exploding razors 

Now who put the West up on the map? 
Perhaps you should run laps, you're wack with a stack of dumb raps 
Thumbtacks mark your headquarters 
You're dead when I slaughter, and now your head's leaking red water 
You shoulda been a donor, I'm prone to bone ya hoe 
Though she know I can flow, 'cause I showed her 
And now she's up on my shit, I'm slick 
I rhyme quick, and I'm the shit, dick 
Hieroglyphics in the house like punishment 
Who is running shit, A-Plus is the one to get 
Foul, if you think I'm flippin' on the man with the skills 
Niggaz get the dills, still 
Hieroglyphics sound the lights, surround the mics 
I pound the lights 'cause they haven't found the light 
But I never taught ya discipline, feel my fist again 
If it's in your face, get a taste, 'cause you commit the sin

When Captain Tajai throws his weight it's hard 
The verbs they scourge I fly nerds while I be fine 
Put on your radar, I don't stay far 
That's why men are noid, I irritate like hemmaroids (ouch) 
You made the proper preperations, I still ate ya 
I hate ya, I rate the 
Mindstate of niggaz that I'm greater, none of that later 
We can do this I wreck blocks like Brutus 
It's not a chore ta, make you come up shorter 
'cause niggaz know I'm sure to serve without takin no orders 
So here's a tip from the hip to your dips 
Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips 
I'll do you swell, I got better aim than Willie Tell 
I rung so let me ring your bell 
DING-DONG! My sing song swells like a Samolian 
Stuck in my pocket, I simply rock it 

Call it splat on your face when you try to face the match 
You're tripping you're slipping you're sliding off my fly blend 
Of wording, soon to be hurting, a nerd teen rabbit 
Peace to the niggaz who got my back and 
Everyone else can get the dills

You rag and boast about your coast but it really don't phase me

Follow the funk

Coolin, just like the man's supposed to
You know the most who respect a fool and a post crew
I often catch static brothers beef and they tellin me
Jealousy let it be, 'cause I got funk with my melon
Now it's time to rhyme and tell a G this fella be
Movin steadily ahead of me is a void
Emptyness you're less than best you're just wimpiest
I decapitate a rapper's fate with my niftiness
And I slip the fresh shit under your nose
I get the mess hall rockin, all jockin
A fly brother, a poet slow it down to enrich my pitch
Ask Mike P is it likely we can switch a bitch
Affirmative and now I learn to live trifiling
When a skin pretends it's the end, who she stifiling
She ain't stopping me I leave her
She receive a goodbye, and I would try, hit some beaver
That's because a dog is only out for a bone
After I get it I quit it leave me a-lone
Back up off me, we agreed that we won't argue
That's what you get for fuckin with, a hard crew
A group of trooper buckin shit your luck can get snatched
And utilized the crew that tries, dies
Eyes are awakened, necks are choked, I take
Extra tokes of a slpiff, and if you want it, bring it

Why don't you follow the funk (7X)
Take along

A clever one, to spin men to the surface of
Rap plateau, with crap that go, pop
I never knew men doing my music
Get confused with, used shit, and crews bit
But they get the butter spread over bread
What it said, is we made the dough, so go ahead
Damn!  Damn I am, I stop a flow
Before I go, why don't you tell me who wit me, no
Subliminal, fin to go, low low low
And then I send a flow, to the Joe, who don't know
Mr. Nope I'll turn a hoe down in her drawers
Butt men I'm cutting flows short, like menopause
Then I cause mass confusion as you're choosing
Breakbeats that are broken, from too much using
Who's in effect, bruising the neck
Of a fly G, I get in more dips than corn chips
I scorn lips, the warning is the keen idealist
Cause I feel this threat coming

Why don't you follow the funk (7X)
Tag along

The funk rebel, will rebel and tell and
Spit shit to the click of a metronome
And get a better tone, hyper letter mon
Get a hit or two, from Domino I'ma go find a binder
And combine the mind to rearrange the strange
And flip a dip like a reciprocal
Get the goe, because you know the choice is upon me
John be, similar to Fonzie
Thumbs up, and they comes up to ask the
Ask for the slow flow that's smooth with movin faster

Vital to the right I'll make men ache when
they try to step, but charlatans are within
the range of danger, which keeps me callin
friends I meets more fake fools than real ones
But it takes clues and hits to make moves with sense
And since I'm-a rhy-mer, I need to take time to
give niggaz reminders
Who's the best, confuse the rest
Abuse crews with the news they paid dues to my death
The defter, slept on, long enough
So now I pissed the stronger stuff
and break out a bomb to puff
Wrong!  You can't hit, I lit it
Get it, nope, because you, counter-feited, dope
I hate fake guys and you make eyes follow with you

all up to my ingenuity, you will be

beaten until inanity

Wiz niggaz are jealous
But I fight what you bend with teeth
so you can see if you can dig the G-are-O-O-V-E-S

For cypher a few the sneak-iest
When kids want to fade me, great
But behold I got Seoul like the Olympics in eighty-eight
So ladies wait for the coming of the He-Men
You're on my nuts or that's how it's se-men
The mastermind is never apprehended
I screw the ruler, to fool the joker, and going up
like the smoke of a phattie, add me
to the shitlist, cause I be that
I know you see that, we phat
Livin larger than life
I be the Zenith, clean with, mean stuff

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho

I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic

Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin

But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin

Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it

Your shit's dead,
You gets fed
To the alligators lurking in the moat,
Peep what I wrote,
You bit so hard, I though your shit was a quote.
But still I'm taxing, axing the competition,
And any wack men, I stomp & dis 'em
Easily.
And you can feel the pressure, plus
When I bust MCs'll be
Trampling eachother trying to exit,
When I flex it,
The way I wreck shit is not unexpected.
Niggaz just lose when I choose
The best crews of MCs,
And turn 'em into refugees.
I slaughter a lotta MCs that are the
?Styles I compiles?, and cut 'em up like ?vows?.
Think to yourself I write the shit
So you can bite the shit,
And I'll know, despite you get props.

Enough with this wackness,
Enough is my ?check?,
Enough with these motherfuckers biting DAS EFX.

And that's for real, my flow still
Is everlasting, niggaz forever blasting

Will be exposed to foes, and everyone will feel fright.
And you'll run and tell your man, ""Yo, peep this twist,

I thought I had competition but they really wasn't.
Was it an ill you sion,
the way my bug shit seemed to bruise men?
Yo, I kill 'em with my weak raps.
You heard Casual's new shit?  
Man, you need to peep that.
Super EP, 
we treat the trooper to.  
There be no nigga alive I can't beat,
but Snupe find me, 
and who'll try me,
I'll stomp ya.
T-more said, ""Casual's a monster.""
I use my mutant powers on niggas shootin' sour rhymes.
Hiero it's our time,
so start to panic, cause doper there is.
Niggas perish tryin' to compare their's to this weak shit,
but it really ain't happenin'.  I start slappin' men, 
tell 'em I'm the best and they react with friends.

[CHORUS:]
""This is how we rip shit. (repeat)""

Incorrect, when you wreck rhymes,
then respect you collect all the time.
I'm your mentor sent for your entertainment.
Kid, you'll get your brain kicked,
stop tryin' to do that strange shit.
I'm 
rockin mics like cocaine dime
when you jock you slow-brain,
I muster strength to bust ya with,
bust your riff, that's a no-no.
Yo peep my promo, 
see how the flow go.
Surprise, 
I chastise and devise
a flow you despise,
I'm the assaulter 
who'll alter your brain
when I clipped your sensory nerves
we fence to be heard.
Bubbling buffoons get bombarded,
but they don't come hard with 
beats, besides that blundering bulllshit.
I pull kids back, I'm snatchin' 
progress, catchin' calamity, 
the famine G's, the ones you not matchin'.
And that's on the real, I repeal steel 
for any contendant 
I send it,
because I intended to wreck shit, 
collect clits
and disrespect kids.  
Then I'm headed for the exit.

[CHORUS:]
""This is how we rip shit.  (several times)""

From my standpoint,
I can point and pick you out,
kick you out, 
you slick, 
you doubt my skills,
where he stood he lies still, 
decayin'.  
These guys ain't playin'
when we tries to slay men.
Leave or receive the cleaver
that'll relieve you of your life.
Battle me and that'll be your downfall.
I surround all MC pests with the best 
skills.  
And still you do not be fresh.  
We testmicrophones with prolificness,
and if it's a doozy, 
well 
I shouldn't be choosy.
Just, ripping at will, 
I'm stripping the skill
off the run of the mill MC.
My whole goal 
is to control your brain.
I take the flimsy, 
and make them practice
so they come back with some harder shit,
try to follow the flow 
and see how hard it gets.

Casual,"Verse One:

Start with the boom!!!
That's the sound from the stuff that we, puff
It's magic I'm draggin a foe to doom
And still refrain from being blunt
The tough get snuffed for being, lame
We men claim to be all that
Call back, I'll get wit cha
All act fat, frontin they really are close to me
But I'm prone to roast a poster like I'm supposed to be
toast of the, and only me
Put your cups together, for the clever
Competition I'm just here with no limits
Cause I collapse your sad scraps like Nimitz
Once I get in it, I'll put, my soul in
I believe I deceive just to leave your ears swollen
Stolen styles are booty to me
Removin smooth men ain't no duty to me
Booty I could be but I don't flex
The brother with flwows goes up, in more hoes than Kotex
I got ya, like Joe Tex, go checks ya glossary
Cause I gots ta be
The bombed ass, supreme vocalist
I cream folks with this versafication signed Cas

Verse Two:

Check it out
When it comes to one two then shit men get
Offended, guns do, amend your mindstate
Wait I'm the buzz aight now hit this
Aim your aarow and there go your fitness
With this, flow, the swit-est, know
Yo, get this, flow
Fast-est, Cas is never hittin ashes
Gettin clever, as this
Genius, clean diss, try to get a fiend it's
going to cost you
You lost to, the master, at last the
Mass can peek the hard shit, in a, Jeep
Or whatever you hear me though
Whether Walkman or stereo
People want to hear me flow
So I kicks one, tricks one
Clones are known to break a brother bad
But all is foul
So now I think I, need a rest from
Wandering and start pondering John within
And send a message to the best when
You switch from rags to rags",Thoughts of the Thoughtful,1994
Casual,"Once upon John thinking on this
MC's just don't know
That the best will never contest my flow
Hieroglyphics the fly bros rip shit for ya
And watch you stumble as I kicks it
I blow ya, away
Like a sailboat, you fail quote some of my shit
to try and get props
But no, they got butt flow
What bro
Can handle the pressure from my gut blow
I appear as a foundation, laced in your face
That there will be no replacin
So trace your tracks or face the mack
'cause I got your girlfriend and ain't no takin her back
Word
I got it like that, so if you strike back
Steal, or don't say shit
I play with brains
Your thought train is often hijacked and rearranged
We became the fly macks

It's like that, 'cause we got it like that (8X)

What a little way to express the anger
Ya done pressed the stranger, danger
Might change a wrong to right
Yet a song I write will shed new light as you fight
And fuss with us so we must discuss
Busting your brain right open
And you strain I'm hoping
Enquiring minds turn out dope men, but the potion
Was not potent enough to fade the master yet
Since you have no kryptonite, I get to rip the mic
I flip like side be	, hit a comp wield and tear apart
we'll be-havin babboon
They'll be cravin the tunes
Sooner than the Sun Times on a new day
But who they, I got a bobby pin, so I can rob you men
And be driver, of how I come, with my gum
slander, and demand a man to think
'cause I can stop and wait, while others contemplate
the theories and when they hear these the fear beez
tremendous, but I won't amend this, endless
time is spent to rhyme, when I'm lit
Get a creative urge, then I sit
And muster clusters of creation we placed in
your face when I bust you

Get a load of this MC, and that MC
I guess the G does not possess the recipe
You're stale men fell when
inferior complexes of when John flexes
vexes the, competition often stop and listen
in all men men saught in, raw
I bet your best to play to crave the savior
Never let the sweat be seen against me fiending
for an inkling when, the sin retreat
before the score is scuffed, you flunk again
I recommend that you step, or I deck your chin
then I grin cause you slept, you kept your
Face placed in the spot from, first to last
Now listen up as Cas come burst that ass
Basically, your crew stunk
Here's your grade chump, you flunked

Chorus:

Like that and uh, MC's just flunked (4X)

Verse Two:

It's vital how I pull tricks up off my jock
Sticks and stones breakbeats and bones
make fleets of clones, drop
Sway as I say an essay, will impress a critic
Critic the way I bring a flow, get it
I'm the dopest, admit it
Regurgitate when you bit it
Ex-Lax the skills of a poet that's the shit
and he know it, I swat em seek em out, and close in-
-tro blows internally damaging men pos-ing
I suppose thin tracks are always wack
It all pays back when you stays fat
Like that and uh, like this and uh
This man'll, show you how to flow, dope
Simply stating my standpoint on the, spunk
Basically, you flunked

Chorus Two:

Like that, the competition, they just flunked (4x)

Verse Three:

It's curtains, the way to adjust, must just be
bearing with the tearing and ripping
that I'm inflicting, from where the proper shit
of my begin when, tricks lead your saliva
is deep in my dick, clean I need a remedy from men that be
All into me, they might fall into the abyss
As I twist these melodies
Hella MC's seize these fellas be
prolific, with it, all intact
Keep in touch even though I'm only callin back
wack, you're week-er than seven days
You should find a way to bring a weaker thought like crime pays
I simply the peak in rhyme divinity when it be
up to me, for the funk
Higher like this, higher like that
I got your brain again, you flunked

O tal do samba sincopado
Só não dá pra cantar mesmo
É vendo o sol nascer quadrado

Or maybe tomorrow when we ride the breeze of steel pins
It's never as easy as I remember
Burn everything that bears my name
And let me drift away from you
Forget those nights of twisted obsessions and bloody tears
And these scars of serial killer lust
It's those words I wrote to you that scream in disbelief
A wayward glance and a forgotten smile
I've seen this paradise die before

Walking between our end and the crashing surf
My regrets disappear with the cherubs
Unbind my hands from razor wire guilt
This drowning man sees what burns behind your eyes
Watch me grow and wither in those dreams of yours
Sleep tight and awaken to my absence

And I don't think I ever will",Mona Lisa,1988

Still a cat's the only cat

Who wants to dig a long-haired gig stuff like that?

Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
""Bitch, play with your mama. 'Cause I'm not your toy.""
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample

We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you

I think we should give them the murder treatment

They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)

Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, why'all can't even talk
why'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit

Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
""You paid now, been awhile since you came around.""
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib

Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate

For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'

I should have wrote you a song
Not healing well
All of these splintering ends

How dare you bring this up to me?
It took me years and years to leave
I spent my time pretending
Fight, survive, repress and bury
Somewhere within me are the words I saved

Thank you, I owe you something
So I will be honest
And tell you just how you made me feel

I tried to say I'm sorry
You never heard it from me
Born in this place
I'm sick of feeling guilty

Read in me anything you want
Assume that I am still distraught
As long as we're re-living

Lie, forgive, move out and bury
Where were you when I killed myself last year?
I'm making new memories without the horror
I'm begging you, let this story end

Fight, survive, regress and bury
Where were you when I killed myself last year?

Cat Power,"Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I’d ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don’t talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape

I know I can’t escape
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end

Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she’s talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
An’ he just smoked my eyelids
An’ punched my cigarette”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end

Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about how
Badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he’d lost control
When I speed built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing ev’ryone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
An’ me, I nearly got busted
An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, is this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I whispered and said, “Not even you can hide
You see, you’re just like me
I hope you’re satisfied”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
An’ like a fool I mixed them
An’ it strangled up my mind
An’ now people just get uglier
An’ I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

And when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’neath her Panamanian moon
An’ I say, “Aw come on now
You know you knew about my debutante”
An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
An’ here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Let me tell you a story about black
The one memory and the one who threw it right back
He was down, so I took a ride
He moved the westway out of there
So I took his advice
Oh, two seconds flat
If I'd have know he woulda treated me like that
Whoa oh, two seconds flat
How was I to know he woulda done me like that?

He had an empty gaze
In his eyes, like a bear
Took me firmly
I threw the coat away just like a foxy set
Oh whoa, who's lookin' at ya?
Who was a good kid when God was lookin' after ya?
Wow oh, who'll make it through?
How was I to know, he woulda done this to you?

He made his move, and I was down all along
I kept asking to come up for luck
I would take and he would turn and
Wait, let me catch my breath
That's black if you can catch him with it
I was someone who believed in sin
He said, I think I know just who that is

Whoa oh, who's lookin' at ya?
Who was a good kid when God was lookin' after ya?
Whoa oh, who'll make it through?
How was I to know, he woulda done this to you?

Dead man now, once was a friend
Ran all the way upstairs just to make my defense
Threw me in the bath, with ice and a slab
Can of coke, down my throat
Almost his whole hand went in
First I was amused, closest to death I'd ever been
When the white light went away
I knew death was setting in
If I knew, I would tell ya
To keep trouble off, I tell ya
You're the next one to get
Left with this story, that's when you go mad
That's black

When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning
Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know
This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time

Back on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel

A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too

Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me
Is this a Eucharistic dove
'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear
But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place

Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel.
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel
I made the cabin door, the pilot turned around
He said we're Venus bound
Oh please take me home
After all I'm only human and the Earth is where I belong
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face

Cat Stevens,"Once she came into my room, feathered hat an' all
Wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders
Two eyes like lights, milky marble whites looking up at me
Looking for a way, Moons in an endless day

All I knew was with her then, no couldn't see the time
As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet
How was I to wonder why or even question this
Underneath her her kiss I was so unguarded
Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

She was so much younger then, wild like the wind
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country
but deep beneath her curls,
Beneath this misty pearl, there was more to see

She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

Come let us drink again, before the second show
I want you so to know there's no bridge between us
All those gates have opened now, and through the light has shone
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy",Sweet Scarlet,1972

And seven evening stars 
Dance through the window 
Of her universal house

Lies humming in your soul 
So patiently awaiting 
For your ears to behold 

She ripples on the water 
Leaves diamonds on the shore 
And fish from every distance 
Watch her ocean cellar door 
Her breath a warm fire 
In every lovers heart 
A mistress to magicians 
And a dancer to the gods 
And a dancer to the gods 

Her clothes are made of rainbows 
And twenty thousand tears 
Shine through the spaces 
Of her golden ochre hair

And on my life I swear 
My conscience will I follow you forever

Me and your mum on the night
Oh Lord. 
We met

I was on the road again
She was in C79
She was a junkie then
And I was having a good time
Back on the road again

Oh momma I was on the road again
Back in suite 79
I'll never never forget
I'll never forget that time

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody 
I've got some money cause I just got paid

If I could meet 'em I could get 'em 
But as yet I haven't met 'em 
That's how I'm in the state I'm in

He had a sister who looked just fine 
Instead of being my deliverance 
She had a strange resemblance 
To a cat named Frankenstein

When he don't know his way around 
If I don't find me a honey 
To help me spend my money

For many days,
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place.

Cat Stevens,"It was a cold day in London
Dark clouds rumbling
Grabbed the yellow pages under the bed
I noticed an ad, it said

'Indian summer', '10 days of wonder'
'Paradise is yours for £50'
I thought to myself that's it

Told the wife to pack the bag
Forget about the plans we had
We're going east instead
She looked at me and shakes her head

I said, ""Oh now, baby
I know it sounds crazy
But this may be the only chance we get
We only get one life to live""

So we grabbed the kids
And some body lotion
And we went to the middle of the
Indian Ocean

Our guide was there to meet us
'Welcome' sign to greet us
Ten porters stood up like a wall
Carried our bags to the hall

The custom man smiled to me
Begs so politely
""Tell me, sir, have you any more?""
I looked at him and said, ""That's all""

They drove us to the beach house
I said, ""Is this all ours?""
They nodded and rolled out the bed
I turned to my wife and said

""Ooh now honey, I guess it's still sunny
Let's all go down for a dip
Before the sun sets""

Suddenly I gazed up
Upon the rising wave
I saw the sea drawn from the sand
I grabbed the wife and kids and ran

""Please God, save us
Please don't blame us
For this is the only life we have
We'll make it up if we were bad""

The wave was a-pounding as we
Scrambled up the mountain
No one even dared to turn their head
Just one slip and you're dead

As the waves were dying
A child was crying
Searching for her mum and dad
A thin dress was all she had

She held us tight
We looked far and wide
But nothing there
There was nothing left
We all broke down and wept

Then came the morning
A new year was born
The girl had been with us all night
My wife looked down at her and sighed

""Oh my darling, it's suddenly dawning
But just take a look at those eyes
She must be paradise""",Indian Ocean,2005

Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the world

Like the first dewfall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass

Mine is the morning
Born of the one light Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise ev'ry morning

People stood and stared then closed their doors as he passed
He strolled the empty street, kids banged on tin cans
Then the panting dogs began to bark as the roadsinger sang

Where do you go? Where do you go when hearts are closed?
When a friend becomes a stranger nobody wants to know
Where do you go? Where do you go when the world turns dark?
And the light of truth is blown out and the roads are blocked

He stopped by a stall between the barrels and sacks
A child's face peeped out and gave a smile and ran back
Behind a misty glass on a windowpane
A little finger drew a perfect heart and a name

Where do you go? Where do you go in a world filled with fright?
Only a song to warm you through the night
Where do you go? Where do you go after lies are told?
And the light of truth is blown out and the night is cold

Roadsinger rode on to another land
Though the people spoke a different tongue it understand
They showed him how to share and took him by the hand
Showed him the path to heaven through the desert sand

In a world filled with hatred, tears
Where do you go? Where do you go if no one cares?

We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star

Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on

And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love

Every rose has its thorn, yes, it does

Listen to my favorite song
Playin' on the radio
Hear the DJ say
Love's a game of easy come and easy go

But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess

Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

Though I could have saved our love that night
If I'd know what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways

And now I, I hear you've found someone new
And I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Catch 22,"Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

I can feel the world’s desire as its heart is set afire
Let it burn as it beats and we’ll never be defeated
If we say that it will happen and we know that it will happen
It'll happen just the same and we’ll be here to lead it

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

If the government can’t fight it, they will only try to hide it
But we’re looking in their eyes through their moderate disguises
Let the new will of the people overcome this evil
The stage is set for battle as the curtain slowly rises

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Anyone could be another flower on the wall
Stay true to principle and give your all for all

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Catch 22,"A hero was born of a movement for the not so distant past,
He and others like him felt the world was changing fast,
So they embarked on a journey with their very best intentions,
And thought that what began with them would never find an end.

Ready set go it's easy you know,
It's easy to get wrapped up in the madness,
Ready or not it's all that they go,
and so it goes

Suspend your disbelief in revolution,
Their solutions were a way for them to change the world they lived in
The rich stay rich, the poor got even poorer
And the world engulfed in war only added to the horror

Unlike the more moderated movements that proceeded theirs,
They were absolutely unconcerned with splitting heads,
They fought for the rights and belief that they might even change the human race,
But global revolution never seemed to show its face

Ready set go it's easy you know,
It's easy to get wrapped up in the madness,
Ready or not it's all that they go,

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""

Caterina Valente,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Caterina Valente,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesiÂ­ meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesiÂ­

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesiÂ­

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?

And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?",Frenesi,2006

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Jumping out the nest to catch some bird food
Clutch so intense that the knuckles turn blue

Check horizons, read the flight plan
Spread the lifespan
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps
We only try to get free from the spider's web
Gotta murder all the messing around
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down
With a spot like now, my shot, my chance
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants

Break loose, raise roof when the kick drops
They flew, straight through, no pit stops
Lift off with your head in the clouds
Or get lost in the rest of the crowd

Slash rap notable
Slash mic on the ? still controlling you
I'm rarely candid, my view panoramic
My eyes wide shut, if not one, I'm holding two
I'm packing double, getting up too early
I'm actually trouble, kind of acting 7: 30
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly
But running on my work that says ""Ev I better hurry""
I'd rather worry death than being pushed in the line
Still a perfect ?, never late when I fly
Epic ? so this time when I rhyme
Not an ounce of death dying, stay late to the sky
Late for my prime, something that was shaped by design
I been running while the others hurt from racing a line
Making it great coincides with making it mine
Coincides with the hate that I'm making in signs
Let me start from the beginning, I rewind to the top
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the ?
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion
Coasting in between the wings of this flowing

From a chicken wire frame
And a house of wax
To a rocket exploding into a cloud of bats

Sitting a ?

Sail away with the sun

Will it come to pass?
Need the strength to carry on
Must forget the past...

Reflecting a transparent face
Just nothingless is recognised

Here I stand ? all alone
Before a cross my concience pleads yesterday
A thorn embraced as the future slowly bleads
Awaken now, bury the past,
Put to rest, no longer grieve
Chase the light, pass the gates
Leave this graveyard of lost dream.

Our sin is rebellion, in black arts crowned 

3 covens of 39 
In 1591 that night performed a rite 
A grand Sabbath with one aim in sight 
To destroy the king of England 

Create a storm, whilst overseas he sails 
To bring his Danish bride to these Isles 
They christened a cat in his name; 
Threw it in a pond, no shame 
A tempest was aroused, who should he blame 

Hunt down those Witches, confess or die 
Sink or swim, they're guilty – let's hang ‘em high 

3 covens of 39 
In 1591 that night performed a rite 
A grand Sabbath with one aim in sight 
To destroy the king of England 

Witchcraft spreading all around this Christian land 
Find them; burn them to the ground 
Their souls condemned 

Their ill fated curse failed so the king held trial 
The first great persecution of the British Isles 
An imp sucks a spinster's nipple 
A hare drains milk from cattle 
A clergy fornicate at a black dog's ball 

Pierce flesh with needles three inches in 
If they scream they're guilty, guilty as sin 

3 covens slaughtered that night 
39 crucified, burned and hanged alive 
Interrogated at our first witch trials 
Sentenced by the king of England

Cathedral,"Under the war-torn sodden skies 
Bleeding axes anguished lies 
Fight upon an earth that died 
Raped by corporate scythe 
Streets are red, Sun turned to grey 
Nature's beauty has decayed 
Swans lay dead on empty lakes 
Love oh man - Forsakes 

Fear his wrath as mans blood flows 
Innocence now no-one knows 
Rites of virtue we've disposed 
Heaven's doors solemnly closed 
Cities crumbled to the ground 
Deformed crosses mark the land 
Carnage lingers all around 
No refuge for the damned 

[Chorus] 
Eyes of death, look upon this earth 
Destroyed by mankind's curse 
Retribution, mutilation, desecrate, avenge 

Oppressive tyrants to him fall 
One by one he reaps their soul 
Tearing death from their control 
Elated by the rising toll 
Slaying masters and their laws 
Who destroyed our world with force 
Oro gives unto the poor swords 
To join him in this war 

[Chorus] 

Battlefield of charnel air 
Land, sea, earth now laid bare 
Morgue of solitude we share 
Shown no mercy for our prayers 
Laying down his bloody sword 
Oro leaves us our reward 
Silent vacuum, endless floor 
- Gone forever more 

[Chorus]

Cathedral,"In the garden of creation stands a skeletal tree
Hanging from its branches afterbirth of Adam & Eve
Blossomed in mutation rotted through centuries
Tortured minds heinous crimes plague God's family

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left -- on the tree of life & death

Slug like dead existence, our fetid hunger breeds
Master of future decay -- sowed his deadly seed
Roots of evil ate away our fruits of destiny
Thorns of human nature stabbed hearts of the free

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left -- on the tree of life & death

Ogun, Malunga, Kalumba,
Kinta, Oloron, Mukuru

Original sin

In the garden of existence,
Hanging from temptation's tree
A carnival of mutations
Growing from man's fated seed

Leza, Marasu, Chiuta
Nzumbi, Osawa, Zanahary

God's offspring ate the apple creating lust, envy
Sucking, puking leeches, a catastrophe of greed
Garden of temptation lured by serpent's creed
Moral desolation, man eternally diseased

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left -- on the tree of life & death

Cathedral,"Riding on the flames of death Into this last night fear
relents As we race through skies upon Azrael's wings
He has com to set us free from this earthbound misery
Father of macabre you possess the key To heavens
black galactic morgue Chosen few seek your reward In
solitude, perpetual silence Cosmic womb, eteral solace
Embracing cosmic mysteries To worlds below he's
sent a wreath Elated black angel; our requiem he sings
As tears of Nebula fill black holes Drowing galaxies
of lost souls We continue our ascent to heavens low
No turning back from galactic morgue Chosen few
find your reward In solitude, perpetual silence Cosmic
womb, eternal solace Colossal grave of shadows,
extinction of mankind Eternal morgue or sorrows, no beauty
left behind Void of shadows, man's colossal grave
Ball of ash to zero fades Nothing left to mourn, all
has died, ever born Barren voyage static drone Stark
oblivion reigns so cold Dropped out of existence, we've
found our hmoe In heaven's black galactic morgue
Chosen few have found our reward In solitude,
perpetual silence Cosmic womb, eternal solace

Catherina Valente & Catherine Michel,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were,2002
