Waka Flocka Flame,"Grove Grove Street, flocka!

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin' that's why the bad hoes jockin'

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk,
Rollin' a lot I'm trying to get fucked up

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

I step in the club, rollin' on that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying be quiet
My bread startin' a riot, your girl getting excited
Hold on wanna try it, I'm like why not try it
My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Club going stupid, when I oh lets do it
Chu ain't gotta chew it, juking and she moving
Grove street villain nigga who you killin'?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jackson's to the ceiling that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm rollin'
Throwing up the mean bread
Now I'm bout to meet her in the club with a heater

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin' that's why the bad hoes jockin

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk,
Rollin' a lot I'm trying to get fucked up

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

A party ain't a party til I walk in it
Lime green flap match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kinda tinted
Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinnin'
I'm rollin' like a mothafucka I'm a roll out in this motherfucker
I'ma roscoe dash it I'ma bout to show out in this mothafucka
My jewelry game on frost about to snow out in this mothafucka
Ay flocka get them burners lets pull out in this mothafucka
Ay mothafucka what the hell is you rockin' for run up on me and my squad
No that shouldn't be an option so
Somebody betta let you know I suggest that you let it go
This is grove street party safe niggas hit the exit door

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin' that's why the bad hoes jockin'

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk,
Rollin' a lot I'm trying to get fucked up

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

Rollin on them leaves, you can do the lean
Blowing on that loud perp, pass that bobby brown back
The hood got my fucking back, the streets I'm not duckin' that
Please step the fuck back, grove street yes we are back
Hood plus I'm nigger rich, every ghetto feeling this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist,
100 on my neck iced out for my respect
20 fucking 10 I'ma blow the whole check
In the club flex, after party flex,
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket I'ma spend it all,
When a nigga die they gon' say shawty raw

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin' that's why the bad hoes jockin'

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk,
Rollin' a lot I'm trying to get fucked up

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party",Grove St. Party,2010

Bitches all in her business
Pink on the back of her boy shorts
Bought everything she own
Love it when she smile and moan
Encore how she groan
Ask around the hood, she known
One of a type she can't be cloned
""No hands"" for her ring tone
""Hard in the paint"" her theme song
That's my gutta chick
Man I love that bitch
The way she look and moan
When she taking it
And don't mind McDonald's
Ain't no bougie bitch

Breakfast on the table,
One rolled up
Sprayed upon the table

And under it was nothing
I'm so curious, it's serious,
My car so fast and furious
But she'll drive a man delirious
I hope all y'all hearing this
She's got swag of a top model
Curves like a coke bottle
She know I go full throttle
I'm walking with a slight wobble
Got choppas like I'm Big Papa
I'm Big Gucci, you a cock blocker
These True Religion not the knock off
My camera chain is an eye problem
I'm a stunt stunt a bill on a half a mil'
Ice crem Gucci Mane, can I live?
Chick knows I got a rubber dick
You know what gone in 60 secs is?

Hide behind my feelings, like a game of hide & seek
I wanted you badly, you looked at me so sadly
I'm mounting my eyes, with this could never be
'cause I like her and you're like me

So can't you see, I'm open for a change
This was never easy, and it's never been so strange
To fall for that girl, that falls for all the girls 
It's just not right
Welcome to the after school special of my life

If we were together, I'd make your heart surrender
No more watching girls go by, I'd make her stay at home
I'd wear what you told me, as long as you will hold me
Like a man, and understand, that this is not impossible

[chorus]

[bridge:]
This got so complicated, common interest separate
The fine print on the label of your life is never told
One shot missed and two got wasted
Three's a charm but hesitating,
I will never mean to you what you will mean to me

Wakeman & Cousins,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Wal Berg Orchestra,"La Biguine à Bango

Connaissez-vous la Martinique ?
Connais-tu là-bas le Bango ?
Dès qu'il entend jolie musique
Le voilà debout tout de go
Pour danser avec demoiselle,
Ah, c'est un galant damoiseau,
Demoiselle, tu as des ailes,
Quand tu fais Biguine à Bango…

Refrain

Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango
Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango !
La nuit à Bango !

La nuit et le jour on ne pense
Qu'à danser Biguine à Bango,
Jeunes filles vont dans la danse,
Les mamis attendent là-haut.
En buvant avec les nourrices
Elles chantent sous leurs chapeaux :
« Mami, Mami, c'est un délice,
Quand on fait Biguine à Bango. » (Refrain)

Le mariage c'est une fête
Où l'on boit du lait de coco
Et lorsque la nuit est complète,
Papi, mami, s'en vont bientôt.
Alors tous deux vite on commence
Les caresses dans le dodo,
On recule et puis on avance,
Et puis c'est… Biguine à Bango ! (Refrain)

Bango, Bango a des p'tits frères
Des p'tit's sœurs qui dans'nt à Paris
À Paris aussi on sait faire
La Biguine comme au pays.
Et tout comme à la Martinique,
Demoisell's ont le ventre gros,
On travaill’ pour la République
Quand on fait Biguine à Bango ! (Refrain)",La Biguine à Bango,1996

En écoutant hurler la plainte des frimas...

Alors tu reviendras, mais je serai parti...

Et pour toi, sans effort, mes yeux seront ouverts

Wal-Berg & His Orchestra,"C'est un jardin extraordinaire:
Il y a des canards qui parlent anglais.
Je leur donne du pain, ils remuent leur derrière
En me disant ""Thank you very much, Monsieur Trenet"".
On y voit aussi des statues
Qui se tiennent tranquilles tout le jour, dit-on
Mais moi, je sais que, dès la nuit venue,
Elles s'en vont danser sur le gazon.
Papa, c'est un jardin extraordinaire
Il y a des oiseaux qui tiennent un buffet.
Ils vendent du grain, des petits morceaux de gruyère.
Comme clients ils ont Monsieur le maire et le Sous-Préfet.

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville maussade
Où les touristes s'ennuient au fond de leurs autocars,
Il fallait bien trouver un lieu pour la promenade.
J'avoue que ce samedi-là je suis entré par hasard
Dans, dans, dans

Un jardin extraordinaire,
Loin des noirs buildings et des passages cloutés.
Y avait un bal que donnaient des primevères.
Dans un coin de verdure, les petites grenouilles chantaient
Une chanson pour saluer la lune.
Dès que celle-ci parut, toute rose d'émotion,
Elles entonnèrent, je crois, la valse brune.
Une vieille chouette me dit: ""Quelle distraction!""
Maman, dans ce jardin extraordinaire,
Je vis soudain passer la plus belle des filles.
Elle vint près de moi, et là me dit sans manières:
""Vous me plaisez beaucoup, j'aime les hommes dont les yeux brillent!""

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville perverse,
Une gentille amourette, un petit flirt de vingt ans
Qui me fasse oublier que l'amour est un commerce
Dans les bars de la cité,
Oui, mais oui mais pas dans
Dans, dans, dans

Mon jardin extraordinaire.
Un ange du Bizarre, un agent nous dit
""Étendez-vous sur la verte bruyère,
Je vous jouerai du luth pendant que vous serez réunis.""
Cet agent était un grand poète
Mais nous préférions, Artémise et moi,
La douceur d'une couchette secrète
Qu'elle me fit découvrir au fond du bois.
Pour ceux qui veulent savoir où le jardin se trouve,
Il est, vous le voyez, au cœur de ma chanson.
J'y vole parfois quand un chagrin m'éprouve.

Et l'hôtesse la plus exquise

On y côtoie le monde entier
Des diplomates et dse poètes
Mais les mondanités passées
Libérée de ton enveloppe
Tu deviens dans l'intimité
La plus formidable salope
Qu'une mere n'ait enfantée

Je sais que vous, je sais que tu

Jamais vos yeux ne vous trahissent
S'ils croisent un instant les miens
A l'heure où votre époux en scène
Joue de Musset subventionné
Vous venez jusqu'à mon septième
Ciel et enfer de nos pechés
Et sur mon lit, nue et offerte
Délaissant tes airs de statue
Tu te révèles plus experte
Qu'une sirène de la rue

Je sais que vous, je sais que tu
Vous que j'admire

Je sais que vous, je sais que tu

Toi seize avec tout à apprendre
Quand je t’écrivais des poèmes
Où tout rimait avec je t’aime
Tu étais encore écolière
C’était un peu avant la guerre

A l’orée de l’adolescence
Le désir bouscule l’enfance
Dans l’herbe d’un printemps précoce
On s’est uni en simples noces
Notre témoin fut dieu le père
C’était un peu avant la guerre

Mais au vent  des amours fautives
Ce qui doit arriver arrive
Ta taille prit de l’importance
On nous maria de toute urgence
Mais un jour les choses changèrent
C’était un peu avant la guerre

Un uniforme sans retouche
Un fusil et quatre cartouches
Les champs brûlés de la retraite
Les barbelés de la défaite
Quelque part en terre étrangère
Je nous revois avant la guerre

Où sont les seize ans de ta vie
Et les printemps de nos folies
Quand pour nous s’ouvraient sur la chance
Les portes d’or de l’insouciance
Et que tout brillait de lumière
Avant la nuit, avant la guerre
Avant la guerre",Avant la Guerre,1995
Waldir Calmon,"Let me tell of a time when the world was in rhyme
With the sound of our laughter
Montmartre hanged with flowers for far-forgotten hours
Of hunger and of love

Unaware in our youth of the sobering truth
Of the years that came after
We laughed at common men for we were heroes then
And heaven smiled above

La boheme, la boheme
Poor hungry you, poor hungry me
La boheme, la boheme
See the old world that could not see

All those innocent hearts who imagined their arts
Could be casually mastered
I miss them every one
For the sands of time have run away for each and all

For it seems that our schemes were impossible dreams
That could never have lasted
For when we woke at last the big parade had passed
And spring had gone its way

La boheme, la boheme
Someone to care, someone to mind
La boheme, la boheme
We were in love and love is blind

Now and then I return and the memories burn
With a bittersweet aching
I climb the same old stairs
But no-one longer cares

And there's no-one to greet in the streets where we walked
And the bars where we talked of a world we were making
I stand upon that hill until I drink my fill
Then leave it all behind

La boheme, la boheme
Moments of joy, moments of pain
La boheme, la boheme
Nothing can bring them back again",La Bohème,1995

Waldir Calmon,"Un beau matin je sais que je m’éveillerai
Différemment de tous les autres jours
Et mon cœur délivré enfin de notre amour
Et pourtant, et pourtant
Sans un remords, sans un regret je partirai
Droit devant moi sans espoir de retour
Loin des yeux loin du cœur j’oublierai pour toujours
Et ton cœur et tes bras
Et ta voix
Mon amour

Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant

J’arracherai sans une larme, sans un cri
Les liens secrets qui déchirent ma peau
Me libérant de toi pour trouver le repos
Et pourtant, et pourtant
Je marcherai vers d’autres cieux, d’autres pays
En oubliant ta cruelle froideur

Que je parte à jamais pour échapper à toi
Dans d’autres bras quand j'oublirai jusqu’à ton nom
Quand je pourrai repenser l’avenir

Waldir Calmon,"Ils sont venus
Ils sont tous là
Dès qu'ils ont entendu ce cri
Elle va mourir, la mamma
Ils sont venus
Ils sont tous là
Même ceux du sud de l'Italie
Y a même Giorgio, le fils maudit
Avec des présents plein les bras
Tous les enfants jouent en silence
Autour du lit ou sur le carreau
Mais leurs jeux n'ont pas d'importance
C'est un peu leurs derniers cadeaux
A la mamma, a la mamma

On la réchauffe de baisers
On lui remonte ses oreillers

Dont la statue est sur la place

En lui chantant Ave Maria

Autour de toi, toi la mamma
Y a tant de larmes et de sourires
A travers toi, toi la mamma

Et tous les hommes ont eu si chaud
Sur les chemins de grand soleil
Elle va mourir, la mamma
Qu'ils boivent frais le vin nouveau
Le bon vin de la bonne treille
Tandis que s'entassent pèle-mêle
Sur les bancs, foulards et chapeaux
C'est drôle on ne se sent pas triste
Près du grand lit et de l'affection
Y a même un oncle guitariste
Qui joue en faisant attention
A la mamma, a la mamma

Et les femmes se souvenant
Des chansons tristes des veillées
Elle va mourir, la mamma
Tout doucement, les yeux fermés
Chantent comme on berce un enfant
Après une bonne journée
Pour qu'il sourie en s'endormant

Waldir Calmon,"Dans le bruit familier de la boite à  la mode
Aux lueurs psychédéliques au curieux décorum
Nous découvrons assis sur des chaises incommodes
Les derniers disques pop, poussés au maximum

C'est là  qu'on s'est connu parmi ceux de notre âge
Toi vetue en Indienne et moi en col Mao
Nous revenons depuis comme en pèlerinage
Danser dans la fumée à  couper au couteau

Viens découvrons toi et moi les plaisirs démodés
Ton cœur contre mon cœur malgré les rythmes fous
Je veux sentir mon corps par ton corps épousé
Dansons joue contre joue
Dansons joue contre joue

Viens noyée dans la cohue, mais dissociés du bruit
Comme si sur la Terre il n'y avait que nous
Glissons les yeux mi-clos jusqu'au bout de la nuit
Dansons joue contre joue
Dansons joue contre joue


Sur la piste envahie c'est un spectacle rare
Les danseurs sont en transe et la musique aidant
Ils semblent sacrifier à  des rythmes barbares
Sur les airs d'aujourd'hui souvent vieux de tous temps

L'un à  l'autre étrangers bien que dansant ensemble
Les couples se démènent on dirait que pour eux
Le musique et l'amour ne font pas corps ensemble
Dans cette obscurité propice aux amoureux

Viens découvrons toi et moi les plaisirs démodés
Ton cœur contre mon cœur malgré les rythmes fous
Je veux sentir mon corps par ton corps épousé
Dansons joue contre joue
Dansons joue contre joue

Viens noyée dans la cohue, mais dissociés du bruit

Waldir Calmon,"Moi certains soirs quand je m'ennuie
Je connais un coin dans Paris
Où l'on se rencontre entre amis
Pour faire une jam

Chacun prenant son instrument
Qu'il soit à corde ou bien à vent
Laisse parler son tempérament
Pour faire une jam

Comme je ne suis pas musicien
Mais que vraiment j'aime ça
Je rythme en frappant dans mes mains et chante
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

Car quand on est dans cette ambiance
Les mots n'ont aucune importance
Le principal c'est que ça balance
Pour faire une jam

On perd en l'éclair d'un instant
La notion du lieu et du temps
Et l'on oublie ses embêtements
Pour faire une jam

C'est l'heure, l'heure de l'improvisation
Des chorus et des citations
Car on se donne avec passion
Pour faire une jam

Nos aînés ne trouvent pas normales
Ces explosions de joie
Mais au fond que fait-on de mal en chantant
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

En bras de chemise parce qu'on a chaud
On se donne à fond les yeux mi-clos
Car plus ça chauffe et mieux ça vaut
Pour faire une jam

Nos peines, nos joies, nos ivresses
Danses et rythmes se reconnaissent
Il faut la foi de la jeunesse
Pour faire une jam

La batterie roule, la basse craque
Le piano chante, les cuivres attaquent
De toutes parts les notes claquent
Pour faire une jam

Quand on a le jazz dans le sang
Et jusqu'au bout des doigts
Et que l'on est pris cent pour cent, on chante
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

Au petit jour, sur le trottoir
Les traits tirés, le teint blafard
Comme à regret on se sépare
En se disant remplis d'espoir
Salut les gars à un de ces soirs
Pour faire une jam",Pour Faire une Jam,1995
Waldir Calmon,"Que c'est triste Venise
Au temps des amours mortes
Que c'est triste Venise
Quand on ne s'aime plus

On cherche encore des mots
Mais l'ennui les emporte
On voudrait bien pleurer
Mais on ne le peut plus

Que c'est triste Venise
Lorsque les barcarolles
Ne viennent souligner
Que des silences creux

Et que le cœur se serre
En voyant les gondoles
Abriter le bonheur
Des couples amoureux

Que c'est triste Venise
Au temps des amours mortes
Que c'est triste Venise
Quand on ne s'aime plus

Les musées, les églises
Ouvrent en vain leurs portes
Inutile beauté
Devant nos yeux déçus

Que c'est triste Venise
Le soir sur la lagune
Quand on cherche une main
Que l'on ne vous tend pas

Et que l'on ironise
Devant le clair de lune
Pour tenter d'oublier
Ce qu'on ne se dit pas

Adieu tout les pigeons
Qui nous en fait escortent
Adieu Pont des Soupir
Adieu rêves perdus

Qui enjambe le ruisseau
Je regarde solitaire
Courir l'heure et couler l'eau

Que le jour meure ou se lève
Qu'il neige ou souffle le vent
Que le monde vive ou crève
Je m'en fous éperdument

Tu as mis mon coeur en croix
Ne laissant planter en moi
Que le souvenir en toi

Dans le courant de mes peines

Je dérive à corps perdu
Entre l'amour et la haine
L'amour a pris le dessus
Tu as dépecé mon âme
Simplement avec des mots
Plus effilés qu'une lame
Et mis ma vie en lambeaux

Comment échapper aux choses?
Mon coeur à ma tête ment
Le parfum mène à la rose
Dont l'épine pique au sang
Alors je reste immobile
Et ma pensée suit son cours
Je crois devenir une île
Pétrifié dans mon amour

Assis comme un enfant sage
Je regarde le ruisseau

Quand tu séchais les cours et venais le matin
Pour m'apporter ton coeur comme un bouton de rose
Rose, rose, amour de mon passé
Quand tu venais me voir dans ma chambre au grenier
Je trouvais que ta peau sentait le foin mouillé
Et quand je t'embrassais... mais ça c'est autre chose

Abhorrant le soleil mais adorant la neige

Roi des Juifs et de l'univers

Waldir Calmon,"Nous irons à  Vérone un beau jour tous les deux
Au balcon qui connut Roméo et Juliette
Puis anonymement sur leurs tombes muettes
Nous jetterons des fleurs, émus, silencieux

Nous irons à  Vérone un beau jour toi et moi
Voir la terre promise aux amours éternelles
Où mourir est plus doux que de vivre infidèle
Où le don de sa vie est un acte de joie

Un jour je serai riche et ferai des folies
Laisse-moi te conter, ferme un instant les yeux
Nous irons par la route embrasser l'Italie
Nous irons par nos cœurs frôler le merveilleux


Nous irons à  Vérone un beau jour tous les deux
Impatients, recueillis comme deux fous de gosses
En voyage d'amour, en voyage de noces
Nous irons à  Vérone et nous serons heureux

Mais ton cœur a pris froid bien avant le voyage
Il a changé de cap au mirage de l'or
Alors mon cœur perdu a déplié bagages
Et mes reves décus n'ont pas quitté le port

Le temps était clair, le monde était beau
Nous étions heureux
Y'avait des printemps meme en plein hiver

Au creux de ton lit, le ciel était bleu
Hier c'était l'espoir
Y'avait du vin blanc qui coulait à flot
Sur tous les comptoirs
Y'avait des amis aussi fous que nous
Qui venaient nous voir
Pour partager tout, le pain blanc ou noir
Mais c'était hier
Je me rappelle
C'était hier
Tu étais belle

Et moi j'étais jeune, peut-etre un peu sot
Je me croyais beau
Hier étais à nous
On dormait le jour on chantait la nuit
Et riait de tout
Plantant dans la vie nos griffes de chat
Et nos dents de loup

Et je meurs mille vies,

Pour vivre l'aventure,
En me laissant crever,

Qui coule par endroit,
Des plis à ton corsage,

Toi, mon joli péché mignon

Mille baisers sur ton corps nu

Waldir Calmon,"J'ai ouvert les yeux sur un meublé triste
Rue Monsieur Le Prince au Quartier Latin
Dans un milieu de chanteurs et d'artistes
Qu'avaient un passé, pas de lendemain
Des gens merveilleux un peu fantaisistes
Qui parlaient le russe et puis l'arménien

Si mon père était chanteur d'opérette
Nanti d'une voix que j'envie encore
Ma mère tenait l'emploi de soubrette
Et le troupe ne roulait pas sur l'or
Mais ma sœur et moi étions à la fête
Blottis dans un coin derrière un décor

Tous ces comédiens chargés de famille
Mais dont le français était hésitant
Devaient accepter pour gagner leur vie
Le premier emploi qui était vacant
Conduire un taxi ou tirer l'aiguille
Ça pouvait se faire avec un accent

Après le travail les jours de semaine
Ces acteurs frustrés répétaient longtemps
Pour le seul plaisir un soir par quinzaine
De s'offrir l'oubli des soucis d'argent
Et crever de trac en entrant en scène
Devant un public formé d'émigrants

Quand les fins de mois étaient difficiles
Quand il faisait froid, qui le pain manquait
On allait souvent honteux et fébrile
Au Mont de piété où l'on engageait
Un vieux samovar, des choses futiles
Objets du passé, auxquels on tenait

On parlait de ceux morts près du Bosphore
Buvait à la vie, buvait aux copains
Les femmes pleuraient et jusqu'aux aurores
Les hommes chantaient quelques vieux refrains
Qui venaient de loin, du fond d'un folklore
Où vivaient la mort, l'amour et le vin

Nous avions toujours des amies à table
Le peu qu'on avait on le partageait
Mes parents disaient: « Ce serait le diable
Si demain le ciel ne nous le rendait «
Ce n'est pas là geste charitable:
Ils aimaient les autres et Dieu nous aidaient

Tandis que devant poêles et casseroles
Mon père cherchait sa situation
Jour et nuit sous une lampe à pétrole
Ma mère brodait pour grande maison
Et nous avant que d'aller à l'école
Faisions le ménage et les commissions

Ainsi je grandis sans contrainte aucune
Me soûlant la nuit, travaillant le jour
Ma vie a connu diverses fortunes
J'ai frôlé la mort, j'ai trouvé l'amour
J'ai eu des enfants qui m'ont vu plus d'une
Fois me souvenir le coeur un peu lourd

Un regard trouble et malicieux
Qui veut me suggérer des choses

Des gestes faits au ralenti
Qui prennent d'affolantes poses

Moi j'ai la gorge contractée
Je reste comme hypnotisé
Tandis qu'en moi monte une fièvre
Embrasse-moi
Quand mon coeur sur écran géant
Fébrilement fait un gros plan

Où tu te révèles géniale

Pudique dans ta nudité
De tes fantasmes libérée

Quand pour moi dans un tourbillon
De feu, de chair et de passion

Waldir Calmon,"Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je caressais le temps
J'ai joué de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets qui sont restés en l'air
J'ai fondé tant d'espoirs qui se sont envolés
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant où aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le cœur mis en terre

Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je gaspillais le temps
En croyant l'arrêter
Et pour le retenir, même le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir et me suis essoufflé
Ignorant le passé, conjuguant au futur
Je précédais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde avec désinvolture
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans mais j'ai perdu mon temps
À faire des folies
Qui me laissent au fond rien de vraiment précis
Que quelques rides au front et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai gâché ma vie et mes jeunes années
Du meilleur et do pire en jetant le meilleur
J'ai figé mes sourires et j'ai glacé mes pleurs
Où sont-ils à présent?
À présent
Mes vingt ans",Hier Encore (Full Album),1999
Waldir Calmon,"Je bois pour oublier mes années d'infortune
Et cette vie commune
Avec toi mais si seul
Je bois pour me donner l'illusion que j'existe
Puisque trop égoïste
Pour me péter la gueule
Et je lève mon verre à nos cœurs en faillite
Nos illusions détruites
À ma fuite en avant
Et je trinque à l'enfer qui dans mon foie s'impose
En bouquet de cirrhose
Que j'arrose en buvant
Je bois jour après jour à tes fautes, à mes fautes
Au temps que côte à côte
Il nous faut vivre encore
Je bois à nos amours ambiguës, diaboliques
Souvent tragi-comiques
Nos silences de mort
À notre union ratée, mesquine et pitoyable
À ton corps insatiable
Roulant de lit en lit
À ce serment, prêté la main sur l'évangile
À ton ventre stérile
Qui n'eut jamais de fruit
Je bois pour échapper à ma vie insipide
Je bois jusqu'au suicide
Le dégoût, la torpeur
Je bois pour m'enivrer et vomir mes principes
Libérant de mes tripes
Ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Au bonheur avorté, à moi et mes complexes
À toi, tout feu, tout sexe
À tes nombreux amants
À ma peau boursouflée, striée de couperose
Et à la ménopause
Qui te guette au tournant
Je bois aux lois bénies de la vie conjugale
Qui de peur du scandale
Poussent à faire semblant
Je bois jusqu'à la lie, aux étreintes sommaires
Aux putes exemplaires
Aux froids accouplements
Au meilleur de la vie qui par lambeaux nous quitte
À cette cellulite
Dont ton corps se rempare
Au devoir accompli comme deux automates
Aux ennuis de prostate
Que j'aurai tôt ou tard
Je bois à en crever et peu à peu j'en crève
Comme ont crevé mes rêves
Quand l'amour m'a trahi
Je bois à m'en damner le foie comme une éponge
Car le mal qui me ronge
Est le mal de l'oubli
Je m'enivre surtout pour mieux noyer ma peine
Et conjurer la haine
Dont nous sommes la proie
Et je bois comme un trou qu'est en tout point semblable
À celui que le diable
Te fait creuser pour moi
Je bois mon Dieu, je bois
Un peu par habitude
Beaucoup de solitude
Et pour t'oublier toi
Et pour t'emmerder toi

Plus je ne peux que constater
Qu'au vent léger de mes folies

Entre les draps de la jeunesse

À l'horloge de mes faiblesses
Je n'ai pas vu le temps passer

Et d'ouverture en ouverture
Au tempo des amours pressées
J'ai dû sauter quelques mesures
Je n'ai pas vu le temps passer

Quand je rêvais les yeux ouverts
En pensant que j'avais le temps
Je n'ai pas entrepris le tiers
Des choses dont je parlais tant
Et j'ai vu s'installer l'hiver

Que tu as si souvent
Quand tu te fous du monde
Tu ne demandes pas

Si mon âme est meurtrie
Si j'ai trouvé l'oubli

De reprendre ta place et tes droits

Waldir Calmon,"Vers les docks où le poids et l'ennui 
Me courbent le dos 
Ils arrivent le ventre alourdi de fruits
Les bateaux 

Ils viennent du bout du monde 
Apportant avec eux des idées vagabondes aux reflets de ciels bleus 
De mirages 
Traînant un parfum poivré de pays inconnus 
Et d'éternels étés où l'on vit presque nus 
Sur les plages 

Moi qui n'ai connu toute ma vie 
Que le ciel du nord 
J'aimerais débarbouiller ce gris 
En virant de bord 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles 
Il me semble que la misère 
Serait moins pénible au soleil 

Dans les bars à la tombée du jour 
Avec les marins 
Quand on parle de filles et d'amour, un verre à la main 

Je perds la notion des choses et soudain ma pensée 
M'enlève et me dépose, un merveilleux été 
Sur la grève 
Où je vois tendant les bras l'amour qui comme un fou 
Court au devant de moi et je me pends au cou 
De mon rêve 

Quand les bars ferment, que les marins 
Rejoignent leur bord 
Moi je rêve encore jusqu'au matin 
Debout sur le port 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles 
Il me semble que la misère 
Serait moins pénible au soleil 

Un beau jour sur un rafiot craquant 
De la coque au pont 
Pour partir je travaillerais dans la soute à charbon 

Prenant la route qui mène à mes rêves d'enfant 
Sur des îles lointaines où rien n'est important 
Que de vivre 
Où les filles alanguies vous ravissent le cœur 
En tressant m'a-t'on dit de ces colliers de fleurs 
Qui enivrent 

Je fuirais, laissant là mon passé 
Sans aucun remords 
Sans bagage et le cœur libéré 
En chantant très fort 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles

Waldir Calmon,"J'ai mis mon complet neuf, mes souliers qui me serrent
Et je suis prêt déjà depuis pas mal de temps
Ce soir est important, car c'est l'anniversaire
Du jour où le bonheur t’avait vêtue de blanc

Mais je te sens nerveuse, au bord de la colère
Alors je ne dis rien, mieux vaut être prudent
Si je disais un mot, ton fichu caractère
M'enverrais sur les roses, et l'on perdrait du temps

Il est huit heures un quart, et tu attends la robe
Qu'on devait te livrer ce matin au plus tard
Pour comble tes cheveux au peigne se dérobent
Tout semble se liguer pour qu'on soit en retard

Si tout va de ce train, la soirée au théâtre
Et l'auteur à la mode, on s’en fera un deuil
Adieu pièce d'Anouilh, d'Anouilh, ou bien de Sartre
Je ne sais plus très bien, mais j’ai deux bons fauteuils

Bon anniversaire
Bon anniversaire

Ta robe est arrivée, enfin, et tu respires
Moi pour gagner du temps je t'aide de mon mieux
Tout semble s'arranger mais soudain c'est le pire
La fermeture s'arrête et coince au beau milieu

On s'énerve tous deux, on pousse et puis l’on tire
On s'y mêle les doigts, on y met tant d’ardeur
Que dans un bruit affreux, le tissu se déchire
Et je vois tes espoirs se transformer en pleurs

Aux environs d'onze heures, enfin te voilà prête
Mais le temps d'arriver le théâtre est fermé, viens
Allez viens, nous irons souper tous deux en tête à tête
Non, tu as le coeur gros, tu préfères rentrer

Par les rues lentement, nous marchons en silence
Tu souris, je t'embrasse, et tu souris encore
La soirée est gâchée, mais on a de la chance
Puisque nous nous aimons, l'amour est le plus fort

Du néon au néant
Elle a couru certaine
Et noyer des tourments
Et stopper la gangrène
Des outrages du temps
Avant que ne survienne
L'âge et le poids des ans
Sortie de la misère
Courageuse elle avait
Gravi comme un calvaire
Les marches du succès
De triomphe en victoire
Coeur léger ou coeur lourd
Elle avait à la gloire
Sacrifié ses amours
De la scène à la Seine
Elle a couru sans peur
Pour laisser souveraine
A ses admirateurs

L'image d'une reine
Le timbre d'une voix
Comme un chant de sirène
Pour qu'on ne l'oublie pas
Elle traînait livide
De miroir en miroir
En découvrant ses rides
Camouflées sous les fards
Sa vie lui semblait vide
Sous son air triomphal
Car la gloire est perfide
Car la gloire fait mal
De la scène à la Seine
Elle a fait sa sortie
Emportant ses migraines
Et ses traits de génies
Telle une tragédienne
Drapée dans sa folie
Elle a franchi sans peine
Les portes de la nuit
De rengaine en rengaine
Elle avait négligé
Autant qu'on s'en souvienne
Amour et vie privée
Mais à l'âge incertaine
Ou l'on compte les ans

Sans hommes et sans enfants

Retouchera sa vie
Trois colonnes à la une
Dix pages à l'intérieur

En noir et en couleur

Je me suis endormi
Elle vient me surprendre
Dans la chaleur du lit
De sa peau douce et nue
Elle réveille en moi

Sauf pour quelques fanas têtus
Le voilà parti bille en tête
Le jazz est revenu
Il avait bâti son histoire
Sans publicité superflue
Pour revivre ses jours de gloire
Le jazz est revenu

Il n'est donc pas échec et mat
Puisque aussi les jeunes se mettent
Au scat
Bien des musicos réapprennent
A jouer cool et détendu

Il a connu les controverses

Car les déserts ça se traverse

Tout près de la gare du Nord
Ou ça bastonne et déménage
A mort
Allez viens ne sois pas bégueule
Tu sortiras convaincue
On va en prendre plein la gueule

Fini les galères et l'exode
Fini les disques invendus
Dans le vent, de toutes les modes

Et voilà qu'on le catéchise
On le sanctifie doux Jésus

où je traduis tes regards et lis dans tes sourires,

et quand du bout des doigts tu murmures je t'aime,
j'ai l'impression parfois comme entendre ta voix..

C'était cet amour magnifique,
Qu'il avait refait un cantique
Et perdit ses yeux dans l'azure.

Plus long que mon chagrin d'amour,
Même l'éternité
Près de lui serait court.
Plus gris que le gris de ma vie,
Rien ne serait plus gris,
Pas même un ciel de pluie.

On a tort de penser, je sais bien,
Aux lendemains.
A quoi bon se compliquer la vie
Puisqu'aujourd'hui...

Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.
Plus blond que tes cheveux dorés
Ne peut s'imaginer,
Même le blond des blés.
Plus pur que ton souffle si doux,
Le vent, même au mois d'août,
Ne peut être plus doux.
Plus fort que mon amour pour toi
La mer, même en furie,
Ne s'en approche pas.
Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois que les rêves
Que m'apportent tes yeux...
",Plus Bleu Que Tes Yeux,2006
Waldir Calmon,"Un jour le Bon Dieu
Le front soucieux
Se dit mon vieux
Ton grand ciel bleu
N'a rien de rose
Plus j'y réfléchis
Plus je me dis
Qu'il manque ici
Un paradis
Ou autre chose
Il fit tant et bien
Avec ses mains
Et presque rien
En un peu moins
D'un semaine
Qu'il avait créé
Les champs, les prés
L'hiver, l'été
Et aussi les
Formes humaines
Il les convoqua
Leur dit ""voilà
Avec tout ça
Vous n'avez qu'à
Vivre tranquilles
Je vous en fais don
Tout y est bon
Mais attention
D'être dociles
Et de me faire la promesse
De ne pas toucher
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier""
Le bon Dieu parti
Adam se dit
Ben mon ami
T'es mieux ici
Que dans une usine
T'as une poupée
Une beauté
Qui est roulée
Comme pour tourner
À la Goldwine
Et ce brave Adam
Passait le temps
En souriant
Béatement
Comme bien des hommes
Sans avoir idée
Que sa moitié
Puisse flirter
Avec un r'présentant en pomme
Eve trouvait charmant
Et affolant
Ce beau Tarzan
Nommé Serpent
Dit à sornettes
Qui sut l'envoûter
La fasciner
Lui fair' croquer dans la pomme
Et perdre la tête
Au point d'oublier sa promesse
De ne pas toucher au pommier
Non, de ne pas toucher au pommier
Non, de ne pas toucher au pommier
Tout commence ici
Eve en folie
Pris un beau fruit
Et le tendit
A son p'tit homme
Et le brave Adam
Toujours confiant
À belles dents
Mordit dedans
Comme une pomme
Lorsque Dieu l'apprit
Avec mépris
Il leur a dit
Plus d'paradis
Non, je vous condamne
À vivre et lutter
À travailler
Hiver, été
Et tout ça c'est
À cause d'une femme
C'est ainsi depuis
Que la vie
Même aujourd'hui
L'homme est trahi
Dans l'ignorance
Et le vieux pommier
Presque oublié
Est remplacé
Par le péché
De complaisance
Car les femmes tiennent leur promesse
De ne pas toucher au pommier
Non de ne pas toucher au pommier
Car, elles préfèrent goûter au péché
C'est si doux, c'est si doux
De goûter au péché
Ah! C'est doux, de goûter au péché
De goûter au péché",A  Propos de Pommier,2006
Waldir Calmon,"Sur ma vie, je t'ai juré un jour
De t'aimer jusqu'au dernier jour de mes jours, 
Et le même mots devait très bientôt
Nous unir devant dieu et les hommes

Sur ma vie, je t'ai fait le serment
Que ce lien tiendrait jusqu'à la fin de temps
Ainsi nous vivions ivres de passion
Et mon cœur voulait t'offrir mon nom

Près des orgues qui chantaient
Face à dieu qui priait 
Heureux je t'attendais
Mais les orgues se sont tues
Et dieu a disparu, car
Tu n'es pas venue

Sur ma vie, j'ai juré que mon cœur 
Ne battrait jamais pour aucun autre cœur
Et tout est perdu car il ne bat plus
Mais il pleure mon amour déçu

Sur ma vie, je t'ai juré un jour

Bad bitch with me look like the Kardashians
Pull up in the club in that brand new Aston
Jumped I jumped the line cause I’m very important
Shawty got a kush habit, but I ain’t supporting it
She rock knockoff bags, it’s 2012
Tried to steal her some trues, so she just got out of jail
Boyfriend an athlete, baby daddy a dope boy
But she still get food stamps and still on welfare
But she phat as a motherfucker, I think she got ass shots
Stay in some red bottoms, don't know if they real or not
She have her ups and her downs, somehow she always go hard
She say she work for herself, ain’t going in nobody jobs

Bomb chicks, no bomb chicks, and the classy ones who I now fuck with
Had a lack of class, so I dropped her ass
And even if I don't, I switch subjects
Put no nigga over your seat, get your figures up by all means
He been gone a lot but know the times is hard
But know the club is not no release
Don’t you talk too much in these streets
Make no friends with none of these freaks
'Cause they interest isn't on you, bet you break up, they calling up heat
Don't you stress him over no B's, don’t buy things from off canal street
When the phone ring don’t ask who dialing

And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless, it’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times were harder than the cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the corner back
Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back

Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it

It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? It’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something thats in your veins

You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I aint spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically the MC
Lebron shit, I was heading six after twenty three
And family is everything and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas, fuck you and your position!

I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend for what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad no)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

Let me tell you about, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it

I’m just tryna read your mind, I’m just tryna feed you mine
I’m just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Chorus]
We’re living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It’s feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can’t you see
I’m talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you’re Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don’t need no rush
Don’t believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri’s
I just think we need one night, can’t decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain’t right
I ain’t thinking I ain’t right, can’t decide but I can’t fight
Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots with your flavor, flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it’s done right
With that gorgeous face, I don’t know your name, it ain’t important babe cuz 
I’mma call you Mine

[Chorus]

Cuz I don’t know you, you don’t know me
The clock keeps tickin’ baby, what’s it gonna be
I don’t know you, you don’t know me
Let me teach you all the sounds of love

So many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

Light skin, dark skin, sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Make no promises but promise I could fuck you better
Fuck that singing shit, I be the shit
That YM, too legit to quit
You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up on my latest chick
She saying it's that greatest dick
I one-two stroke her
We caught up in the moment, aye

Got a bucket full of liquor
And I know y'all got that bad bitch
But ya got way too many nigga's
What's your phone numb'?
Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack with your bad ass
'Cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up
Smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin' I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up
New York and my slow bucks
DC got that old cup
Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks
Straight shot sipper
I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding
Y'all some Fisher-Price nigga's
And we some life livers hoping that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us

I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name) 
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby) 
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane 
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time 
Girl how could we get that way? 
 
Look, another day another dollar 
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her 
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick 
But if I call you gone be like ""Boo why we haven't Skyped yet?"" 
And I Skype, bet you say ""Lay where my flight at"" 
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at 
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more than hectic 
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort 
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive 
Women will sell they soul just to buy some attention 
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression 
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions 
Please, fear watchu don't know 

[Chorus]

Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her 
If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven 
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain 
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi town over here 
We spend some time and get some wine have some miles from Harrod's 
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby 
Gotta get back to the D you know we finally famous 
Driver drop me off in Dallas I'm headed to some money 
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage 
I know Ima always leave em but I swear I'll always love em 
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood 
That baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta St. Louis 
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier, 
She my Billie Jean we Minaj with Mary Jane 
See we city hop, Vegas to LA, brings a lotta joy Bugatti boy that's Laina Lane 
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench, 
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist 
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs

Accountable for half a million uncounted for

I ain't been the easiest nigga to deal with
I'm heavily flawed!
But far from a false Prophet
I'm a mufucking honorable Folarin
Cassius, Muhammad, McGregor, Conor of these rap artists
Why you talking?
Mufucking Groundhog's Day

The most highly underrated of my generation
Behind them crooked smiles niggas neglect to embrace me
Respect is in order now
My liquor is more to y'all
You throwing them little shots, we catching some cases
Lot of niggas hate to love me or they love to hate me
Labeled as reckless and crazy by my record label
Doctors say it's bipolar disorder, he diagnosing me wrong
It's obviously depressing counting blue faces
Hey, here go that real shit
Battling anxiety and privately them Percocets
Purchased like 30 of them, murdered them in like 30 hours
Weight of the world on my shoulders I bet I military press
I remember me and Cole would open for Hov
Everyday a star is born, I guess I died in the womb
I ain't make it on Blueprint, so made me a blueprint
You got you a nice watch, my minutes was finished
I was lost at Interscope
Contemplating on copping a block from Benning Road
Thoughts of suicide 'cause who gon' want you alive 
When niggas you used to ride with cry with all that high shit
Talking down in they interviews
I ain't forget that Scott
Only difference is I didn't get no sympathy calls to get back up
I just heard a song about me on a hip-hop blog from a kid I know
Some niggas say a hiphop God
It hit home 'cause there's some truth, this I know
This ace I go, I get psycho when shit get dark
Boy when shit get dark
Like Laurene Powell I've gotten married to a job
I drop my jewels, spit my bars, I get mine off, I be pissed off
Should get more props but still I
Pimp hard, drink hard liquor to forget my thoughts
Push 3 buttons I make the joint spin, Balrog (hey)
Hoes say I'm the realest
Most hated on Twitter
Not to 'cause a situation but what side of my biracial friends call me they nigga?
Forget it
I'm jih tripping
But my skin is made of chocolate, a copper's bullets is diabetic
My mind busy, I'm sad daily though I deal with it
My therapist terrible, I'm a terp in mellow trembling
Real subtle though
Tell them niggas SHINE coming, they in trouble though
I love my brother though
I love my brother though
That's why it's rest in peace to Tommy we still bumping Cole

And they say
For as the sun shines on candle mass day
So far will the snow swirl until May
For as the snow blows on candle mass day
So far will the sun shine before May
Now in layman's terms that means
All you naysaying, instigating, player hating
Niggas be safe though
I'm on my way to Raleigh so grateful for that inspiration
I'll see you at the game bro

So they concerts on they labels

We gonna love the when the party’s over

Who you talkin' about, her? I'd a got right back

When you first left me, I didn't know what to say. 
I'd never been on my own that way. Just sat by myself all day

You miss me, huh?

I was so lost back then.
 But with a little help from my friends, I found a light in the tunnel at the end. 
Now you're calling me up on the phone. 
So you can have a little whine and a moan. 
And it's only because you're feeling alone

Nah, I'm just kinda bored, baby

At first, when I see you cry- Yea it makes me smile.
Yea it makes me smile. At worst I feel bad for a while, 
but then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Who you talkin' about me? Oh nah

Whenever you see me you say that you want me back. 
And I tell you it don't me jack, No it don't mean jack

No I just couldn't help myself. 
See you messed up my mental health.

I was touchin' out, I got right back. 
Like Pen Pals or a Email Chat. S
ee I aim like [Aine] Her Frame her mind was nothin' to be pictured. 
But she ain't wanna listen. We kick like Fulham. 
And it was just a quickie. But really wanna make love and Lily my religion. 
Simply, I can be that and all that. I got cheese I could turn you to a mall rat. 
I won't leave 'em at your door like a doormat.
 And I'm a keep knockin' at it like a Morman. 
The more men lie, the more she saw from 'em, protection she endorsed by endorphins. 
The other girl I adored was a whore joint. 
The neighborhood roller her mother was an orphanage. 
No tears, those so tears zero From here on out I am all about dinero like Pesci. 
so now let the lets be set free and see if we're lovers or enemies. Test me

Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save

Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit

And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Ran through the bullshit like a Matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the Industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

Uptown What up
B&g what up
The revolution will proceed
Unification of the dmv I will achieve indeed
I decree I'm forming a new alliance
Oppose the one poisoning the minds
They lying
I am only a fighter
In the form of a writer
In the form of a poet
Potency in the mic
I blank out then I approach it
Turn me up and I go in
Haters learn to Bear
I'm Lovie Smith with the vocals
Lord I'm so focused more focused than I ever been
So slightly passed em, like the letter ""n""
It's DC, black jeans, black tee
This that North Face rap, WALE, you better get me

Saratoga, 640, Berry Farms, 1-4, KDY, every corner, everybody got em on

no congressional reppers, no respectable rappers
It's the way we've adapted, don't forget I made it happen
The most opinionated city you can make it in
And still a nigga made it here
I'm Neo in the matrix
Knees dug deep into the pavement
DMV so we used to the waiting
Nobody seems to care we so complacent with the vacancy
See, the love is gone with one another, it's hard
Nobody rep for the skins, they busy cheering them stars
It's ironic, it's the same for the artists
Rather than buy our songs, they busy cheering the stars
A lot of drama
A lot of beef
We have so much in common, starting at the feet
Goadome Nikes, the cortazone of the poem writer
None like us
So none like us
Flyer than the rest of em

this where the haters is
This why they hate us here
This why I hate it here
Though love it, I made it here
We all here, from the dealers to the kids
To the squares to the fly
One thing we are aligned with
Black on black Nikes
That represent the lifeless lives
And it reflects the plight of those fighting so
If we ain't right and always at the throats
Of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes a
Metaphor, for the insecure
If you ain't wearing no color, can't nobody say nothing
One can never be judged when he dress like his brothers
Melancholy we are though we all learn to love it
Pessimistic we are
Carry odds like luggage
And through all our troubles
We still walk around walk around

Wale,"Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for
I got something you've been waiting for

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that
The radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga
Well I'm a downtown shoota who that?
The crown ruler is back
He congruent to the shape of a mack
Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back
This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just makin' it hap
To all the frauds stop fakin' relax
And to the broads if you cakin'
Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back
I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that
Cause what they playin' on the station is wack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad is so fresh
You know its Black Thought and your boy the Bro Quest, but

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go

Hip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us
I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it
We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen
And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics
But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin'
So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin'
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it.
They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin'
This is the trial and error era no co defendant
I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it
I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

So get your glass lift it up and in toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it

We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go

Where my grimey figures at? look lively addressing the captain
Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh answer me what kind of question is that
I'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap
And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad? so fresh
You know its Black Thought and your boy the bro Quest, but

Wale,"And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)

Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress she really wanna make it
In the ""City of Lights"", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
Nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
'Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilets in sight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To be seven pounds, you must release several pounds
This is heaven on hell
This is how she wanna live
She ain't really trippin', she's on Beverly Hills

And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)

Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rents up
In her defense-she part of the crowd
She gonna borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from rosay, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibition is gone, she just wanna be known
She wanna be know, she just wanna be known
Pulling down her skirt
""I never done this before"", nah

And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)

You know big-breast girls
Never ever pay rent
They meet the rich boys
Throw D's on that bitch
Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the male entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But It's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next to you let down on a nigga

And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)
She live her whole life like TV
And she do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is (90210)",90210,2009
Wale,"[Chorus]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this,
It's like sunshine on a rainy day,
It's like a, ""How could you take me away?""
""Take me away.""
""Away.""
It's a beautiful bliss.
When you feel like this (beautiful bliss)
When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss)
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with tits
And you aint bothered a bit now baby.

Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the tan with the clippers
Like Sean Lippet thinking, hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf like skibbit
Its slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil night hard mine is bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it
When Brett Hart meet Brett Favre
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less stick some more
On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My pro-ject is like what pros inject
And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see them boys sign me to the 'Scope, right?

[Chorus]

I fall whole to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil' nigga 
From the ville could get a deal
And tell them niggas at the top 
We want yo spot we are for real
And yet we heard you got it locked 
But like them socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga
Especially on your flows nigga
'Cause man they keep on checking 
For me especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep
You see me let me in
All I wanna' do is eat
I'm like the freaky lesbian
Know all I wanna' do is ball on TV knee E.S.P.N.
They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say, ""Let's be friends.""
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls that we knew scream, ""Fuck you""
Gon' let me in
I'm definitely in a class of my own
And dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton
He just pass the Patron
And he ain't givin' dog is earned
If you just live in dog you learn
I let you niggas see the light
I'm like the prison yard I yearn
For that living large but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your son rise
Kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet
And never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said, ""Fuck the world and I ain't come yet.""
You up yet?
My punchlines like gut checks
I'm raw dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck
I'm up next
I'm godbless
I'm success
So fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the ville boy
(Aye Wale, good looking.)

[Chorus]

Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet
Fuck it
I don't be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
Then you can keep it running
Like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A list actors
They not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function
I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture
Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a paintin' or a lakehead
This shits how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement 'cause
Shift the keys get your capital raised up

Wale,"Dear sweetheart, whats up boo
Whatchu up to?
More club moves?
I call her, no answer
Her phone in the bag, she dancing
Its four now, the clubs over
I call her, but oh hold up
Y'all know what? ignore button
Or the phone die, lets hope for it
That damier bag I bought her
Caught the attention of those niggas on it
That cellphone that I bought
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers
So it leaves me to wonder
Why do I still promise to love her?
Cut me off every time I'm talking
Which means she ain't never hear nothing
I say ""stay"", she wanna leave
She get her point across so I gotta let her be
Ima let her be by herself in peace
But five years from now I bet she see
When the club gets played
The things you crave are no longer escapes
And no longing for dates
You want a husband, but no one has a cape
Now you wondering ""wait""
And I ain't trying to hear what you wanting to say
It feels good to be over you, babe
So play this shit while you contemplate, contemplate, contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate

Them people, they talking
Them lights, they on me
This life I chose
But I ain't know, til I found it
To be honest, I'm modest
One hater for every nigga on it
One day everybody is applauding
The next day you is everybody target
Why bother? why talk to em?
Where God at? I need to call Him
My knees on the ground, Dear Father
Don't let me break, please make me stronger
How much longer, will it linger?
Well my heart is giving will they believe it
When my song is over will they need me?
Watch how quickly they find a new leader
Questioning the whole meaning
In the viper room with just me and river phoenix
With Courtney love and late Washington
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading
This ain't her, Chris Benoit
Heath ledger said the nights gonna be dark
Feel the size of a fellas ? and low
Apollo theater I might just not go
Franky Lymon the lime light gets old
Cold so in a while I'm schitzo
I cant cope, I cant think
I cant breathe, this ain't me
This ain't easy, I'm thinking
Am I doing this for them or me?
I cant think, am I doing this for them or me?

Wale,"If I told you I wanted to talk to you,
You think I'm try'na holla at you,
And maybe I am but,
You wouldn't hear me out anyways would you? ,
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like,
Short days, long nights,
By the phone, no call,
Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind,got me goin' down that road,
Heart made of stone,
Far away from home,
Black woman you cold,
Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face,
Started off on thin ice,
I'm still here but I can't skate,
Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, don't think,
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat,
Queen, you deserve the title
But she rejects what I give,
While she nurse the wounds by them,
Tried them, didn't work,
Got impossible standards,
Nothing I'm a do is gon' work,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,
I don't know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow,

Raised by a momma who, who,
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with,
Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick,
I'm just tryna be the one who never run,
But you run away from me,
Girlfriends man cheat, cheat,
Why not me the same thing,
She can't see in me, what I see in her,
This pain she inherit can't be reversed,
I can't even stay living in the shade
Of all the motherfuckers who played you,
The irony in that is that I ain't even that,
But you put in these pages,
Wife, you deserve the label
But, but, you been hurt before so you don't feel your able,
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards,
Nothing that I ever do works,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,
I don't know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow,

See all I wanna do is be relevant,
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more,
That you could ever see me and you in another light,
But its like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man,
See all of them have made you incapable of a first impression,
What it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna,
Just intentions to impress you if capable,
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you,
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind,
For such an ugly picture and,
Money, nothing I buy can buy more time
For your ears to tell your heart to listen to it,
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say
But believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways,
And everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary,
The day before is better than the present,
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences,
There's no key for release,
No reason to be around,
Her minds in the clouds,
She writes it all down,
In her diary,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,

And ignorance was drug of choice but they OD'd
Couldn't alone leave 'em

And if you not convinced keep on promotin' them
I breathe life in the game, they are Kevorkian
They provokin' suicide but as soon as signed
I drew designs for consumer's minds so in time

Chip on my shoulder
Big enough to feed Cambodia
See, I never fit into they quotas
Sneakers wasn't fitting and my knees needed lotion
Long before I knew the significance of a comb
I roam like phone with no vocal reception
Immigrant parents had me feeling like a step-kid
And black Americans never did accept me
That's why I thrive so much, win and respect dig
I never fit in with them light skins
I felt the lighter they was the better that they life is
So I resented them and they resented me
Cheated on light-skinned Dominique when we was seventeen
I figured I'd hurt her, she'd evidently hurt me, 
And all women who had light features
See, I never let a light broad hurt me
That's why I strike first and the first cut's deep

[Chorus]
All my light skinned girls to my dark skin brothers
Shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover
Boy you're so beautiful boy 
You're so beautiful shades doesn't matter 
Heart makes the lover
Boy (beautiful caramel),
Boy (beautiful coffeepot)
Boy (Beautiful chocolate)
Boy (Beautiful toffee)
Boy (Beautiful pecan)
Boy (beautiful licorice)
(boy you're so beautiful)

Just another knotty head nigga
Hoping Wes Snipes make my life a bit different
In middle school, I had the right to be timid
I had beautiful words but girls never listened
Listen, blacker the berry, sweeter the product
Well, I'm fruit punch concentrate and they water
Walk into my room thinking how to make moves
Ain't thinking like a student but how Ice-T do it
Light dudes have the girls looking there all year
It's not fair, the ones with the good hair
Couldn't adapt to naps, I wavecap they naps and slept on me
Man, I hate black
Skin tone, I wish I could take it back
Or rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki
Associating light skin with classy
The menstrual show showed and me, that was not me

[Chorus]

They say black is beautiful
But ask them beautiful light girls 
If its black they attract to usually
What if Barack skin was all black, truthfully?
Would he be a candidate or just a black in community?
Because black dudes tend to lack unity
And them blacker girls ain't on the tube, usually
Right now, at 23, I ain't mad at them reds no more
But for long time I had gone cold
Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back to reds, 
I ain't know how to act
They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act
A defense mechanism what I thought that I lacked
Confidence

[Chorus]",Shades,2009
Wale,"Ladies and gentlemen 
I ain't tryin to be politically correct

And my vision isn't set on the money I get

I ain't ?, just feelin' how you felt when you came more or less
The change is imminent
I asked Mr. West for a little bit of help
Realized us new niggas got to get it ourself
So I dreamed of presentin' myself
And the only thing I fear is I being shelved

Book so many bitches should of been a Cum Laude
Fuck the camaraderie with B rate artists

Tommie Frazier on the motherfuckin' one or two's
Or Michael Vick if y'all bark nigga, y'all through 

Yeah, 25, 25, 25, can I get 30?
My side Jones is fat and my freak Jones is purdy
Why? 'Cause I Mac like (Bernie)

Not Puckett but I hit it then I duck a bitch

I wear my Nike boots in Gucci 
I don't wear no Timbo 
I kick it any tempo

I'm poppin' champagne, drinkin' till I'm jumpin' out the window,
Ha ha If the autotune's gone bet they'll all tune in 
So I'mma do it bigger than an Audemar wrist watch 
Hip-Hop slackin', 
Why they gettin' Grammies when these niggas is actin? 
They phony, should get Tonies 
For the thing that they be yappin' 
It's utterly bologna so I'm Muslim to these rappers 
Fuck yappin' they lucky we don't clap em 
And have them people leakin' like they're CD isn't mastered 
CD is in plastic, these niggas is has-beens 
We ain't makin friends while these niggas is Anistons 
Dig, these niggas is fake Joe 
Hip-Hop need to wake up, we the fuckin' clock radios 

[Chorus]
We original officially the most original 
If we wasn't so original then we'd be criminal 
Wale and K'naan they don't know is they're radio 
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radio

They told me go in, no problem I'mma go in 
And shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man 
And there ain't been no buster prepared for you suckas 
Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was duck hunt 
That's words to my mama, since I was in a starter 
A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar 
Shit didn't finish college, shit wasn't a problem 
Shit my homecoming is here I'm who they call up 
So I still be on that yard with a feely of that Marley 
From the city the Philly women willing to menage 
Though I put em on pause since Manilli been involved 
Though everybody's on me like the Milli V part 
Now I'm from the D Dot where we not no beat boxers 
We talkin' B blockers keep us with deep pockets 
See not no fad or no internet phenom 
But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker 
Me I'm not shy and my partner's Somalian 
K'naan and my buzz is too big like Comala 
Ballin', Folarin so goddamn hard 
Fat rhymes every time bitch Roseanne bars, Wale 

[Chorus]

I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret 
And Wale been tellin' other rappers take a deep breath 
And don't perform after him or you might regret 
I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet 
You know if you was harder than me then you'd be led 
And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead 
And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just trynna eat bread 
Fuckin' with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge 
Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets 
Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless 
Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces 
I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest 
Don't cross me cause my friend I'm no Jesus 
I don't turn cheecks or draw blood like leeches 
And my friend's a nut me spark in heaters 
Get your ass privileges with parking meters 
Do I condone it or is this some kinda small talk? 
Course not, I'm big like horse nut 
Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut 
I'm from the ten shacks where mishaps 
Get fix fast by klick klacks and big bwaps 
And inside they think rap soft 
My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar 
No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough 
Now I'm off

Wale,"Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think there'd be a day like this (Naw!)
Not now not ever, 
And now until forever you will never need another (Nigga!)

Look,
Sorry hiphop, it took me so long to get on 
But so long that I'm on it, it's on!
I'm rappin' for the scholars and the hustla's, meanwhile
Showin' mama I ain't dropped out for nothin'!
I swear these dolla's gon' add up
And I ain't shallow, material things suppress bad luck
That's why I shine like I does, 
It's pain in my eyes but these east saints blind you to look
Binded between, carryin' the flag for an area that drag, 
Whoever tried to gravitate
G told me it's a city full of crimes, 
I'm feelin' like a platter at Philip's when I rap
As much as I wanted to be minisculed the fact is, 
They'd only be happy with a minstrel actor
Sorry Mr. Charlie won't chap dance, 
And fuck the radio for tellin' me to snap jam
I'm just expectin' the spectator's respect here
My net is from jet setters to cab fares
Hip-hop's unbalances got out of hand
Ain't have to see-saw, I'm already scared
I been called the
And I DC'd this whole fuckin' genre
And I ain't in it for them O's or them comma's
But more or less the hope for dope niggas to prosper
Yes sir

The future is now, 
I lead on record's dedication for makin' better music is now
Dope niggas locked out 4 year rap drought
It's rainin' now somehow the fugitive's out
I would invest in a poncho, 
'Cause I ain't finna punch out like Glass Joe (Naw!)
Ima go until my arm's sore, fuck it! I go until my 40 millionth encore
Hip-hop's dead yeah that's what Nas said to me
I guess that's hip-hop heads on salary
We've had the tables, on them record labels
Who's next to release? We guillotine them
Niggas braggin' but everybody stagnant 
Everybody broke except the nigga on the track (Shit!)
And mama why you throw away my drums?
A hundred for a deal they made a hundred on the song
Nigga I'm a hundred miles far, I'm feelin' Chris Childs
You lookin' like Kobe Bryant ya'll
It's lonely at the top so I waited, but ain't nobody take it
Now I'm playin' solitaire patient

Wale,"I saw a dried up river and a rich man
Turning on a garden hose
I see a young man picking up a gun
I guess that's where the money goes, yeah

Or am I just as bad as a good man

Some people do it all for money
And some do it all for their love, yeah
Some do it all for the glory
'Cause nothing else they're thinking of

I saw a man in a four door truck
Complaining that the price is high
Like a well feed man with a spoon in his hand

This shit was for a ticket man I call that shit that free lunch
I tell a ho to speed up
She slow and she can keep up
We know we always out
But somehow they would never see us
Peep her gold chain, hoes changed, I didn't
They say that karats help your vision
But somehow it made them listen
No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma
Arrogant when I finish
I came from humble beginnings
So it's nothing to finish
I put my hundred percent in
I put my pot in the paper
And modify your opinion
Trying to give them light and a message
But you rather have some fucking V.V.S's
She said I'm charming and I meant it
But she was talking about my pendant
I got geechi on her, came back with thirty chains
Now she attentive, I bet she listen to everything
Straight geechi on her, came back with eighty chains
Now them silly bitches calling me like everyday

I think them broads gon' follow
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)
Silly bitches gon' follow
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)

I think them broads gon' follow
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)
Silly bitches gon' follow

Gettin' geechi on em
Straight geechi on 'em
You talking greasy, best believe they gon' see ya, don't it
Geechi on 'em
Straight geechi on 'em
Let's keep it G, nobody see you when you being humble

Look, she so stingy with vagina
But why it open when them niggas get to shining?
I was hoping you would notice where my mind at
Put money in the book, I bet these bitches wouldn't find it
Look, okay this chain music, fuck how them lames do it
You chained to it, your brain's been, your brain has been way too influenced
I been dope, cold nigga for sure nigga
But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga
She seen that geechi shit, ain't been to church since
Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix
Lord Lord forgive us, personalities clash
And my license is suspended, so I hide it
I don't spend it, did I get y'all attention?
She can't escape the chain, shoutout to Mrs. Tubman
Shout out to Maybach Music, my logic is getting money
Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it
Shady flow, Johnny Cage, chain flow, Johnny Dang
Been balling, six bottles, talk with such expensive slang
I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga
So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga
I got geechi on her, came back, a hundred chains
And now these geechi mother fuckers all know my name
Geechi on her, came back, a million chains
I said geechi mother fuckers all know my name

Broads gon' follow

Niggas gon' follow

Wale,"In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see, or hear rather

Destined to win, get respect where I live
My reflection contagious, I’m the messenger here
Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread
They ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed
When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air
All I’m hearing is aids, I ain’t deaf in my ear
Nah, I ain’t deaf in my ear
But he push them whites in the hood like ray Evans was there
Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it
Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation
Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer
Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother
Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either
Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him
See, it’s cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate
Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?
Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up
Still different ablers killing over what isn’t theirs
Lost my nigga over nothing though
Saheed Elesha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul

I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though
Saheed Elesha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul
Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting
Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald’s position
Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower
Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas
They ain’t really for condoms, I just think that it’s shocking
Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors
I’m aware that there’s problems, know Obama gon’ stop it
Where there’s minimal conscious and there’s thousands of choppers
I know Howard that college, but that town has some problems
I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise
Little women be mommas, little niggas ain’t fathers
Ain’t nobody here leading, it’s way too easy to follow
They knee deep in today, ain’t too fond of tomorrow
Although it gets you paper, I pray you weighing your options
This is soulful my nigga, I’m hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga
We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga
This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga
We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga
Nigga, know you my
And you know my nigga
Know you my
Look

I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell
So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail
I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and
I pray whenever I’m seen in my city I forever resemble braille
May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud
May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud
May your glass never reach half-empty,
May your enemies find the inner-piece before it ever get to beef
I wish you, wealth, health, and pact free women for yourself
And the shit ain’t the best, hope these lyrics help, my nigga

I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

Fuck how they feel, I keeps it realer than a documentary
Shit I be feeling like real niggas don't make it to fifty
And I be feeling Malcolm, Martin, and Pac would defend me
I focus on chicken, my cortizone frigid
Don't trust no cheap rubbers, don't trust no dirty bitches
Sippin moscato with models having exotic dishes

Got me counting my blessings, it took me Haiti to see

When you rapping how I'm rapping, they fellatio free
I was pacing myself, hope you patient as me
Plus I got a lot, niggas ain't able to see it

Niggas awful at dressing, they just aight at music
I'm trend-setting, despite of a awful debut
Still got me another deal because any nigga in music

They ain’t grossing a million, liquid don’t form an opinion
I’m sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend
Sort of Tommy Lasorda
The way I’m sorting these pitchers
Pitchers whatever, fuck it my speech is off
Weekend trip to wherever, only heaven is far
Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars
Jordan four seated floor side sittin with mobs
Only fear is mediocrity
Every time I got a beat I feel like I don’t gotta sleep
You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling
Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks
I'm sort of like Socrates in a Prada T
You can’t kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer teams
People fuckin’ with me, they ain’t fuckin with you
Lyrically sup hmm being generous too
I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room
Made some moves, now I’m known to spit December and June
Rented a coupe, cool, met me a chick
Always keep a rubber, word to telling your kids
If you gon do what you gon do, go handle your biz
Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill
For real, you real then I don’t need to say it
It’s something to be great, it’s nothing to be famous

Fuck everything anyone can take from me
It ain’t hard to make money

‘So what thoughts’ keep me anxious, Moet gon’ keep me calmer
Poetry keep her honest, these readings Stevie could draw up
Don’t see this deeper than music, don’t hear it but feel the author
I don’t hear no talking, we just hear them barking
And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins
Failure is not an option, success is just a process
Say “yes” one time they use you, say “no” one time they plotting
Didn’t make it through college, still debating my progress
End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums
Limitations for cowards, this is Shay mixed with Malcolm
This is anti Mark McGuire it takes patience for power
Zoning my six rillo legendaries forever
Roll a nigga that lala, that’s how I play the 'Melo
Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you
And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella
Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper
Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them
I Aspire for awesome and require some flossing
Only way they gon' listen, find it highly unfortunate
Tryna see if real lyric spittin can buy me a Porsche
Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions
I decided to boss up, life’s a bitch and I caught her
Don’t always fuck me good, I’m just too cheap to divorce her

So fuck fame, and fuck money
And fuck everything anyone can take from me

And you got that bomb, huh, I’m tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that’s why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause

This is not no Sandra Bull, but you’re Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don’t need no rush
Don’t believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri’s
I just think we need one night, can’t decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain’t right
I ain’t thinking I ain’t right, can’t decide but I can’t fight
Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots with your flavor, flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it’s done right

The bitches is everything in between

Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off
Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for
Yeah, can't wait 'til the wheels down
And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around
Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed
I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud
Catching Heat floor seats and we all fresh
From coarse seats to court seats is progress, of course
Tell them other niggas ""man up""
Tell Lebron drop fifty unless he playin' us
KOD a couple fifty's like a precinct
Straight conch got a nigga feeling seasick oh shit
Chef creole, two seater
And my watch looking like it's all three P O
Two V's in the street blowing trees with hoes
And more weed for me, shout out to Meek PO

Look, I know you not gay or nothing
But we should find another girl with a tapeworm
I'm in a rental on collins
Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys
With a model and some limited Bvlgari
My name hold weight and you don't really keep the bar raised
With dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids
Its not far from white girls with big bread
And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking
But right there, they skill scheming, they not eating
Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason
And when you repping Wet Willies you ain't even thinking

OK black Panamera, dash on a million
It ain't nothing better than a passionate woman
She graduated top of the class, Carol City or was it the west
Hold up I don't remember really, hold up
Two whips, six tattoos, no kids
And I heard you come alive, when you gonna live?
I ain't trying to be ignorant, but I'm leaving town in a little bit
Miami nights, ain't another one, until the buzz go away lets have a little fun
Paradise, get away, thinking why its not South Beach everyday

We got the jet waiting on us at the airport homie
We got money to go get baby
Let's get it

Don't regurgitate my sperm
Let me work that, no nasty
But I'm actually quite respectful
But you call a bitch a bitch
And real bitches don't respect you

But I guess that shit's just tough love
Around my way, I'm cut throat

Weed up, better make a sound
Greened up, I'm like baby Sal
Higher than high school
Mariah tunes and five flutes
Owe five to Hooper's and light shoes
Never liked school
Reckless when I move
Where I'm from, it get cold
Niggas die over shoes
Niggas shoot over bitches

Stuck up beat up and wet up

That's why forever I love seldom and trust never

Was on my grind cause times were harder than the cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine

Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting

Where I'm from is the circus, hope you don't expect a fair one 
Dropping hundreds like it aint nothing 
Really it was but you know I never sayin' nothing

Drop the work off the scale, throw some ice in the pot
Then let that Arm and Hammer, hammer it right to a lot
Tryna whip a Rollie or Cartier
Shout out to this Pyrex, that bought this Audemeer
Oops I meant Audemar, my whole team got them
You loving the same bitch, my whole team poppin'
My hundred dough, I'm wherever that money go
Glock nine in my underclothes, you cop two of them, we frontin' four
Fuck niggas we don't fuck with dough
Bad bitches never lets them know
Keep them round but never trust them, no

Some niggas walking with death guess they ran out of options
Tell them niggas we moving, tell them niggas to do it
I swear we going ham, throw some, my niggas sew me
They burn on every block,

Shit ain't been the same since Ronald Reagan helped Plymouth rock
And we don't land on it Mr. Reagan,
But this gonna make us rich Mr. Reagan
Now As-Salamu Alaykum Wa alaikum as salaam
She near that every Friday and then go to Jumaa
Let her play with the box, she give the greatest top

Start the applause, a rebel soul lifted
Preaching for the paper paparazzi, federales severe rallies, massacre lives
Teaching to Shabazz that's Malik on behind the grass
Corruption over cash, leave them leaking in the cask'
Ain't better, you better rebel, smell cheddar and shells
Malcolm ? platinum in Africa when he sat in a cell
My religion the kitchens, papa formulas
Benjamins to make sure my pockets abnormal
My philosophy is rocks and weed, a partna lean, the glock will squeeze
Niggas clocking dollars don't know how to read with mouths to feed
It's hard when starving Marcus Garvey messed with Malcolm Little
Knowledge Was obtained, fuck your chains and your master nigga
We in the field building muscle while you watch the house
And dusting off the porcelain and open when their cock is out

Pork on the fork, widen the pot

You bammas like Hyperstrikes, your wifey sleep outside of you
And Tito's my niggas, you know just we just need more shit and
It's ironic how I drop some dough when I got them Homer Simpsons, look
Pine-green Foams, they may never see the store
Got LeBron Entourages like Maverick and Richie Paul

Look at my nines, look at my Blazers, look at my fours, cut wit' laser
Look at my whore, that is your lady, look at my flo', makin' y'all crazy

Wrong move and that tool fly, better Kon that ass like Wu-sai

Walk around wit' like ten on me, that five seven, that fen' on me
Don't grin on me wit' them long stares, you ain't God unless no fear
Big money, all the hoes, HD, I came so clear
We jeweled out and we racked up, Phantom big when it back up
Big Boy, look like a Mack truck, shooters ride wit' that Mac tucked
I'm a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff, Simpson-Rodgers, my last cup
On this shit, I can't stand up, country Ks as I man up
This Rozay, Wale, Gunplay, and that nigga Pill

One week and we get the deal, one day and I fucked the bitch

I'm slowly roastin', heatin' up, so you know we toastin'
Fuck hoes wit' no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin'
Out in Sweden, like ain't shit that you can't tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
'Cause uh, they had them Js, and my mama wouldn't cop 'em
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches wann't a option
Now we livin' much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about 'em forever
My kicks like my chick, I don't need to know the numbers
You just need to know I'm comin', I'll kill you niggas this summer

Straight flights 

I live by the cold war 
Drove from round the globe 
All I need is a kilo, a apron, show me the stove 
General electric, perfected, cooking them O's 
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves 
Hoes, I need a condom for my toast, busting in these niggas 
Standing flat footed, I'm on my toes 
Froze, pandemonium overdose 
Paparazzi in the trees, please curtains closed 
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf 
Heroin transactions, with Russian shots of the Smirnoff 
Playing for keeps I buss in 'em 'fore she get off 
I run the city just pull up and drop the kid off 
Welcome to organized crime 
Money got me excited, I'm coming four or five times 
The forty five for you niggas with nine lives 
Penthouse on college, money long as Ocean drive 
Black Chevy Tahoe's, Hatians up out the pothole 
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos 
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue 
Issue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss 
Counting money stacks, yours counter-fitted 
I made my money back, when your accountant didn't 
Went against the odds, its only one Rozay 
My nigga OKAY

I got a penny in my pocket 
Million in the trunk 
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front 
Step out on the block all the bitches they still in shock 
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop 
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium 
Half a million for the same car we rolling in 
Pandemonium, pandemonium 
We the number one niggas your bitch notice it 
 
Million ways to make this money, you gon get it 
On the grind twenty four I'm with it 
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid 
Jumping out the Phantom like a motherfucking midget 
Money knocking at the front door I'm like ""who is it?"" 
It's Benjy, tell my lil nigga ""goin get it"" 
Cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute 
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm spend it 
I'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it 
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it 
Four for my niggas that be stacking it and then blowing it 
You would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in 
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium 
Probly got them keys in, he like my custodian 
I was tryna bag a brick you was Nickelodeon 
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it 
We's part the reason that them Churches got some services 
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering 
Nigga called my phone talking reckless I aint heard of it 
Fuck ya girl, give her back I'm courteous 
I can keep a secret with Vicky have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and telling Megan Good morning 
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris 
From Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear that I want em all 
Wanna fuck em all 
Had my niggas down so I'm screaming fuck the law 
Monday night wrestling, I'm so fucking raw 
She gon wipe me down, I'm gon brush her off 
I'm way harder than the concrete 
I say what my mind speak

For the low that nine cheap 
Call me if you want it, haters see me 
And I'm stuntin' got 'em sick to they stomach

Nudies and some J six 
Where I'm from it's cold 
And niggas get at you like handkerchiefs 
God bless you unless you was disrespectful 
Bitches disappoint you but money won't ever stress you 
They say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down 
So all that shit you niggas kicking we aint worried about 
Catch me at tha carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half 
Fliest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad 
Bitch I got a right to brag 
Bitch I got a right to boast

And I never use my right to vote 
My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous 
And I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming

Like this games new to me

See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

I'm incline with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over had her shopping in Milan
Twenty racks really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari yeah that's the Easter bunny
At the Caesar in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend a half the ticket give or take
A couple dollars Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe 'cause I adored her
More than fly that girls a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said the love of picture just roll the dice

[Chorus]

I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
She said that she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner soul
So the devil that droves in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make up
But ya'll wait up my mind racing my toe slippin'
A lot of women is real some bitches Robin Givings
I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin' bitches that's dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit
Real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love.

I say, how can they compare to you
Everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So I let others shit you on dead, burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you
Like the sound and I ain't ever try tuning you
But now I'm just assuming you
Living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio 'cause everything was air play
First class herm ass
Panamera perp pass
Greed written on her face
When I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck
It was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

But I keep a loud tool 
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool 
Got stock like Dow do

Off the car lot 
Hit the gas tires smoke like cigar shops 
Make ya jaw drop 
Bought it off the narc cops 
Tax on the work we got them H and R blocks 
Alumni yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks 
Looking out for the twelve Roger Staubach 
No cafe but we had them hard rocks 
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks 
So before ya heart stop 
Or the narcs knock 
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot 
Cuz the streets don't play fair 
Niggas mad cuz you got more rides than the state fair 
Terrified I can't lie boy I stay scared

Yeah 
Been at the lowest of my lows 
That's why I get high hoping no one ever know 
To open up my mind I can show you what I wrote 
Or rather show you how to boat 
And hope that you can live or float 
Independently self made 
And well paid 
Three whips one chain no welt pain 
When you treeing over niggas they gon yell shade 
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight 
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging 
But Lincoln park had it looking like back in the eighties 
Now partners getting broads and the hottest whips 
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship 
Ain't have a pot to piss 
I wasn't born rich 
When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch 
She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look 
Leaving wit eight bitches I need some octopus 
See how wale go j four cs 
My lake shore whore never be on the bs 
Bullshit chi town 
Riding around 
Top down 
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around 
What it do 
Penny phones all blue 
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool 
Yellow lam g shit 
She double od shit 
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching

Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass 
But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths 
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache

Fuck is you drunk? 
Pay that up front 
Like the Ferrari trunk 
Be careful you won't 
Have to be sorry hon 
Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n 
Might earn sum'n 
Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n 
Stop talking so much 
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say

She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from the back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months, come back

And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight
I'mma lick in circles now
Tell me what that feel like

Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song 'cause we all the way gone
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, cold world

Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
'Cause we done did that
Tryin' to find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon' keep on watching, give 'em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes

And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The Red album, lil' red shorty, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt

Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voice mail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up, I beat it up

Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long
We gon' make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room
You can pick the next room

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

Pay for that, not me, no hell
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
'Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no showers
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks evolve, but they cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! Without paying for the date
Throw the bait, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my ? was 450, can I used the whip to 550
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
?
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the deener
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man I'm motherfucking cold like Kesha
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup, and I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, ""Nah, niggas you're scared""
Now go get you some bread
See it's money over bitches, and bread over bed
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it

Go girl, a go girl
A top notch thoroughbred, pro girl
She go-go live, she go-go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

An all night putting on a show girl
She go live, she go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

I got this girl that’s on some ?
She call and say she miss me
I tell her I’ma visit next time I’m in her city
I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

[Chorus]

Go, go, keep on going
I be somewhere throwing money, blowing on that potent
Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing
We just go–go anywhere we wanna
Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

[Chorus]

OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in
She wear her heart on her sleeve
Now she just Comme des Garconing
I wake up and show you what this cock-a-doodle-do in the morning
I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

Wow, I really wanna shine
That’s what it boils down to, real shit

I just want my mind to be free
Never mind if they fond of me, I’ve been a beast
I recline in my seat, number nines on my feet
Womanizer admittingly, but mind you I’m deep
Although they inclined to critique
Motherfuck ‘em, they couldn't lace up a nigga’s Chukka’s
‘Cause money talk and I make them bussa’s pay for discussion
Chasing duckets, chasing dreams, got me praying for foes
Chasing hoes, dick ‘em good enough to make ‘em propose
Winning, the feeling is so incredible
Something that’s forever true, my niggas over revenue
Little bit of Chanel, decorate your appearance
Double C’s on your purses, perfect I get the message
Isabel Marant I get you some, you give me that
All of my thoughts fluorescent ink, though I’m always thinking black
Sitting back, cognac, sixty-two behind the pack
I ain’t thug, but I ain’t stupid four niggas, five ? hold up
Fire shots for the winners
And as long as I’m delivering, this genre’s gon’ be winning
Double M-G pimping, my relevance never ending
My penmanship ain't too pretty, my ink is why they gon’ feel me

This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me

This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me
Double M-G, thank you, this the real me

I got a couple old schools and some new girls
They like old jewels and new pearls
They obey no rules, they some rude girls
You know the bad ones that rule the world
They just wanna have fun and crash parties
But when them games is over they down to ride for me
Bonnie and Clyde story, Mick and Mallory
A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me
After that I sit and counting G’s after G
‘Cause it’s right back to these ends
Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends
We can do it all again, the repetition that I like
The reputation of a pimp
And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp
Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent
They say it’s cold-blooded how I talk
I been winning this way for years, so what if I ain’t lost?

This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me

I know you see me with your looking ass
What the fuck you looking at?
This is MMG and we don't speak to all you fucking crabs
Got a bunch of cash, but money is under, fam
I'd rather be over-prepared than slip in here understaffed
Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas
Just a double M, you can't fuck with them
Unless you're certified to ride with us
Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches
And I ain't tripping off of potential, that's another word for ""ain't did shit""
Work, and I put D.C. on, we ain't been this high since the E.R

My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em
Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em
I know you think all we do is have fun around here
But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns
Don't single out any corner, its popping on every one
They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done
I'm running through cake, running through states
Take your one to the face every one or two cakes
Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space
Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga

Ah fuck her, I don't care
Plus I got another over there
She been wanting to be with me
Got her in her underwear
Gave her what she want, now she need me
I got more of that coming over soon
Lingerie all up in my room
I'ma make this toast to that one girl I love
I still smell her perfume

Since you've been away, love's been MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love

My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her I don't care
Told me that she loved me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare

I call her up but she won't answer

I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me

He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?

I tried to warn you niggas

Too much respect

Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam

It's so mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11?, what the fuck you guys scared of
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target

The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something
All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting
Y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand

All these haters sit and watch my climb wishing that it stop
I got a crown on my wrist and a crown on my top
And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man
Is this the game that I chose?
Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe
I got that Lee-Roy glow
Soul of an assassin and I'm trying to have me backed in
Off up in that corner but I'm off up in this bitch
Gold dangling all over
This W tat sweater and it's double M G
I ain't gonna be slept on forever
Tell the Sandman to wake em up and help me count this cheddar
Not enough hands on me
Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh
Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life
They said I would change, I'm just proving em right
I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more
Man, that don't sound right
But what it sound like is a good year for me
I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see
Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree
Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls
Now I'm the big man to beat
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
When you start shaking that tree
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
Look at me

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me
Blowing OG, I never socialize with police
Glock 40, never had it, why I'mma need it?
It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving
I ain't thugging, who the fuck is you mean-mugging?
I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales
Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort
Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public
Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing
Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder
Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died
I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage
Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise
They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie
Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win
That's the difference 'tween me and them

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana
Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr
Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma
Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under?
Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama
Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma
All these niggas snitching, witness perjury, Your Honor
Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college
Dope boy styling, DEA target
One point seven for these VS's on my collar
Born in the projects, now I'm known as the hottest
Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing

He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I grew 'em better
Like I'm under a goal post, I'm two official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said ""you winning, why BOA pray so much?""
I said ""you tripping, such winners make niggas pray on us""
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

Folarin in this ma'fucka
Still talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, oh, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don't be a statistic
How your main bitch sending me pictures?
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah nigga, I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If your a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back

This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole world, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young CO, L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga

Thinkin' I'm so glad that I can rap cause I can't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still
And a few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead

So fuck a 9 to 5, they clockin' and tryna to survive
Cop a brick and supply cause nobody offerin' jobs
Bricks build, buildings build, houses build neighborhoods
Better ripped than turned into a baller or a Davis shirt
Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic
Tryna see my gang and whippin' made me wish that I was flippin'
This college went out of his dollar pension
Cause after 4 or 5 you don't have nothing but college tickets

But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out (tryna work this out)
Countin' numbers up in my head tryna build this house (tryna build this house)
Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down

Look, little niggas will shoot you, they got nothing to say
Cause local celebrities only bout a brick away
If you still whip em he getting those from whippin' yay
And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight
Sneaker boxes, you can see your progress
And you weekend shoppin', show people no people problem
I can see the problem, you nigga don't have no conscience
Can't shoot, can't dribble, can't rap
Young nigga don't have no options

From a brick, to a stone, tryna feed for my homie
From the powder, turn to power, and the power turn to dough
Turning head with yo whip, Is it worth what you did?
If a brick is a brick from a brick you can build
From a brick to a stone, got a feign for a homie
Turn 2 into 4, turn reef to a home
Turn the powder, into power, and the power turn to hoes

Course I'm rappin' bitch but now I'm wrappin' bricks for 16
I was 17 ridin in that Lexus on 20's

While them niggas scared, we forever here
Hate to see you smile, money everywhere
Dream killers out, I see them in the rear
Before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer, amen

We ain't supposed to never have shit
We ain't supposed to never have
We ain't supposed to never have nothing
We ain't supposed to never have shit
See the growth in my rhymes
See my focus ain't on them

Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here
I reckon your barbershop talk of this
Heavenly father, may the spirit of God
Help whoever at odds get your guidance quick
All we need Keisha, all we need Becky
All we need is God, and fed free fetti
My little buddy look strong, young nigga peddle
He ain't make it in the leagues, so the streets wet him
Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather
Before see the jail again, he gonna see the devil
Been a week since he seen his mother
And 18 since he seen the other
I'mma pray for him
It's safe to say, he got some pain within
It ain't too much that I can say to him
'Cause my bank statement don't relate to him

We ain't supposed to never have nothing
We ain't supposed to never have shit
We ain't supposed to never have nothin'
See my focus ain't on them

I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene
Pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them ya'll seen
When I came through this bitch
Paper tagging on lean
Baddest bitch in the game
Nigga that was ya'll dream
Hold up, let me get a feel
Like Jack say hold up
I don't feel these niggas, nah
Hey Wallace

Yap, what's the problem? I'm focused
I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas
I ain't scared of these niggas
Getting higher than Shaquille O'Neal's field goal percentage
Yeah me nigga
Till the brokest nigga with got a mill plus interest
Meek keep living, get 'em

When I was dead broke used to always tell myself I'mma still be the shit
'Til my P.O she locked me up
I'mma do the time come home and still be this rich
Still see the bricks, I'mma still be a Mitch
Got these RICO shit tryna kill me and shit
Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit
Let me get the flow back, I was killing this shit
We was killing them strips, drop heads -- no ceilings and shit
Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things
300 and change got a million in whips, nigga

We ain't supposed to never have nothing
We ain't supposed to never have shit
We ain't supposed to never have nothing
See my focus ain't on them

Started from the bottom nigga
But now we grinding till the law come get us
For the money and them commas nigga
But can't forget about vagina nigga
Started from that bottom nigga
But now I got it it's a problem nigga
For that money and them dollars nigga
And I ain’t rich but I'm still shining nigga

Son of a mother studying at UDC
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys to seldom, you don’t get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever and know it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top

Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby

Yeah, my affinity grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

When the heat on niggas be like pyoom
Young nigga with some old riches
And the coldest women I be with weave on Necole Bitchie's
The broad let me I sweat it out like P90 get me doe

I don’t fantasize or bring thoughts up
See, see it’s on us
If it wasn’t for time then I would not rush
We could dump a cigar and beat the block up (roll up)
Making love run, make a heart bust
Say my words remind her of a harpoon
Her curves remind me of Starbucks
I get up for it, put it down on it
I done found an anomaly
Can tell that we about to beat
Come and climb the mountain until you finally
4Am, club done, dress down, fucked up
Text message saying “What’s up?”
And now what’s up, man tryna fuck

I feel the love I want don’t exist
But yet I’m still missing you
Can’t help but think about
What I really wanna do, to you (want it)
But I can’t help, I protect my heart (want it)
Cause you make me, want it (want it)
On the bed, on the floor, on the table baby

I got it, I got it, whenever you want it (whenever you)
Say my name and I’ll give you this loving (whenever you)
Break your body from sun down to morning (whenever you)
Do whatever you like, how you want it girl

Anywhere
You be the girl and, I’ll be your man and
You can have what you want, I’m on demand for you

'Cause you do it right
When you want it, you know that it’s nothing
I wanna give it to you
Anywhere you want it
Anywhere you want it
Anywhere, want it

Ain’t nothing better than them after party episodes
Man I kill that thing
So chill when I’m done better check her pulse
I perfect that stroke, so in turn can protect your heart
Lovely both sides works all
So we yearn for the lust right now
1 O’clock, 2 O’Clock, 3 O’Clock, yup
Got her like an untreated Vietnam vet
Give me your frame, I’ll make you my pic
Give me your skin I’ll give you my vest
Yes, I give you my word
Come close I give you that thorough
Make her share it with some other girls
But any time, anywhere know it’s all yours

I got it, whenever you want it (whenever you)
Say my name and I’ll give you this loving (I'll give you all this loving baby)
Break your body from sun down to morning (anything you want from me)

Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever

Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
But chase vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best

Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' all Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold blooded
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake

Might leave you niggas feetless

It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence?
If Jimmy got caught up, but you right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake friend, syndrome
There's no cure so your symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be somethin'
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this and that if you wanna get specific

Man these niggas ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
I used to pop blues with my lil' bitch
I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS
What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?
Oh no, these niggas ain't serious
Do you know what type of bitches I've been dealing with?
Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush
Used to use it to study until she fell in love
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
Told her ""Nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough""
Nah Nah Nah
These women ain't serious
She sprinkled a little something up in her lip
Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched
Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
But for now, they're wild
They rather get it in

Girls on drugs
Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough
They still need love

We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light

In her purse where her hand go
She disperse by the handful
Coco make her go up
Nothing popping, pop a zan when she laying low
Bars to break, so many bars to break
She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake
She like ""Oh my God, I'm on the moon and shit""
And my particular moon like a platoon and shit
You know the niggas I be dealing with
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip
And my position to give this shit to little kids
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic
We're all living with small demons
We're all sinning, it's all similar
Broads with us and they bong hitting
Let me tell you about the bitches I've been chilling with
The really insecure ones look good as shit
Nothing fill the void of a little pill
A little shot, she ain't shy when the shit spill
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
Beside that the lime light be so real
Let me tell you about the bitches that I kick it with
Told me nobody love her and so she cut her wrist
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close
That's why she want to get high because she's feeling low
Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke
So I could numb her insides and we will never know

Talked to the times when younger and made me get my life in order
Real in it for life, but now look at the price
But now look at that register, everything in here slight
Mmm, cause I'm john doing a hype
Look at how the moral of the story, but don't see its advice

Yeah, now salutations to my former friends
Forming to form against me is currently your form of defense

24 I had the city mad
Slim Charles in the Y now
You could say me and him brought the city back
Used to hustle in hand-me-downs
Now I'm whippin' the Camry 'round
Hit licks in Baltimore
Gettin' Hip-Hop chicken in like Kevin Liles
Uptown, I learned a lot
Suburbs taught me good
The white girl destroyed the black neighborhood
So white boys can run the world
White cops is goin' to war
I write thoughts and put 'em in songs
And the devil around the corner
It's all good cause the God is livin' in you
Cops can look in the bag
Tricky to man so can you read a mind
And they used to go to madness, and I ain't really have it
Somehow they let another Eddie advance
Well I shine for the niggas that passed
So my niggas in the pen got me pushin' a pad
Back in the crack era, daddy whippin' a cab
But now I'm pushin' a camper doin' a similar route
One time, [?] meets Jay Hov
Marion Berry meetin' with Barry O
This is Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry
This is bad brains from the go go

Tell the purist that laugh I don't reach out for daps
Cause ""No Hands"" triple platinum
Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?
Gettin' box office spins, only box I fit in
Is by thigh on a female
So they hatin' me for that, sayin' I just make women songs
It's perfect style every, versatile got me right where her walls at
Still know what my core needs, so fuck who ignores me
For I need niggas, I purchased 3 mirrors and show y'all what's for me

Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?

Hard to be friendly with women who've seen too many niggas
So I keep my circle small, you need reduction
Never too much friends, what is your circumference?
I swear to God, times is hard, but they're getting better
Tryna enjoy every moment, but see we so competitive
Gubana made the level, and I never missed a supper
But still my hunger's like a fucking model at a buffet
I'm with these broads who in love, they ain't seen any better
But dollar signs never mind, and he keep a zero
And if my heart could speak, it would talk to freaks
And leave the room when a nigga try to sleep with 'em
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly
Tell my niggas, I'ma get 'em if they gon' ride

Although I'm not who I'm destined to be

Just bought my homie a Roley simply to pass time
And on top it's lonely so keep your homies right by your side
And if life is short then we'll be the shorts of the Fab Five
Severed ties with any nigga who covet mine
And all the stunting got me looking ugly in momma's eyes
But I gotta do it, these niggas need provocative music
And as a youth momma worked too much to have an influence
Rapping and music, a bunch of bitches acting too foolish
You gotta be stupid, even Tim Allen had him a tooly
Getting high, sitting down, thinking out loud
It's a shame niggas lame, but I'mma hold it down
Let my bread roll, never let my friends go
That's why I let these dreads grow, I'll never fit your fucking crown
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly
Tell these niggas I'mma get 'em every other time
Young, wild niggas sit in your seat
Know every weekend every liquor for free
[?] believe, [?] bitch, I sow what I reap
Double M genius, make these bitches so deep
I make these niggas' opinion on younger lyricists consistently weak

It’s not your fault they try get me, cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself

Wrong, how dare I say ignore them
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more I'm wrong

Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go

Yeah, pride, pride, pride, gone know, my story
I've cut ties with y'all who ain't for me
It's over now, I found my lane, yeah
I got my mind on God and His glory

The vision and ambition
I guess I saw the sign like Ace of Bass, of just petitions
Hold up, my niggas
I really wanna getcha
But really had to figure out that image in the mirror
And the devil is callin', triple sixes in my call log
New phone, who this? No, you won't get him to fall off
Man, the two tone, six-two with the roof off
Get wrong, blue moon, mm-mm
'Cause we a bunch of all-stars
Yeah, used to think that we would all starve
Now, don't use the finger or fork when it's under full stop
Yeah, now I'm lyin', I got rhyming and source
If rap was a palette, I'm the rapper to
Ramadan y'all, sorry
Haters on me no way, they cold feet, I hot step
That's no, Ini Kamoze
And before you get to be poppin'
Probably got to see pay
Before you see the G-5, you'll probably fly Soul Plane
You probably go from oh Lord, to so-so, to okay
But, okay is dope, the ol' Lord, the blank face
What now? Wale

The devil want me to settle, I told that nigga never, no
Just know it's another level that they ain't really tellin' y'all
Somebody tried to tell me that the sky's my limit
Knowing that was only just to cloud my vision
Livin' in the city of get down, I laid down
What now?

And I done did about everything they said that I wouldn't do
I done played the game, played myself, and played the fool
Would you live without lights, the nicest clothes, and a plate of food?
You gon' take advantage of everything that's in front of you
Nigga, trust me, I know
I done stuck to my plan A from the go
'Cause a plan B's just killin' what ain't meant to be from the go
From always sellin' myself short to damn near sellin' out shows
From no diploma to bein' booked in colleges to perform
Nigga what now, still feel like I ain't got shit but I'm up now
I'm too close, they feel like I'm far away, I'm stuck now
In a high place, I'm the rock, though
I'm a gold mine with no silver spoon
I'm good enough to be the greatest man
But when I get there what's left to prove?
I promise I'm not scared of growth

What if a brother was ill enough to kill your fears

What if I told you, I just wanna hold you until I know you, 
When I'd rather know you before we go do what grown ups do, closed room, post honeymoon
Would you run away or run up to?
If I gave you the right of way, 
Would you give it up right away like that last scribble with that number two?
Shoot, let's have a sip for my affection 
And expand one on you on this new found friendships as we share and reciprocate with
Only difference with my particular curriculum is I'm here to lecture and listen, shawty, get it together
So you can take this as takin' me, takin' my charm, or take me by the hand or 
By the arm, now hold me tighter than a hope
Of this potential bond can be if you honestly ponderin', callin' on me
See right now, the only thing between us is makin' universe smile, 
Is what you want me to call you 10 hours after you give me them 10 numbers to dial
And if it's any consolation, I feel some type of havin' some type of honor 
In havin' a conversion with a number 10 right now

See you later, see if you love it
See you later, you can see some effort
I see you later, so, so much, you wanna see me forever

He took it too far, he treat them bullets like they Siamese""

My circle's small as a barber shop in a Rasta mansion

Wale,"Aye
Don't ask me about my love life
(Hol' up!)

It’s complicated to find a lady in my generation
That’s not preoccupied with social clout
We almost fazing out from the high we get from love and conversation to go on IG galavanting for likes and shit
Oh, it’s complicated
I’m tryna say I need loyalty like Clyde Barrow was tryna get when Bonnie was shot up riding shotgun with him
But my problems is just and I gotta admit
I got someone who loves me so effortless
But, I’m so messed up from another chick I feel like such a bitch ass nigga
That my exes got the power with no effort to decline the next shawty I get
So, I’m guarded and shit
But, never mind that 'cause you're a goddess and shit
What I’m tryna say is I like you but it’s complicated
Foundation on all my pillows, still your tender face is flawless when the sky kiss you
Should I bury you in compliments or buy gifts or
Just let you tell me bye and for that time I’ll miss you
My life is fairly complicated
You show too much of your heart I promise they confiscate it
I am young, black, and accomplished baby but
I’m not the type to bring home to mama
I’m just crazy 'cause I’m broad crazy
Monogamy’s kind of hard for me
When I start throwing them curves that’s when they caught feelings
I got famous at a young age I’m spoiled
I get paid, don’t go out so the club scene I’m bored of
I don’t believe in unicorns nor pure love, but more so the latter, seen Porzingis from courtside
I got missed calls from porn stars and church girls
You’d be surprised who get the wildest and squirt more

Let’s be honest shawty
I got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty
Don’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway
'Cause, if I really like you I don’t like your pictures, dig it?

I believe that love is complicated at best
And at it’s worst it’s a permanent burning in your chest
I pray to earn that from somebody someday
But, somehow someway I no longer have a heart to invest, it’s miles away
The smiles is fake and my job ain’t real
Why would you think I’ll find a woman who is?
I’m high today
Tomorrow I’m chill 'cause my job get real
What mature woman would put up with my shit?
I mean I’m damaged goods
I mean, I’m rather good at being just kind of good to women who deserve more from me
But, I see you as something more than a purring kitty
You hate my state of mind, somehow you think the world of me

It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
Just be honest shawty
I got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty
Don’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway

J'ai atteint la cour des grands j'avais même pas mué
J'ai appris à capter votre vice, j'ai appris à rester muet
J'ai appris à compter sur un banc, c'etait même pas mes billets

Bercé par l'chant des sirènes ou des compet' depuis l'berceau

So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low

Made promises in reverence
To save them for your reference

I know that I can heal
There's a blinding light
That no one else can see
Nobody no nobody but me
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh

Our pens had found the bottom line
The past that had me paralyzed
And all my future analyzed

Will it turn a wicked tide?
Or be a ghost that keeps us up at night?

Trying to make pay

Take a walk in the waves

Working on a buzz
Keeping my drink in the shade

And her body couldn't be found

Walker Hayes,"Rode all the way down memory lane where 65 ends
Wonderin’ how it’d feel to see the one that got away again
Hopin’ it might go down like that hometown unanswered prayer
My hero sang about on an old burned CD we shared

Somethin' on the interstate told me I was headed straight for your pretty storm
That the hurt was still gonna be there just like your name on my arm
Even got real with a girl I chill with up in Chapel Hill
Told her you were gonna be here just in case my heart was still in Mobile

I said baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
I said baby, why do you have to be so beautiful

Ain’t no tellin’, girl, how long it’s been since we did all that shoutin'
Prolly, ten months twenty-seven days, somethin’ like that but hey, who’s countin’
Oh, you know, just livin’ the dream, home is where the bus is
I could say time looks fine on you but 
It wouldn’t do it justice
It wouldn’t do it justice

I said baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
I said baby, why do you have to be so beautiful

I don’t think your stomach’s supposed to hurt quite like this
When you run into a girl you forgot you missed
It’s like the space between us only made me numb
Thought I could just see you and be okay but I’m not okay girl
Tell me that smile on your face is so fake
And that It’s all comin’ back, comin’ back, comin’ back
I just have to ask, have to ask, have to ask

Sometimes I still wanna get messed up
But you'd be proud of me

Sole survivor of my last all-nighter
In the back of the bottom shelf
It's gonna be there in the morning

You're the reason I quit drinking

I still look out for the cops when I'm driving around town
And I'm still not quite sure what to do with my hands in a crowd
There's a lot I can't remember and a lot I can't forget

Walker Hayes,"Before I even learned to play a note, I was on stage
Mastering the art of selling myself at a young age
Fear and insecurity drove me like a Maserati
High school was like showing up at a costume party
I was a comedian, an athlete
A golden boy, a black sheep
Whatever I had to be to make the world throw candy at me
And college was the same act, different play
It was October 31st every day
And the real world was an all too familiar street
Another trick, another treat

Then I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
And it was like

Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

Hell, I don’t know why I’m like this
But what would it change if I knew
Maybe my parents messed up
But, hey, they’re just dressed up kids too
Maybe I guess what I’m trying to say is I love you
For being somebody I’m not ashamed to introduce my skeletons to
I still put on my Superman cape and hide in it
But when I’m with you it comes untied for a minute
Hits the ground in the shadow of your skin
For the first time I was comfortable in mine

When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
It was like

Walker Hayes,"I met Craig at a church called Redeeming Grace
It's like he understood my ""I don't want to be here"" face
I felt out of place and I smelled like beer
But he just shook my hand, said ""I'm glad you're here""
He says ""we'll all be judged""
But he was never judgemental
And even though my songs don't belong in no hymna
He'd quote me my lyrics, slap me on the back
Said ""Man you've got a gift! How you write like that?""

Yeah I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday School, right?
I still ain't figured out church yet
But Craig, I get
Nah he can't walk on water, turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Now he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is

When you lose a record deal, yeah all the perks fade fast
Dealership said, ""We're going to need to get that mini-van back""
So we were down to one car
And broke as I felt
My wife and six kids and only five seat belts
I needed help but couldn't admit I was struggling 
Said, ""Craig, it's all good""
But he knew it all wasn't
A ""Hey man I'm praying for you"" would've been sufficient but nah
He took roadside assistance to a whole other level
To sacrificial heights

Showed up at the ballpark after my son's game one night
In two cars, with his wife Laura watching from the other
I said ""What in the world are y'all doing here, brother?""
He just laughed inside that old Chrysler Town and Country van
With the keys, and a title, and a pen in his hand
Said ""Man, all you got to do is sign and it's yours""
I said ""No, no way""
But he wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer
He said ""Please do
Somebody did this for me once, just let me do this for you""
We argued about it for a little while
Then I teared up, and Craig smiled

Yeah I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday school, right?
Nah he can't walk on water, or turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Now he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is

My pride was way too ashamed to be adequately grateful at the moment
But I signed the dotted line, and I drove the kids home
And when the cop pulled up beside us
At the light, they didn't have to duck
Because thanks to Craig
They were all buckled up",Craig,2017

Didn't see the belt buckle or the blade slip
And I remember when the doctor did it up with a stitch
Funny thing...still got a scratch that I can't itch where my thumb was
Now I've brought the same piece of chicken in a bag to work everyday
For the last twenty years or so
And I really don't mind, work assembly line
Got an intercom blasting the news and the latest on the baseball scores
Come around every Friday, well I get a paycheck
Take the same road home that I come to work on, heck, it's a living
And I got another factory at home
Got a barbeque, pink mustang, fenders chrome
And at nine o'clock I sit there in my chair
And I don't know why I lose my hair
And then I go to / and then I go to / and then I go to sleep
Well I like to know what I'm doing when I do it
And I do what I'm doing 'cause I don't know what to do when I'm not doing it
Sometimes I remember as a boy my father told me I could grow up
To be anything I really wanted to be / anything
And everyday at lunch I still look for my lost digit
Still got that funny scratch, so maybe when I find it I can itch it
And I got a little rubber pool in the backyard for the kids to wade in
And i....i...i...i...i...i?

As the bus hit brakes and the words heat up
About money time and remembered slights

Packed so close and packed so tight

Undermined he overloads 
Over all he does and all she owes

Even though they were the pair

And you saw them everywhere

There was an ocean in their bed
From the punches pulled 
And the faces smacked
Branded by the words they said
But they were drawn by the thorns
The dew and the lace
As they ran their hands 
And wet their face
In their garden's 
In a secret place
In paradise at Eden's gates
But even that couldn't save them
From all that came before
Two years and nights 
A thousand fights 
They were far beyond a cure

This business of love will never do
Not for me and not for you 
This business of love will never die
Not for you and not for I
This business of love will never do

Wall of Voodoo,"It's automatic 
When I talk to old friends, 
The conversations 
Turn to girls we knew 
When their hair 
Was soft and long. 
And the beach 
Was the place to go.

The sun-tanned bodies 
And the waves of sunshine
California girls 
And the beautiful coastline...
The warmed up weather, 
Let's get together and 
Do it again.

Now I've been thinking 
About all the places 
We surfed and danced, 
And all the faces 
We missed so 
Let's get back together and 
Do it again.

Looks good at twilight
...Makes your nighttimes warm and outta sight...

Wall of Voodoo,"It was 1957, Evlis Presley came in the 
Spanish restaurant where Dora was working.
Dora took the order, bussed the plates, 
Poured the coffee as the party ate.
Col. Tom paid the check and Elvis Presley 
Left the tip, a brand new Cadillac....

And the Gods I loved were poor white trash.
One was making wine in Canaan, the other 
Tipping waitresses Cadillacs...

Twenty years later when Elvis died she parked 
The Caddy in the drive. With plaster statues, 
Lights, and stands she called her front yard 
PRESLEY LAND. She said he was just a poor man's 
Son who never forgot where he'd come.
Now that he is dead and gone she shares 
Her gift with everyone....

And the Gods I loved were poor white trash.
One was making wine in Canaan, the other 
Tipping waitresses Cadillacs...

The landlord had all he could stand.
Better cash was close at hand.
The land, the land, the land was in demand.
""Down the way they're selling German cars.
British clothes to movie stars.
We can kick the Spanish out for good, 
Rejuvenate the neighborhood. I'm the laughing 
Stock of all my friends, with that crazy old 
Woman and her Presley Land...""

When she was left with nothing, she said 
""They sold my house, can't get it back, 
Could hardly raise the cash if I sold 
My Cadillac...even if I could do that.""

Wall of Voodoo,"He got the high sign so he jumped a bus
And along the roads that wind on through
The hot Mojave and the Jericho 
He'd start his whole life anew
And what he'd left behind he hadn't valued
Half as much as some things 
He never knew

He got dropped off on a street in town
Where a grey old man looked him up and down and said
""Son this ain't no western movie matinee
And you're a long way off from yippee yi yay
Cause I can tell at a glance 
You're not from 'round these parts
Got a green look about ya
And that's a gringo for starts
Sometimes the only thing a western savage understands
Are whiskey and rifles and an unarmed man like you.""
""So you gotta keep on the move
And don't let that fancy paint fool you.""

And then the old-timer pulled him close and said,
""You've come a long way, I know
You got a longer drive ahead
Through the bones of a buffalo
Through the claims of the western dead
And just like the spokes of a wheel 
You'll spin 'round with the rest,
You'll hear the drums and the brush of steel,
You'll hear the call of the west."" 
Call of the west

(The conflict)
Harshly awakened by the sound of six rounds 
Of light caliber rifle fire followed minutes 
Later by the booming of nine rounds from a 
Heavier rifle
But you can't close off the wilderness
He heard the snick of a rifle bolt and found 
Himself peering down the muzzle of a weapon 
Held by a drunken liquor store owner
""There's a conflict,"" he said. 
""There's a conflict between land and people
The people have to go.
They've come all the way out here to make mining 
Claims, to do automobile body work, to gamble.
To take pictures, to not have to do laundry, to 
Own a mini-bike, to have their own cb radios and
Air conditioning, good plumbing for sure, and to 
Sell time life books and to work in a deli, to 
Have some chili every morning and maybe, maybe 
To own their own gas stations again and to take 
Drugs and have some crazy sex, but above all, 
Above all to have a fair shake, to get a piece of the 
Rock and a slice of the pie and to spit out 
The window of your car and not have the wind blow 
It back in your face.""

Now from the high timber line to the deserts dry
Who'll risk dangling on some hangman's tree
To stake their claims on these prairie plains
While they say this lunch is not had for free?
Just like the spokes of a wheel 
Who'll spin 'round with the rest?
They'll hear the drums and the brush of steel
And I'll hear the call of the west

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

You've filled my heart with weary old blues

In a foreign land?

Wallen,"Refrain :
My Baby is a hero no matter what he shows 
He’s so much better than he knows
I know he goes to trouble
Fightin’ in this jungle
From one failure to the next
When he stares into space
I can see I can feel his pain
Tryin’ to drag him
So far out far out from me 
But my Baby is  a hero no matter what he shows 
He’s so much better than he knows
I know he goes to trouble
Fightin’ in this jungle
My life without him will be meaningless

Et si tu ne me reconnais pas te reconnais-tu
Lorsque tu vois ce que nous sommes devenus
Et si mon image dit tu ne peux y refléter la tienne
C’est que l’obscur de ton regard noircît notre lumière
Alors tous les soirs lorsque je chante « C’est pas moi c’est les Autres »
Je me dis que c’est pas si simple que ça de reconnaître ses fautes
Le monde est ainsi fait n’est-ce pas 
Mais peut-il réellement se faire sans nous peut-il réellement se faire sans toi 

Refrain

Et si tu ne te reconnais pas comment me reconnaîtrais-tu
C’est vrai ça qu’est-il donc advenu
Pour qu’on finisse comme si nous étions étrangers
On a tellement pris appui sur nos vanités
Éternellement Adam et Eve nous sommes
Les cœurs se brisent et lentement s’additionnent
Le monde est ainsi fait n’est-ce pas
Mais peut-il réellement se faire sans nous peut-il réellement se faire sans toi

Refrain",Mon Amour,
Wallen,"Je te présente la solitude
Celui-là il t'emmènera sillonner la Banlieue-Sud
Elle snobe mes habitudes
Tu ne vois que sa caisse quand elle repart
Que ses jantes quand elle se gare
Tu te jettes dans le vide quand t'es au-bord de son regard
Toute les langues du monde ne pourraient combler son silence
Faudra meubler le néant jusqu'à la clé de sa conscience
Et j'en perdrais le sens de ma définition
C'est comme séparer les problèmes de leurs solutions
Je l'ai vu tenir la chandelle, lors d'une friction
Le sourire de mes fistons
Lui donne toujours des frissons
J'en ai la chaire de poule quand elle caresse ma douleur
Son amour me fait mal à m'en mordre le cœur
Malgré nous le temps nous attache aux séquelles
Renvoi des flashs
Comme un ex-pilote de chasse, traumatisé par un crash
De la foule, elle me déshabille du regard, elle se lâche
Comme les junky, mon stylo la shoot et la soulage

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

Ma solitude ne sort pas de l'imagination
?
Tu peux fouiller dans ma voix
Tu ne trouveras que des vérités
Car le jumeau de la fiction n'est autre que la réalité
J'ai l'impression qu'elle est venue au monde avec moi
Qu'elle a grandi avec moi
Qu'elle voyage avec moi
Qu'elle prend de l'âge avec moi
Qu'elle s'engage au mariage avec moi
Qu'elle rit et pleure avec moi
Qu'elle vit et meurt avec moi
Plus t'es riche, plus elle te michetonne 
Tu l'affectionnes
À trop vouloir la maquiller son charme te mitonne
T'as beau la tromper elle reste fidèle
Tu vis d'elle
Te vide sur elle en cellule comme dans une chambre d'hôtel
Elle console, recolle les morceaux des cœurs brisés
Son fantôme resurgit pour fait payer les pots cassé
Maniaque active, jour et nuit insomniaque
Manipulatrice, elle rend aigri, paranoïaque

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

J'honore la solitude des mitards des GAV
Des paraplégiques des écartés atteints du HIV
Des veuves aux sourires aussi forcés
Que les mariages des mères que les pères ont dû divorcer
Une pensée pour la solitude des orphelins
Des sans-abris ni soutiens
Des oubliés qui tournent en cash comme des félins
La solitude t'observe du fond d'un wagon ou sur un banc
Elle adopte pour seul ami une bouteille ?
Ces compagnons se comptent que sur la moitié d'une main
Leur entente ne tient que sur ce triste point en commun
Je cherche réponses aux questions
Dans une glace du balcon
Des nuages à l'horizon
Du carrelage au plafond
La main dans le caleçon, la tête ailleurs quand on me parle
Traîne tard dans le brouillard
À Broyer du noir pour aller nulle part
Je suis le fruit que le temps a fait mûrir
Que personne n'a cueilli à défaut de pourrir
Comme un millionnaire entouré de timpes
Sous une tente un futur mort séquestré
Calibrer à la tempe pour se détendre
La solitude fume boit jusqu'à t'oublier
Et à l'usure elle s'enlise avec toi dans le sablier 

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

Les chemins que j'ai pris dans ma vie
Et mon métier m'oblige à te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur

Burn a bridge,
I've burned of all them for the one night stands and the two faced friends.
Burn a bridge,
Burn a bridge,
That sticks for the wine,
Now sing to the bottom,
I'm a take my time.

If I die tonight,
Bury my bones in the burbon and mud down below.
All the first world problems of all the sad souls,
Drinkin windex and rum with their coworker bros.

But that wasn't me,
No I never gave up.
And my cup's colored rose for every girl that I love.
And when the sun eats the earth then we'll all turn to dust,
So who really cares that we drink way,
Way too,
Way,
Way too much?",WHO RLY CRS,2013

I'm out of lines, girl, We're not getting any smoother than this 
But could you blame me if I, if I, if I
Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie 

Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts 
Donate now to my rightful 'cause
But what good is a quick healing to go? 
If the lesson is never learned it's just like stitches for show 

They say the Carolina heat 
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat 
But don't discount their winter winds 
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in 
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes 
Our only choice was to swallow pride 
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest

We're at the ground floor 
But our numbers they only get higher from here 
It's not the failure, but the cost of success 
Is the thing I can't help but fear 

This isn't righteous 
It's a mid-life crisis 
I'm not compelled 
You just convinced me to write this 
It's for the greater good 
'Cause I'd rather be great than good

Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling 
Your skin is just peeling off!

Walls of Jericho,"I stare as my weak knees wilt 
Longing trying to touch the embrace that has left me 
And I had you 
And your kindness was there 
Now pieces of you hate me 
I am not a portrait on your heart no more 
But I still kiss the feelings that emerge from my pulse 
And memories seep from my eyes 
Knowing that love has gone further 
Than my soft hand can reach 
The utmost apology is what I can lay on your face but 
Will you still swallow me whole? 
Nothing can compare 
And you continue to dance in me 
And I continue to bleed 
But nothing can compare 
I have killed the one thing that exceeds my existence",Angel,1999
Walls of Jericho,"Now I feel my tears shredding through my skin 
My convictions seep into my open wounds 
As the idea you've pressed on me 
Are the fears that I bury within my 

Distorted thoughts as this tear runs down 
My structured face 
Images of your impulsive greed 
Shreds my existence 

As your hands give life to the razors that 
Slice my violated throat 
How to comprehend that nightmare 
You so willingly 

Helped me fall in debt 
To what appeased you? 
Answer me that 
Piece by piece it slowly deteriorates 
My sanity if any is left",Beneath the Exterior,1999
Walls of Jericho,"Intertwined thoughts with yours 
Stitched up wounds are open once again 
Appreciation of my silence 
Will be held no more 

So close to your desires 
But I will not encourage my blood 
To be spilled for indignity 
And I would cry 

But it would kill all that I know 
Still utter deceit enters my flesh 
And I contemplate the end 
As I grasp for breath 

Bearing bloody memories while 
Kneeling down letting my insides pour out 
And my enraged memories won't let me open 
These wounds anymore",Family Values,1999
Walls of Jericho,"Why is it that we open 
Our flesh based statue to 
Minds that easily forget? 
I remain torn from the hand 

That I would have placed on my inviting face 
We sacrifice what brought us down 
To indulge in the unknown 
When you meant that much to me 

So did the words that were 
Released from your lips 
But you weren't there 
So I'll pride myself in knowing 

Your false proclamation 
As I build this wall once again 
What is left? 
The fragments coated in sorrow 

An acknowledged entrapment 
I am here to strike you down upon your disgust 
I will marvel in the glorified defeat",Full Disclosure,1999
