Sheryl Crow,"He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see his face
He takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Sweet child
Where do we go now

Where do we go
Where do we go sweet child
Where do we go now [Repeat until end]",Sweet Child O' Mine,1998

One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after

(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
I should be happy

I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done

Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

I spend each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out

I was riding on the E-train
I was whistling to the rhythm
I was thinking about my live-in
I was feeling pretty fine
I asked the time
Got a poke in the eye

When I read the latest news
How we can't believe he wore those shoes
Should we have the man impeached
Or should we shoot him in the foot
Well you waste my time, you waste my time
Looking for two hundred ways to hang a guy

Then more taxation
National past time is aggravation

Just for a while

To avoid all that's distracting
Like newspapers and magazines
Insipid propagandizing
To tell me what a loser I've elected
But you've neglected to tell the truth
That your politics is tied around his foot
And we too are dangling

Low I.Q., that we are lazy
That we sit here watching sitcoms
That we have no clue to what is going on
Well you got that wrong

Wait and see, the boom will fall
The morning eggs will hit the wall
And everyone I know will call
To say that change is hanging in the air
You'd best beware

Well you'll wake up and
Average Joe is in your chair
Just because he'd kinda
Like to do what's right

The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore.

I made up the bed we sleep in.
I looked at the clock when you creep in.
It's 6 AM and I'm alone.

Did you know when you go it*s the perfect ending,
To the bad day I was just beginning.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake.

Your friends act sorry for me.
They watch you pretend to adore me.
But I am no fool to this game.

Now here comes your secret lover,
She'll be unlike any other,
Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Did you know when you go it*s the perfect ending,
To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending.
When you go, all I know is you*re my favorite mistake
You*re my favorite mistake.

Well maybe nothing lasts forever,
Even when you stay together.
I don't need forever after, but it*s your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way.

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?

How did we get this far
Baby

No moon in the sky
No roof to keep us dry
Looks like rain tonight
I got a sinking feeling

Coming over me
I got a sinking feeling
I tried to paint a picture
A picture through the clouds for you

Green, your smiling eyes
Red, cause I made you cry
Grey, these rainy skies
Tomorrow will be blue
Stay love
Stay tonight
These rainy skies
Tomorrow will be blue

No caffeine in the coffee
No sugar in my tea
Just watching the TV
With the sound down 
No radio on
No tune to the song
And the words are wrong
Your fingers tapping
To the rhythm of the rain
Your fingers

I tried to paint a picture
A picture through the clouds for you

I got a sinking feeling
Coming over me
I got a sinking feeling
I tried to paint a picture
A picture through the clouds for you

Don't say goodbye

When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don`t know what I've done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done and I`m feeling so ashamed

Then an angel appeared she was just 17

And dig your grave

Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise- loves- to go down
Lousy lovers- pick their prey

But they never cry out loud
Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love

Is it over now- do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home.
Rock on- ancient woman
Follow those who pale

In your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

Always burned a hole in my pants
Never get to school mama happy baby
But always blew a second chance

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I never took candy from strangers
Never wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me happy
Come on baby, keep me happy

Never got a flash out of cocktails
Never had a flesh off the bone
I never got a lift out of Lear Jets baby
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, keep me happy
Won't you keep me happy

Sheryl Crow,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Sheryl Crow,"In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves",White Room,1999
Sheryl Crow,"I woke up and called this morning,
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore.

I made up the bed we sleep in.
I looked at the clock when you creep in.
It's 6 AM and I'm alone.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I was just beginning.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake.

Your friends are sorry for me.
They watch you pretend to adore me.
But I am no fool to this game.

Now here comes your secret lover,
She'll be unlike any other,
Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake.

Well maybe nothing lasts forever,
Even when you stay together.
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way.

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong.

Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?
Now you're my favorite mistake
Yeah you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake",My Favorite Mistake [Live at Central Park],1999
Sheryl Crow,"He's got a smile
And it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky

And now and then when I see his face
It takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, ooh oh, sweet child 'o mine
Oh, oh oh oh sweet love of mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Ooh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Little bird, what's troubling you
You know what you have to do
What is yours you'll never lose

Beneath the promise of blue skies
With broken wings we'll learn to fly
Pull yourself out of the tide
And begin the dream again

Good morning, I'm leaving
And I'll be back in a few days

Torn up and tied... you free me
When life is strange ­you take me

Standing round the candlelight
In the middle of this blizzard
You stood and melted all the ice

It will have been
Worth the ride
You were master of so many
Savior to none
I waged all of my hopes so plenty on you
Now look what I've become

And if you see me could you free me with a smile

I found you standing there
When I was seventeen
Now I'm thirty-two
And I can't remember what I'd seen in you
I made a promise
Said it everyday
Now I'm reading romance novels
And dreaming of yesterday

And slow dance underneath the stars
I'd like to watch the sun come up
In a stranger's arms

They've still got me crawling on the floor

Don't lead me on

I'm better off alone

Throwing diamonds at your feet 
Drifted around you like a satellite 
I gave you everything you need 
Everything you need

Keeps me yearning and yearning 

How can you turn and walk away 
Pretending everything's okay 
How can you turn your back

How can you just break away

Even when they don't hold water, you try to keep them safe and dry
An' trade your moan for a positive tone,
Reassured by ads about things you own,
And so we go through this again,
In love, in love with your beautiful pain

If everything went runnin' smoothly,
You'd soon lose who you were
Oh, the pain and hurt, for that's your real,
So go on, go back to her

You packed up all your troubles, you let me play the bars
And hiked out to the meadows and lay down on the fragrant moss
Put down your own tree, then meticulously,
Built a cross right there and stared back at me

That every man could be free

That he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she's need to carry on
He taught her how to

Baby run

Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
so long
Baby loves to run

She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain
She's searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on

So run baby run baby run baby run

It brings back the sound of music so tender, 
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, 
It brings back a memory ever green. 
I'm with you once more under the stars, 
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying 
When they begin the beguine. 
To live it again is past all endeavor, 
Except when that tune clutches my heart, 
And there we are, swearing to love forever, 
And promising never, never to part. 
What moments divine, what rapture serene, 
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted, 
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted, 
I know but too well what they mean; 
So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember; 
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine. 
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you, 
Till you whisper to me once more, 
Darling, I love you! 
And we suddenly know What heaven we're in, 
When they begin the beguine

To the bad day I was just beginning
When you go all I know is you're my favorite mistake

Your friends act sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

Now here comes your secret lover
She'll be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending
When you go all I know is you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

Well maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong
Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?

Now you're my favorite mistake
Yeah you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake",My Favourite Mistake [Live],2004

I still want to have some fun
I want to leave you feeling breathless

You can page me all night long

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

But every now and then you come to mind
'Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
But when your name was called, you found a place to hide
When you knew that I was always on your side

Well everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
But your demons and your angels reappeared
Leavin' all the traces of the man you thought you'd be
Leavin' me with no place left to go from here
Leavin' me so many questions all these years

But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally
This isn't how it's really meant to be
No it isn't how it's really meant to be

Well they say that love is in the air, but never is it clear,
How to pull it close and make it stay
Butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away
And I'm left to carry on and wonder why
Even through it all, I'm always on your side

But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are we left to wonder, all alone, eternally
But is this how it's really meant to be
No is it how it's really meant to be

Well if they say that love is in the air, never is it clear
How to pull it close and make it stay
If butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away

Every time you give your love away

Driving in a Pontiac,
Just about to lose my mind.
I was going to Arizona,
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine.

My mother says I'm crazy,
My baby calls me lazy,
But I'm gonna show them all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and
I don't need no more damn schoolin'.
I was born to just walk the line.

Living on Tulsa time.
Living on Tulsa time.
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it.
Living on Tulsa time.

So there I was in Hollywood,
Thinking I was doing good,
Talking on the telephone line.
They don't want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs;
My mama says my baby's doing fine.

So then I started winking,
Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time.
That I had no bussiness leaving,
And nobody would be grieving;
You see I'm on Tulsa time.

Living on Tulsa time.
Living on Tulsa time.
Gonna set my watch back to it

I was blinded by the dark

And the youngest of hearts has grown

I dream we're happy in my sleep
Floating down and down and down

And the tide rushes by where we stand
And the earth underneath turns to sand
And we're waiting for someone to see
Don't bail on me

Tell ma I loved a man
Even though I turned and ran
Lovely and fine I could have been
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Staying down in the palm of his hand

Sheryl Crow,"She was born in November 1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That everyone could be free

So her mama got high high high
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places

Where he knew that she´d belong
He failed and taught her young
The only thing she´d need
To carry on
He taught her how to

Run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
Past the arms familiar
And their talk of better days

To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long
Baby loves to run

She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting

Through the pouring rain
She´s searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she pictures all the places

Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on

So run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
From the old familiar faces and
Their old familiar ways

To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long

And London suffered sweltering heat
And the gangs of Mini Coopers

For no more trucks and no more cars
They threw cans of petrol through the windows at Scotland Yard

Without disturbing their high tea

And driven through the streets of Agra to the palace aqua duct

Was just a target for the angry

Standing guard on my front drive

I'll try to remember
Exactly who I am

Free to make a mess of everything

But I got pricked by the thorns
And on a long cold night
I still think I'm bleeding
But I wake up untorn

Well I am a missing person
I've lost it all but my name
And, I'm afraid some long lonely road
Will lead me back to you again

I am free, yeah

There's a chain around your mind
When something is holding you tightly

Can't you see that we've really bought into
Every word they proclaimed and every lie, oh

If we could only get out of our heads, out of our heads
And into our hearts
If we could only get out of our heads, out of our heads
And into our hearts

Someone's feeding on your anger
Someone's been whispering in your ear
You've seen his face before
You've been played before

Through the dawn of darkness blindly
You have blood upon your hands
All the world will treat you kindly
But only the heart can understand, oh understand

Let them be
Let them go

Oh, every prophet just a man

Let every man bow to the best in himself

We're the wisest ones, everybody listen

Visions of delight revealing
Breathes a pure and holy feeling

Though I roam a minstrel lonely
All through the night
My true harp shall praise sing only
All through the night

Love's young dream alas is over
Yet my strains of love shall hover
Near the presence of my lover
All through the night

Hark, a solemn bell is ringing
Clear through the night
And thou my love art heavenward winging

Soul immortal shalt thou awaken
With thy last dim journey taken

In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler.
We were poor but we had love, 
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines.
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.
Mommy rocked the babies at night,
And read the Bible by the coal oil light,
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, 
To complain, there was no need,
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair.
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog,
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,
I remember well, the well where I drew water.
The work we done was hard,
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

May you find some comfort there 
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

But I know my heart's not ready yet

I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

She don't have to look just like you
No her eyes don't have to be that blue
It's hard to give someone a chance
When you can't get past that second dance

I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

Sometimes the pain is dulled to numb
And I can't believe how far I've come

I can walk into a room without you
(I can breathe without you)
And I, I don't get drunk and talk about you no more, no more
(And I can sleep without you)
So I, I guess I've learned to live without you
(I can be without, I can be without you)
I just don't know how to love without you
(I don't know how, I don't know how)
See, see I, I had to learn to live without you
(I had to learn to live without you)
Oh but I just don't know how to, how to love, how to love without you
(Oh I just don't know, how to love, how to love without you)

It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

Oh, she can hit it to the ground and drop it low
I've been waiting all week to get to know
Oh, just how to make a move, I

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

Tell me, is it easier to see
That I don't want nobody else for you and me
Minutes later and I'm racing to your door
I never wanted someone's touch like this before

And if she wants to
We can hold each other's hands just that slow
Oh, she can hit it to the ground and drop it low
I've been waiting all week to get to know
Oh, just how to make a move, I

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I feel your skin connect to mine
It's at the top of anything that I could want
I let it take all my time
Nothing else I want, nothing on my mind

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side",Touch,2014
Shifty,"[Chorus:] 

These other girls, have been there too, 
Nothin' that I wouldn't do, for you, for you, 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on 

[Verse 1:] 

Now I've never had the feelin' that I get from you, 
It's hard to believe but I know it's true, 
You leave me breathless, you're precious, you're beautiful in every way, 
At first I second guessed it but our love won't fade, 
Every day I grow closer, with every word you say, 
Me and you have got something that no one's taking away, 
There were times that I thought I was in love before, 
I've been let down, I'm less now, shifty's got an angel and it's all for you, 
It's all for you, I ain't worried cause you know exactly what to do, 
And when everything's wrong you make it all ok, 
I come home stressed and you take it away, 
It's the little things you do, that mean so much, 
I need your love, your kiss, your touch, 
And it never gets old, I still feel the rush, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2:] 

Now there's me and you, and everyone else, 
I remember when I used to only think about myself, 
But you changed that fast, love is changing me, 
I used to be a playa then we came to be, 
True chemistry, I believe you're my destiny, 
Cause I'm free when you're next to me, 
You're a lady in the living room, a freak in the bedroom, 
Oh so for real when I'm bumpin' to neck tunes, 
You can nibble on my neck, don't stop too soon, 
Let me know before you cum so I can cum with you, 
This is sexual healin', and I'm a sex fiend, 
So let's stay together like my name was Al Green, 
Yea, I got you, like I told you so, 
I'ma hold you in my arms and never let go, 
And at first I smiled, and then you blushed, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3:] 

The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on, 
The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on.

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling
Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky Dicky star speckles and pink butterflies and life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise, I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ

Like the record spins on the trails we blaze, the walls are closing in but that's okay
Because I've been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good
I'm on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweat box, laser beams, flashing lights, you've got to feel the rush
Feel the spice of life, love life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icing, mesmerizing, the minds are sick ones, cause what we are is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun; come on the fun is just begun

Shifty,"CHORUS:
I can't believe I'm fallin' so hard for you
we've known eachother so long
all along i've been out lookin' for somethin'
when somethin' was you all along

I used to look to you as a friend
the one I'd call when i felt like my life was 'bout to end
when the sky is fallin' down and the walls are closing in
inside i need a friend so i'm callin' you again
oh can ya lift me up because i feel so down
I'm lost in my head i feel used but refuse to believe that love is dead
cause you gave me all the signs but i was blind
my third eye sees you now
i keep lookin' up and leavin' believin' this one's right
but that one just ain't my type or height
see I'm not tryin' to waste my life or sit back and watch as
it races by cause what I'm lookin' for is a love that's true
i never thought it was you and i don't know why
i always thought it was her that I'd find her for sure
but I'm a little too old to be actin' immature

CHORUS

your the one that loves me and your the one that cares
and girl your the one that will always be there
se i've looked high and i've looked low
for the girl that i had right under my nose
and goes to show you really never know
so i turned around and found my way back to your front door
and i don't think we can be just friends anymore
I'm here to let you know i let the other girls go
i hope you feel like i feel cause i swear that somethin's real
and its tearin' me apart now I'm an owner of a lonely heart
so if i wish upon a star we could live a fairy tale
I'm not afraid to try and I'm not afraid to fail
i made up my mind this time you took the scale
now let my lips touch your lips keep it down girl 
cause i wouldn't want you to miss this for the world

my third eye sees you now

(music...)

girl you can keep me in a stay 
girl you just take my breath away
your more than just a friend to me
so you can have your way (your way your way)

lets say that we were meant to be
if we don't try we'll never see
believe and take a chance with me
so you can have your way (your way your way)

CHORUS",All Along,2004
Shifty,"I wish we could live forever
But everyone dies
Everyone laughs 
And everyone cries

I'll be mad but I'm glad
You were part of my life
Make sure you stop by my dreams
When I'm sleepin' at night

Now a piece of my heart 
Is lookin' down from the sky
Like an angel on my shoulder
Helpin' me to get by

And all the words that you told me 
Were the words of the wise
To navigate my path 
Through the drama and lies

[Chorus]
I won't forget you
And I'll keep on loving you
Buts its hard to live my life
When you are not around
I'll try and make it through
I know you want me to
But its hard to think of you
Without me breakin' down
I know your in a better place
I know you finally feel the pain
I miss you my best friend
I'll never find someone like you again

I try to stay optimistic 
But it hurts so bad
For me to lose the best friend
That I probably ever had

Now every day that I wake
I see how precious life is
Maybe someday you'll come back
As one of my kids

It's crazy things change
How hard life can be
I remember we were young
Everything seemed so easy

I had you by my side 
And I thought you'd never leave me
And even though your gone
You still never will believe me

[Chorus]

Were born to live
And we live to die
Walk on the ground
And soar through the sky

And were born to live
And we don't ask why
Transcend and reside
When stone angels cry

Were born to live
And we live to die
Walk on the ground
And soar through the sky

And were born to live
And we don't ask why
Transcend and reside
When stone angels cry

[Chorus]

(Were born to live and we live to die)
I know your in a better place
(Were born to live and we don't ask why)
I know you finally feel the pain

Is easy cause your beautiful
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Come on
Now girl your beautiful
So beautiful
It tears me up like what

No matter how
How much I get it 
Never seems to be enough

We've had our
Ups and downs
Our highs and lows
And everytime we fight it's like more of the juice exposed

But you know
That's just they way love goes
If I wasn't passionate about it
Baby then I wouldn't explode

Oh, oh temper temper
Well here we go again
Cause I'm your lover, your protector
And your very best friend

There ain't a doubt in my mind
That we were meant to be
Baby girl your so fine
Feel my frequency

I want you next to me
For the rest of my life
I'm singin' no more lonely nights
Like Bob Marley

Everything is gonna be alright
Said I want you by my side
'Til the day that I die
We can drink get high

We can dance all night
Under the moonlight
Tongue and cheek 
I got you freakin' on me

Baby please

Now when the sky is fallin' down
Girl I found that your the cure
'Cause your the only thing that's real
When I'm feelin' insecure

You're always there for me
When I need someone to care for me
Apparently you made the right move
Rather carefully

So till the end I'm lovin' you
Kissin' you and huggin' you
Even though your friends have got
A different point of view

And after everything 
That we've been through 
It's really easy lovin' you
It's true

My heart has got 
The scars to prove
I'm obsessed with you
And everything you do

Its magical 
It brings me close to you
Close is true
I don't know what you do

And I remember when we started
Everything was so real
And there's no words to express 
The way you make me feel

And lovin' you ain't hard
It's easy 'cause your beautiful
And who knows what's comin' next
Our sex is like a ritual

Ooh child
Baby girl you got a place in my heart
You either hold my life together 
Or you break it apart

You really got a hold on me
Don't you ever let go
Don't you let me be
'Til I tell you so

You're on my mind all the time
You're so controllable
'Cause you oh so fine
And I'm claiming you as mine

Woah-oh hey no
How low will I go
How high can I get
I've lost all control

Woah-oh hey no
How far will we go
You got a hold on my soul
Don't you ever let go

I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

I see a dancer by the jukebox, drinking sangria
Down in Mexico where the carbo cantina
I said ""hey senorita come an dance with me""
If ya haven't got a man that's what I plan to be
Now move a little closer
Put your hands on my body
I'm trapped in the moment, I can hardly breathe
A combination of you plus some melody
Got me feeling like tonight might be meant to be

She looked at me, like I looked at her
Then she licked my lips, I said ""it's on for sure""
Now baby don't stop, I'm feeling you
can't put my finger on one thing
Its everything you do
I say we have a drink or two
Just to set the mood
An head down to the beach on a rendezvous
We can dance on the stars
Swing from the moon
From Cabo San Lucas all the way to Cancun

An begin to unwind

You can take off mine
I'll stand and deliver
Sending shivers up your spine

Ah, shorty rock don't stop
What's it gonna take for you to take me back

Now even though you're gone I still hear your voice my head
And all the sexy things you say when we're laying in bed
Remember you said you'd always be my ride or die girl
Remember my life changed when you came in my world
Bought you so much ice it would give you a brain freeze
I don't want the other girls, you're the one for me
And I can't picture my life without you in it
'cause our love had no bounds and it knew no limits
No gimmicks, it was straight thug passion
I miss afternoon back shots and that late night smashing
Whenever you want it you can have it
I made you my bad habit and gave you more cabbage than a rabbit

Our life together wasn't perfect
We'd argue but when we made up it was all worth it
Why'd you leave me, I just don't get it
Give me one more chance
I promise baby girl you won't regret it

But still I wonder why you're gone
And can you give me one more try
'cause without you I can't go on

That's why I left you with my heart, came back with Christian Dior
But your love didn't cost a thing
Not one red cent
Now I guess I know what J. Lo meant
And I have to admit that you made me a better man
I could love you forever
You were down for whatever and
When you left me it was hard to believe
Feeling like Maroon 5 without ya girl its harder to breath
I thought we'd make it through the coldest weather
We was supposed to grow old together
Man I should've known better
A mistake like that was fatal
That's what I get for being unfaithful 'cause you turned the tables
I know there's plenty stars in the sky and fish in the sea
I know I'm missing you, I hope you feel the same about me
So I apologize and admit I was wrong
Things just haven't been the same since you been gone

And every night I'm seeing visions of you
Its difficult to try to live without you

By making The same mistake day after day

Everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin special like you, 
And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you, 

I see ya everywhere I go, and you're uncomparable, 
To any of these other pretty girls I know, 
And when you walk into the room, girl you steal the show, 
You try to act like you're normal but you're finer than you know, cause, 
Everyone looks when you cross a room, 
One look and I was hooked like be real to boom, 
Cause you play hard to get, which I really respect, 
Lipstick like a red corvette, with intellect, 
Gimme the time, any time, I'm sure we'll connect, 
I'm sure we'll get down, and time will perfect, 
Cause I want you, girl I want you now, 
I'll do everything right the first time around, 
I want to, sex you up and lick you down, 
I said I want you, let me love you now 
I want to, sex you up, let me hold it down, 
I said I want you girl let me love you now. 

[Chorus] 

I can't remember where we met, it's all just a blur, 
But I know what I want, I've never been so sure, 
You're like a treasure, so innocent and pure, 
You become the addiction that my doctor can't cure, 
My friends talk, I don't listen cause they're missing the point, 
They'll never undestand us like I do, I'm after you, 
Cause you're special, you make me think of sexual things, 
Just a boy and a girl, just a king and his queen, 
Only a person that has felt love would know what I mean, 
Cause you got what it takes to make my heart sing, 
Baby make no mistake, you're the girl of my dreams, 
The kinda girl that I could love, that I'd put on my team, 
You could be my candy girl, the sparkle in my eye, 
My inspiration arm in arm, girl I need you by my side, 
I want to sex you up, let me hold it down, 
I said I want you girl, let me love you now, 
And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you. 

And everything I do, I do for you,

Shifty,"Take away the pain
And let me fly away
Take away the pain
And let me fly away

This is a last dance
My last chance
To get it right

At first glance
You might think my life looks nice
But if you look a little closer
I walk on thin ice

I'm one slip from death
Twelve steps from paradise
A young america, riddled from 
Defects of character

A reject, caught in the web
Of mass hysteria
I pray for the world to change
I've seen my friends
Killed in pain

One fix from the end
One drink from insane
I'm stained

I'm lost with my brain broke
Comes second from smoked outs
To livin' the great hopes

So if your gonna save me
Better save me now
I'm an escape artist 
With no escape

I need a way out
My life is way out
The same old played out
Stuck on the same route

So I'm takin' a leap of faith
Hopin' I win this race
Hopin' this time I'm blessed
And don't miss

Cause I know and God knows
I really worked hard for this

[Chorus]

Now when I get away from trouble
I go lookin' for more
Takin' two steps back 
From the bridge to the shore

Tryin' to hustle muscles sore
From doin the devil's chores
Runnin' from my problems
Every gettin' to the door

Been runnin' 'round in circles
Down a dead end roads
I don't know where I'm going
But I act like I know

Borrowin' money 
To pay back what I owe
My head's a three-ring circus
I'm a one man show

Another tatooed freak
I was born in the jar
I was meant to be a sick confused
Loser rock star

So who's the puppet master
I went from county jail
To an open night disaster
Livin' faster gettin' faster

Now mamma's on the front porch
Sippin' on some wine
When daddys in his office
And he's choppin' up some limes
My sister's in the backyard
Smokin' on the green
My brother's in the basement 
Cookin' methamphetamine

[Chorus]

These thoughts collected
I'm tryin' to alter my perspective
I'm commin' to a hault
And to stop is my objective

Time is runnin' out
My luck is runnin' thin
I stuggled too long not to win
Or die tryin'

I see the clock tickin' 
My entire time is flyin'
I'm smilin' at defeats till
Inside I'm cryin'

Lookin' at the sky
Askin' why I can't live
A simple life its a lie
To say the grass ain't
Greener on the other side

A poor excuse for heaven sent
Cause I can't climb the fence
No matter how hard I try
I'm wrapped in barbbed-wire
Wonderin' who's on my side

Rusty knives in my back there's
No where left for me to hide
I'm wrapped up in sin
So I'm in for a ride

I'd commit suicide 
But I don't want to die
I'm sick of gettin' high 
And I'm sick of these games

There's not enough drugs to take
To take away the pain

Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away",Take Away the Pain,2004

These other girls, have been there too, 
Nothin' that I wouldn't do, for you, for you, 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on 

[Verse 1:] 

Now I've never had the feelin' that I get from you, 
It's hard to believe but I know it's true, 
You leave me breathless, you're precious, you're beautiful in every way, 
At first I second guessed it but our love won't fade, 
Every day I grow closer, with every word you say, 
Me and you have got something that no one's taking away, 
There were times that I thought I was in love before, 
I've been let down, I'm less now, shifty's got an angel and it's all for you, 
It's all for you, I ain't worried cause you know exactly what to do, 
And when everything's wrong you make it all ok, 
I come home stressed and you take it away, 
It's the little things you do, that mean so much, 
I need your love, your kiss, your touch, 
And it never gets old, I still feel the rush, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2:] 

Now there's me and you, and everyone else, 
I remember when I used to only think about myself, 
But you changed that fast, love is changing me, 
I used to be a playa then we came to be, 
True chemistry, I believe you're my destiny, 
Cause I'm free when you're next to me, 
You're a lady in the living room, a freak in the bedroom, 
Oh so for real when I'm bumpin' to neck tunes, 
You can nibble on my neck, don't stop too soon, 
Let me know before you cum so I can cum with you, 
This is sexual healin', and I'm a sex fiend, 
So let's stay together like my name was Al Green, 
Yea, I got you, like I told you so, 
I'ma hold you in my arms and never let go, 
And at first I smiled, and then you blushed, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3:] 

The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on, 
The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on.

We broke all the rules
Just to do it
And I don't know how the hell
I lived through it
Young and on the run
Gettin' loaded like a gun
When we were young

Time sure flies
When your havin' fun
I wish I walked through life
But I chose to run

I used to beat for abuse
And play with guns
I played to pay the price
Till my life ain't done

I remember runnin' wild
Not a care in the world
It was all about graffiti
And chasin' the girls

Runnin' from the law
And bar room brawls
Gettin' arrested callin' home
With those late night calls
(when we were young)

Sorry mom I'm in jail again
Tonight I got arrested
With a couple of friends
You can either pick me up

Or you can send me some mint
Either way mom it looks like 
I messed up again

Back to my p.o. or rehab
Or up north to see dad
Its just the way it goes
You were born to be bad

Flickin' off the principal

Pockets full of sex toys

Up my sleeve

So went up to thirty-two
Takin' part in dirty deeds
So if you want to get high 
I got whatever you need

And if you want to get 'em up
I ain't afraid to bleed
I've been to y.a. three times
So don't you step to me

And while you bragged to your parents
'bout your A's and be	's 
I was underneath the bleechers
With a t.h.c, a g.e.d, a chemical dependancy
And a p.h.d in whiskey and stoner-ology

Met the break-through
In ways to use technology
And you can learn from my mistakes
But its more fun to follow me

And its never too late
I don't hate who I've become
So that smokin' at the one

Dough piling, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Balling, cop some Charles Jordan and some icebergs
Ice herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me, you under lock and key?

Nothing innocent here, this henneson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party yea is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snugly fitted, ruggedly hitting

Shihad,"Wrapped up. Spat out in your self doubt
Should I rip my heart out
Pack it up and send it to you
Things said in anger
Said for gain
Said to cut down
I'll never hear again
Well a part of me sees it all too clear
But another part still burns
For the safety, for the comfort
But our hate outgrew our love and ate it

I can see it started years ago
And I recognise your pain
But I can't forget the innocence
That you've taken from me
Now I see you
But I can't hear you

No, I can't hate you
No, and I don't want to break you down
There's just some things that I want to tell you
Now that you're not hear to drown me out
I've just got to break through

I collect the poison as it spills from your mouth
Savour the taste so that I may work you out
When affection becomes affliction
Let it go

Been watching for far too long
Far too long to get this wrong
I've got the scars to prove it

'Cause you're so bitter inside",Bitter,1995
Shihad,"So nice of you to say
Plans laid out for the highway
Delivering us to the truth
But that road ain't heading my way
And every suggestion that 
Finds it's way through the lines
Is it mine? Is it anybody elses?
I leave it behind

Looks like we're falling over again
Looks like we're falling over
I feel it pull me under
Looks like we're falling over
The call goes out and everybody 
Moves, here we go

I of sound mind
Fetch me a fix of an aesthetic
Up front, behind
It keeps me hanging on

To take time, to break time
Hate, it's the function
And it keeps me pushing through",The Call,1995
Shihad,"Don't tell me where you've been
Cause I know just where you've been

Cause that shit just ain't worth selling

And it goes,
Pain, pain, wash away
It hurts so much to watch you play
Dream, dream, stay with me
Tell me another story

Don't think I'm taken in
I don't think it's turning out the way you planned it
I'm not yours to plan with

And I pray for the rain,
To wash you far away",Debs Night Out,1995
Shihad,"Falling, was it right?
Could you tell me, is it right?
To envy
Your final escape

Well I spent all year packing on the make-up
Spent all year waiting for your call
And when it didn't come
I was nailed, I was nailed
And when it didn't come
It left me standing
Feet nailed to the floor

So out of sight
How could you think you were below envy
Was it right?",Envy,1995
Shihad,"What are you still doing here?
Your stability offers no comfort to me. It don't fill me up
Process what's going through my head
What I've done and what I've said. It won't help me out
Ever thought that by expanding your own mind
Instead of putting me through your own design
You might start learning
Why so many of us feel we don't belong,
So unreal in what you built here,
'cause what you built here
'cause what you built here

Don't fill me up
Don't help me out
I can't feel my feet on the ground

Feel the edge of a new sensation
Life with you it's so complicated
Won't you let me find my own way
'cause what we've got happening here
Ain't nothing bad, ain't nothing you should fear
It's a celebration
'cause I learn from what you learn
But I burn for what you burn
And I think it's time we let the past lie 'cause the future is what I earn't
Pass this world on before the sun goes down
There's untapped beauty to be found
This time is my time

And that fills me up
And now I found
I can feel my feet on the ground

Strong weaken as time deserts the past

Come on, get off the beaten path",For What You Burn,1995
Shihad,"See that sky through the window, that sky for me
But I got to learn to breathe water before I get that high
And all that is pure, through all that is meaningless
Strike the balance
Strip back to the core
And it's too late now, I'm much too far gone
To get a hold of my security and the cloud that I flew from
And I'm ready to start now, this is what I waited for
And the vision it brings such a beautiful thing
That I'm brought to my knees as I finally learn to breathe

See that face in the mirror
Past bone and skin and into the heart of me
I celebrate this bleeding
If that's what scares you
If that's what's pulling you down
Then its time you stop deceiving
'Cause it's too late now
I just can't go on
Holding out on myself what and what I could become
And I'm ready to start now
I will 'cause I can

Get up
I will stand",Get Up,1995

I'd learn to run but it's not that simple
Friendly service, with a smile
But there's still no one to hand me a line
Said flowers for you people
It's like ashes to the blind

All you faces in a race
You've got your number, you've got your place
Keep pushing through thick and thin
Collect what you can before winter sets in
You can keep your ashes
What's keeping you blind?
Nothing at all

All you sees not what you wanted
All you sees not what you wanted at all
And we're heading for a time
Where what we've got are the things we find
And we're heading for a time
Believe that we're getting robbed

I'd learn to run
I'd learn to run but it's not that simple
I learned to run
State of things is so sad, sad, sad, sad, sad

We've got the latest in in fashion
We sway the peoples voice
Have you got the right kitchenware?
Have you made the right choice?
We make sure we sell it like you need it
If you don't get it we just repeat it
One more useless product
Until the next one comes
You bought one of those
Won't you try one of these

I met a lamp and a man with a silvercup
Lamb has a grievance, wants to take it up with him
Lamb lies face down, Trampled in the pavement
There's still no reason to criticize
It's all here in black and white
Lay down the law so he can victimize the pack
You won't drag me down

All aboard the future, as he held in his hands
Pennies for the chosen but what about the lamb?

I hope it squeezes your heart so fuckin' tight

I hope I never touch you again
Sometimes I wonder, what's fucked in my heart
Won't let your fingers tear us apart

It's all so simple, it's all over again
A lack of talent is caving you in
Sometimes I wonder what's fucked in your heart
We're losing grip now, now we're falling apart

The speaker speaks but the words sound haunted

Attack
And enclose me in your arms

All of us on the same road home
And if one should fall or falter
Then we all reach down together as one
And we lift them up again

Only our world
Could we find some meaning
So we created our own
Still here today
I had a dream, I was lost at sea
All of you
Afloat on the same boat home
Please throw me a line
I think I'm drowning
So you all lent over
to pick me up

As you headed on out the door
Just to trip you up and spit you out
Well I can tell just what your thinking
I'll be there to catch you, falling out your tree tonight

Relax your mind, let it slowly float away tonight
Forget about the day

The world sits on your shoulders
Looks like an ugly weight to bear
Almost lost you underneath there

I can't slow down, my minds moving too fast
And I don't like the things I'm thinking
I said brother, try to relax
It takes time for things to pass
He said fine and then he threw me out the door

Should of stayed
He was on the floor
So much pain
Could I have done more?
Saw a ghost from the past just the other day
His body still works but his soul flew away
Or sits somewhere inside behind locked doors
I said brother you should relax
You were better in times that past

Release your hate boys

Time to pay your dues to your misplaced frustrations

Sitting there chewing his fat
He made it clear I wasn't his mate
Didn't concern me at all

I can't believe the bother your giving me

And if you got something to do, then you shit out of luck

Und die Menge schreit (yes)
Ein schritt nach vorn ,ein weiterer Sampler
Greif ins Lenkrad Geisterfahrt
Es ist Zeit, dass sich die Scheiße ändert
Aufbrausend im Benz gestylt,die Türen gehen auf
Schon brennt die Scheiße
Wir rollen an,schon hängt die Kleine
Hechelnd an der Fensterscheibe
Bring sie her, kostenlos mach ich sie zu Charlotte Roche,
Zum Pavian, die Vagina
Verfärbt sich 2/3 Wochen Rot
Setz mich ein für Menschenfeinde
Vorbildlich und fresh gestylt
Zeig ich mich von der besten Seite
Heb den Krug und ex' die Scheiße
Und wer gerne mitmachen will
Muss sich, wir haben nur ein bisschen drauf stehen
Auszurasten, auszupacken, das und ein gewisses Aussehen
Wenn es klappt hielten sie Händchen
Und schon geht es verdächtig schnell ein Pflock in ihrem Kopf
Zu schieben wie beim Legomännchen
Sie hat mehr fremde Spinner,beherbergt als mein Gästezimmer
Ein paar Bier, 2 Döner nur mit Fleisch: ein perfektes Dinner
Und als Gastgeschenk stürmen vier Leute
Als Straßengang,bewaffnet in dein Haus und feiern Abrissparty

Ey der Boss, eingebildet wie 'ne Fata Morgana
Chill ich am Block, ticke an deine Freunde Marihuana
Bin dein Idol. Doch deine Mum findet das katastrophal, da
Ich mal eine Frau geschlagen hab wie dieser Barack Obama
Dabei, wie durchtrainierte Marathonstarter, 'ne gute Zeit gehabt hab
Bitch, ich komm in Armani und Prada, Player, wie Mario Basler,
Steig in das Cabrio, fahr dann zur Party
Nehm Bitches auf den Arm wie mein Platinumarmband
Sag zu Ihnen: Ey, ich mach zehn Riesen Netto jeden Monat
Also los geht auf die Knie und dann lächelt wie ein Donut!
Sie kichern nur, also drück ich Ihren Kopf nach unten
Und werd dann von den Schlampen angezeigt wie Boxkampfrunden
Doch scheiß auf Staatsanwälte, ey, ich hab Star-Anwälte
Die mich wieder raushauen, wie Golfer aus dem Graben Bälle
Trage Marderpelze, du Fubu-Shirts.
Es ist der Boss mit von-oben-herab-Weltanschauung wie Google Earth

Platz 1 in den Myspace Top-Friends deiner Mum
Ey, yo, guck mal den:
Deine Mutter bläst, es kullern Tränen
Ich dreh jetzt Pornos, bald kannst du in Full HD mein Puller sehen
Du willst Trouble du Pussy? Ich rauch Babylon Schuss
Ich genieß das selbe Idiotenimage wie W. Bush
Ich will mich killen, mein Leben macht kein Spaß mehr ohne Pillen zu nehmen
Ich will mich weiterbilden und guck nach, was in der Bild so steht
Keine Furcht vor dem Teufel, noch hab ich Furcht vor euch
Seid ruhig, ihr Toys, man ich bin dümmer als der Durchschnittsdeutsche
Ich bin Ghetto, ich ficke die Welt, wie du triffst Fav am Block
Ich zieh dich ab wie mich mein geldgieriger Labelboss (Slick One)
Junge, Fav ist der man, jetzt ist Selfmade im Trend
Du signst in den Staaten? Lass mich raten! Making the Band!
Du willst mein Bodyguard sein? Du wirst zu Boden gerammt
Von einer Millionen von Schlampen zu Tode getrampelt!

But dont nobody wanna suffer
Nobody wantsta die cuz they all bustas
And suckaz

Cuz they be frontin
Gotta sacrifice
Three time for every dime they be wantin
And believe me
Being a thug it aint that easy
I once was a fool but see they had to free me
I'm undercover man
But still they aint respectin me
Tryin to get the best of me constantly stressin me

Atempted homicide

This cold world had me num the pain like novacaine
Till mama sat me down unfold the gate
Showed me the straight path through the narrow lane
Sunshine after rain the joy of pain
Mama you raised a good girl don't worry
You used to say take it slow trina don't hurry
Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story
Now I grown up and you still there for me
My shoulder to lean on 
You kept my dreams goin
I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing
And I'm gon always be yo baby
And I  can't never repay you for all the things that you gave me
You raised me to be a lady
And you scoot me to the game so them niggas couldnt play me
You was more than a mother you was a friend 
The greatest love of all comes from within 
I know ill never kknow love like this again
And beneath my wings you was the wind
I love you like none other
Cause you can only live your whole life but only get one mother
 
Being there for me through the thick and thin
More than a mother your my best friend 
Look within and take yo place

Sometimes I want to run to ya
Through the ups and downs I know I can still come to ya
I think bout the things I done to ya 
But through all the drama I know I'm still number one to ya
Uh, look at how far you brought me 
All the things you have taught me 
Money couldnt bought me
You never wanted us to make the same mistakes
When the game got high and they raised the stakes
You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe
Through the thick and thin I'm gon be there for ya
I say a prayer for ya 
Lord knows I care for ya 
Through hard times we got strong  or mother to daughter 
When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water
Can't nobody replace you 
I'm forever faithful
For you mama I'm grateful

I thank the lord up above cause he blessed me with you, uh

Shindy,"In deinem kleinen Haus brennt nie wieder Licht,
Worte könn' nicht ausdrücken wie ich dich vermiss'.
Ich war so ein Bengel,
Oma war ein Engel.
Nur das Allerbeste gut genug für ihren Enkel.
Kannst du dich erinnern an den Tag, als ich mir Ohrlöcher stechen ließ,
Du hast geweint vor Enttäuschung, das vergess' ich nie.
Hab mich so sehr dafür geschämt, dass ich den Blick senkte.
Kein Tag mehr vergeht, an dem ich nicht an dich denke,
Eine starke Frau, stolz und immer gerade aus.
Wolltest, dass man mich auf den Namen deines Vaters tauft.
Oma brachte mir bedingunglose Liebe bei,
Oma stand um drei nachts auf und machte Spiegelei,
Denn für dich gab es nie was wichtigeres.
Und ich hab immer gebetet, dass du mich nie verlässt.
Hab mich weinend in mein Zimmer eingesperrt als du gings',
Und ich wünscht' ich könnt noch einmal hören wie sehr du mich liebst.

There are no words that can express how I feel

Ich danke dir für jeden Rat, danke dir für die Musik.
Ich hoffe meine Worte kommen an im Paradies'.
Hör' so oft noch deine Stimme, wie du sagst ich solle aufpassen,
Wie du sagst du liebst mich mehr, als deinen Augapfel,
Oma schuftete sich früher auf den Tabakfeldern ab,
Und hat die wunderbarste Frau für mich zur Welt gebracht.
Oma's Weisheiten sind mehr wert, als alle Schätze dieser Erde,
'Ne ganze Bücherei kann nicht ersetzen, was ich lernte.
Leider wirst du meine Hochzeit nicht erleben,
Meine Kinder nicht erleben,
Kanns' noch immer nicht verstehn',
Aber ich glaub' der Himmel brauchte seinen Engel wieder.
Und sollt' ich je 'ne Tochter haben nenn' ich sie Sophia.
Und manchmal muss ich weinen, wenn ich an dich denk'
Und manchmal muss ich lachen, wenn ich an dich denk'
Und manchmal wenn ich abends draußen sitz' und rauch'
Fehlt das Licht aus deinem Haus, denn es ist aus.

One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply, so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
Keep these feelings, no one knows
What ever happened to the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

What ever happened to the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Everyone's pointing their fingers
Always condemning me
And nobody knows what I believe

That I come alive, just before I have to hide.

Because I believe I'm losing my nerve

Because all I ever wanted was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm gone
All I ever wanted was a place to call my own
Where stars may dance and sun still shines and the storms feel free to roam

I listen if only for a while
But I can't decide if I'm aware that I'm on trial

If there's a path or a door I missed , then show me now, show me this

How about a better version that makes me understand?
How about a better version of the way that I am?

Excuse the wall, I put it up from time to time
A silver shade, and the design is all mine
It's just a maze that everyday I seem to be stuck in
It never seems to fade away but I pray for the day it ends

Some questions are better left without a reason
And I would rather reveal myself than my situation
Now and then I consider my hesitation

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning, burning bright

I wonder if the things I did were just to be different
To spare myself of the constant shame of my existence
And I would surely redeem myself in my desperation
Here and now I'll express my situation

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning bright
The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning

There's nothing ever wrong, but nothing's ever right
Such a cruel contradiction
I know I crossed the line, it's not easy to define
I'm born to indecision
There's always something new, some path I'm supposed to choose
With no particular rhyme or reason

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me

The more the dark consumes me

Because I can't wait for you to catch up with me
And I can't live in the past and drown myself in memories

And tell me the one about the hand that holds you down
Because you seem to be lost, with no intention to be found

Shinedown,"I feel like there is no need for conversation
Some questions are better left without a reason
And I would rather reveal myself than my situation
Now and then I consider my hesitation

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning, burning bright

I wonder if the things I did were just to be different
To spare myself of the constant shame of my existence
And I would surely redeem myself in my desperation
Here and now, I'll express my situation

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning bright

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning

There's nothing ever wrong but nothing's ever right
Such a cruel contradiction, I know I crossed the line
It's not easy to define, I'm born to indecision
There's always something new some path I'm supposed
To choose with no particular rhyme or reason

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning bright

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning

In the starlight you look so bright you eclipsed the moon
On a highway just today that's where I saw you
There was music from a distance burning through

She's here to rescue me
Clear my mind and set me free
If it's dark she still shines a master piece made by design
She's here to rescue me 
Stain my mind with make believe
When its dark she still shines she's my lady so devine

When the waves break
And souls take refuge from the night 
On a mountain
There's a story told a thousand times 
Of a garden and a bed there made to rest our eyes 
There's a comfort to a softness that will not be denied

'cause you need that desire in your heart to survive
And you need that burning fire in your soul to know

Are so fiercesomely bright, my love
I have no fear
I am Atticus now

Like Pandora adored the euphoria as her heart raced
Like love lost you've got to try even in vain
Feels like you'll go insane
But you're the hardest instrument that I've ever had to play

I get a feeling
Like I've left something behind me
But I don't know what it is yet

Like I tied a piece of string
Round my finger
And I hope this will remind me
Of the places I have been through

When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

Every now and then
When I'm feeling lonely
I turn on my radio
Because I'm hoping that you're out there

It seems so long ago 
I would see your writing
On a postcard or a note
And your stories would excite me

When I was down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

Wherever you stop along the way
I hope the wind blows you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And if I'm only dreaming
Then won't you tear the curtains down
And let the light back into this empty room?

Kissing in your room
Climbing out the window
Trying not to make a sound, but
With my first love on my mind

You see, we were never through
I never said I loved you
Even when we said goodbye
Never thought it was the last time

Down, down, down
And I'm down, down, down

Wherever you stop along the way
I hope the wind'll blow you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And still, every now and then I hear a voice
Singing to me softly
Deep inside my head
And it sings till I fall asleep
If I'm only dreaming
Won't someone tear the curtains down?

To deepen in your mysteries

At the tides of these seas

Left a thumpin' in my head

And I don't wear the same robes in May

退屈そうな授業風景
窓際の席に君と僕
セピアと呼ばれるようになる
図書室で君を見つけたよ
スローモーションで動いてる
古い映画のように絶賛上映中
巨大な想いを映してる
そうだ僕は君を見たいのです
あーあとで君を忘れたいのに

3、2、1で
アルバム開いて記憶を繋いで
8ミリフィルムの世界の中へ
後ろ振り向くと君の席
シェイクスピアも
ロミオとジェラシーだ
用紙を後ろにまわす時
話しかけようか迷います
オードリーヘップバーンまで
いかないけれど
君こそ素敵なヒロインだ
そうだ僕は君を見たいのです
あーあとで君を忘れたいのに
照明機材は照らしだす
放送室からも流れ出す
だんだん色をつけ始める
背景が、青い空が現れてきたなら
景色をひとつ君にあげよう
そして季節をひとつそこにつけよう
そして奇跡をひとつ君に見せよう
3、2、1で始めます
準備はいいかい3、2、1

20世紀へと僕は君に届けます
あーあとで君を忘れたいのに
だとしても君の席に
後ろの席に 僕がつくった
巨大な景色を差し上げます",Eiga,2012

叶わない恋がある

美しくなれたらいいな
そうおもう時

効きすぎてるだけだから
普通かな、大丈夫かなと
気にしちゃうんだ
精神薬をもっときかせて
こんな自分が
まあどーでもいいんですけどねっ

美花ちゃんの手を食いちぎる時、
美花ちゃんの顔があばば

効きすぎてるだけだから
傷つけてくるような人は
ぶち殺したい

まあどーでもいいんですけどねっ

刃物ふりかざして
イカれたふりしてみよう
と思います
野菜ジュース飲んで
がんばっちゃっていた
自分もいた
みんな殺してやる

剥ぎ合わせた可愛さ着ても
凄く辛い

I try, to digest my pride
But passion's grip I fear
When I climb, into shallow vats of wine
I think I almost hear, but it's not clear

On my skin your fingers
Runaway until the last time
We're gonna lose forever

When you try, don't try to say you won't
Try to crawl into my head
When you cry, 'cause it's all built up inside
Your tears already said, already said

West end girl trying to see yourself
Running in a number one
Shoot 'em up

Race to edge of the world
To the edge of the world
Knocking down
Waking up

you're a breaking girl
Hearts stop and seize
Making love in the weather
Making moves together

Staying close forever
Riding in our cars
From the Moon to Mars
Everyday, every night

Becomes a thousand hours
Come and follow you
Follow down to excess
Return to righteousness

Dancing late at night
Hunting high and low
With your pretty pink bow
Weather girl, where did you go?

Girlfriend, I really need you
Don't go, don't go
Girlfriend, I really miss you
Don't go, don't go

Never making hesitation
Making everyone hold their breath
Criss-cross over miles of eyes
Ending looks shooting over

The heads are turning
Your shadow of death
You're ready for this

Weather girl, where's your forecast?
Set the signal
Raining fire from the angels
Through the eye of a needle

Making moves, making stars
Falling faster than the start
Of the end of the world
You're the breaking girl

The first broadcast from you

you'll never go too far
There's no stopping the show

We're not in trouble anymore, anyway
And no more synthetic fighting
They stopped the right thing after today.

When they took the beach that day
They stole the children, took them away
And I miss everyone, but most of all the little ones
And the shiny toy guns.

Each and everyone of us still pray
Hoping for evidence
Looking for clues
All the robotic families, searching the circuitry
For what remains.

When they took the beach that day
They stole the children, took them away
And I miss everyone, but most of all the little ones
And the shiny toy guns.

I remember mother that day
When her tears woke us so quietly
From our dreams
She told us, that father's sleeping
And he is watching from far away.

I believe you wanna save my searching soul
Thought I met you in conversation
But I'm alone with your voice inside my head

It was September when the cold ran down my face
I want the fire back bending me back in shape
I hit the floor when the thoughts are too much pain
And you said I'll save your broken heart

Next time I'll wait for the sun (oh)
Next time I'll wait for the sun (oh)
Next time I'll wait for (I'll wait) I'll wait for the sun

I know your dreams are full of dragons
Speaking words in foreign language
And now you're stuck like oil to canvas
And you're alone with my voice inside your head

It was December when the cold ran down your face
Far along, far away from goodness grace
You hit the floor when the thoughts are too much pain
And I swear I'll save your broken heart

Next time I'll wait for the sun (oh)

And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
(love can never be exactly like we want it to be)
I could be satisfied knowing you love me

And will you still love me tomorrow

You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Shirley Bassey,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

Shirley Bassey,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away 

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,

Though by tomorrow you're gone;

The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

Where is she, where is the woman for me?

For every prince there's a princess
For every Joe there's a Joan
And if you wait, you will find the mate
Born for you alone, happy to be your own
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

Find the one, find the one
Then together you will find the sun

For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love

Yet you want to be free.
Your world is full of dreams,
Of what you hoped would be.

You would never be lost
And where love was concerned,
Your rivers would be crossed
And bridges could be burned.

It was great to be free

And you would hold the key,

And suddenly you find
That the world is not a dream
And this you have to learn

Is something you must earn.

Is your heart still as sure,
As it was in your dream?
Are you thoughts still as pure
And not what they may seem?

Were you always the same,
Taking others for fools?
Are you playing a game
And making up the rules?

Do you cherish your love,
Or regret with a sigh?
Will you laugh at the world
As each day passes by?

Now you want to be loved,
Yet you want to be free,
But love is not a game 
This can never be.

You're sincere you believe,
To yourself you are true,
But what can you achieve
When miracles are few?

Comes a time you awake
To the way you must live,
For those who love to take,
Sometimes have got to give.

If you want to be loved,
You can never be free,

Drinking up the night, trying not to drown

Trying to be brave, running from the truth
Autumn turns the leaves to gold, slowly dies the heart
Sad, young men are growing old, that's the cruelest part

All the sad, young men, seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for just a little while
Tired, little girl, does the best she can
Trying to be gay for a sad, young men

I'm still around
I'm still around 
And still remembering
If there's a chance
One little chance 
That you are lonely too
Well, here I am
Yes, here I am 
Still wanting you
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
I'd walk the floor each night
I'd cry myself to sleep
I'd call myself a fool
I'd suffer all the pain
That loving you can bring 
And then and then
I'd do it all again
I'd swallow all my pride
I'd run each time you call
I'd crawl for just one kiss
I'd tear myself apart
But still I'd give my heart
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again",I'd Do It All Again,1972

Then tomorrow will dawn
And the days of our years
Will rise on that morn

If we only have love
To embrace without fears
We will kiss with our eyes
We will sleep without tears

If we only have love
With our arms open wide
Then the young and the old
Will stand at our side

If we only have love
Love that's falling like rain
Then the parched desert earth
Will grow green again

If we only have love
For the hymn that we shout
For the song that we sing
Then we'll have a way out

If we only have love
We can reach those in pain
We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names

If we only have love
We can melt all the guns
And then give the new world
To our daughters and sons

If we only have love
Then Jerusalem stands
And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands

If we only have love
We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither heroes nor clowns

If we only have love
Then we'll only be men
And we'll drink from the Grail
To be born once again

But the little we are
We'll have conquered all time

Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves

We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit

But neither one cared
We were gettin' our share
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime

And oh the wonder
We felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962

Of my life
Crying over my mistakes, forgetting all the breaks I've had 
In my life
I was put on earth to be, a part of this great world is me 
And my life
Guess I'll just add up the score, and count the things I'm grateful for

Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me

And I took him for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
He's out of my hands

And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression

Been high in the Rockies 
Under the evergreens

And I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind 
It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
And now I need a little give and take

And that's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide

Well, I say, will you catch me crying? Not this kid
Will I soon forget you? I just did
Does it really hurt me? Only when I laugh

Is my heart finally numb yet?
Yeah, I don't think I feel one thing
After too long of running cold and hot
And cold, you end up blue

So, I'll just change things on my mailbox, suits me fine
And since you've gone on your way, I'll go mine
Does it really hurt me? Only when I laugh

Every time I fell in love
I never fell completely
The joke is, I was saving something
For the person that I thought was you

Well, I guess I was dreaming
Glad the fantasy's dead and gone
And if my mind keeps running back and forth
And back and forth don't take that as a clue
