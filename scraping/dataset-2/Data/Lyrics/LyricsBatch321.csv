Gordon Beck,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
for your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.
Feelin' sad,
really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight,1986
Gordon Beck,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1986
Gordon Beck,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1986
Gordon Beck,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
",Solitude,1986
Gordon Beck,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing

Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

Gordon Beck,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

To be where you are?
How far is the journey

Gordon Bradberry,"I used to kiss Maxine through the front door screen
Standin' on her mama's steps
And if her daddy hadn't come along and run me off
I know I'd have never left
It's a cryin' shame but that's they way it was
Something always there to separate us

Well I tried not to let it show
But everyone seemed to know
There's something between
Me and Maxine

She used to wave at me from across the street
Through her bedroom window every night
She was almost close enough for me to touch
But I still couldn't hold her tight

Always something there to keep us apart

Gordon Chambers,"Baby love, you've cried a river of tears
Abandoned by a lover who was just not sincere
But I promise you, I'll never leave you alone
If you sail away with me, baby, I will lead you to shore

If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright
If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright

Don't be disillusioned, maybe you need a friend
Somebody who will stand by you from beginning to end
But when you walk my way, I see the pair in your eyes
Sail away with me, baby all the way to sunrise

If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright
If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright

You're a lady and you need a man
Who will love you the way that I can
When you're hurting someone loving and strong
Who'll respect you and protect
Would you let me be the one

If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright
If you stay by my side
Everything will be alright

",By My Side,2007
Gordon Chambers,"When will this ever end
I thought that you forgave me then
So why do we argue so, I want to know
Now we both made some mistakes
That caused our two hearts to break
But we must learn to forgive and love again

There are some things I wish that I could change
But if we're going to move forward let's bygones be bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it, let bygones be bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it, let bygones be bygones

Now I will be the first to say
That I'm sorry for treating you that way
But that was so long ago, we need to let it go

There are some things I wish that I could change, oh yes I do
But if we're going to move forward let bygones be bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it let bygones be bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it let bygones be bygones

Instead of living for today
We let the past get in the way

Bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it let bygones be bygones
Bygones, so long
I don't want to talk about it let bygones be bygones

",Bygones,2007
Gordon Chambers,"Summertime is almost here
Getting the pool clean, we've been waiting all year
For some backyard fun, to light the grill
To pour the chardonnay that's already chilled
When you're singing and laughing you're never alone
But the truth is that I wish this house were a home 'cause

I got the right stereo and the places to go
I got the getaway car and the champagne in the bar
I've got the girl by my side, always ready to ride
All a man could dream of but I wish, wish I was in love

Party's over, we had big fun
Barbecue chicken wings and Jamaican rum
We played bidwiss and talked all night long
And they said, ""Gordon, would you give us a song and you that I did""
See I get stressed but I'm too blessed to ever complain
But I'm human, need a good woman, through the joy and the pain

I got the right stereo and the places to go
I got the getaway car and the champagne in the bar
I've got the girl by my side, always ready to ride
All a man could dream of but I wish, wish I was in love

With somebody who truly cares, who I know will always be there
The good wife, the partner, who can I handle the drama
And when the party's over, the one I take home to mama, yeah, yeah

",I Wish I Was in Love,2007
Gordon Chambers,"Would I be standing here
After all these years
Among the stars above?
Maybe not if it wasn't for your love

Smiling faces are all around
Like when a king has just been crowned
And the battle has been won
That I'd have lost if it wasn't for your love

A fairytale unfolds
More true than stories I've been told

At last my chance to shine
And all in perfect time
I live the life I once dreamed of
Who'd have thought
If it wasn't for your love
Yes, it was

Oh what a wonderful surprise
To see a light so bright it blinds
It blinds my eyes

But finally I see
Just how it feels to live a dream
But would I have touched the sky?
Ever flown so high
No, not I, if it wasn't for your love
No, no, if it wasn't for your love

",If It Wasn't for Your Love,2007
Gordon Chambers,"Drama, I've had my share 'til I had to shut it down
Act like I didn't care
But I'm human, I've got a big heart
Wanna finish the next relationship that I start

The next time I fall in love
Gonna make sure that she is really the one
The next time I fall in love
I'm gonna take my time 'til the battle is one
Next time I fall

My heartaches I couldn't hide
I smile for the cameras and held on to my pride
But the next holiday, come cake cutting time
I'm gonna be there with my own valentine

The next time I fall in love
Gonna make sure that she is really the one
The next time I fall in love
I'm gonna take my time 'til the battle is one
Next time I fall

It's gonna be better than it was before, no more
No more yelling and screaming and walking out the door
I wanna know, wanna know what makes you happy
Anything you wanna ask me, I'll tell it all

The next time I fall in love
Gonna make sure that she is really the one
The next time I fall in love
I'm gonna take my time 'til the battle is one
Next time I fall

Gordon Chambers,"Sit back unwind, lay down, recline
Let me pour you a glass of wine
Tell me how was your day?
Did things go your way?
Tell me whatever's on your mind

You can cry, you can smile, be silent for a while
Baby just be yourself, it's only me and no one else
You say you're just stopping by
You're in a rush by, oh why?
Girl, the night's just begun
We can have a little fun if you

Stay, stay baby, just a little bit longer
I'll be the DJ if you let the music play, play baby
The party's not over

Ain't trying to cause harm, I just want to charm you
Everything about you turns me down
The touch of your hand makes me understand
That your beauty was part of God's plan

Stay, stay baby, just a little bit longer
I'll be the DJ if you let the music play, play baby
The party's not over

You make me feel alive, finally I realize
I could share all my dreams with you
Tell me what do you want to do?
I'll make your fantasies come true if you

Not one ribbon for her hair.

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Gordon Jenkins,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day, father started digging in a field, hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and, what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out
With a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now, who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em gel
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostest on the ball

They would go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostest on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you, all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostest on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea
What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

There's a book of regulations 
As to who sits next to who
But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastest protocol
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

An ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down, ooh!
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
Of the priestess with the leastest
Nor the hostess with the mostest
With the mostest on the ball",The Hostess with the Mostes' on the Ball,1950

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder, I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Or I'll never fall in love

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too

Gordon Jenkins,"When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone so what can matter
No sweet lover a man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violins are playing weird and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style

Gordon Jenkins,"I went to London town
To clear up my mind
Then on to Paris
For the fun I couldn't find
I found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you?

Tried seeing Singapore
But that wouldn't do
Went to Vienna
But I found you there, too
Even in Switzerland, your memory came through
Where can I go without you?

I wanted travel, I wanted romance
I chased that rainbow across the sea
I'm tired of faces, and quaint old places
If you can't be there with me

Back on the boat again
And farewell to France
Farewell to London town
They haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen
For just one loving glance
Where can I go without you?

Better face the facts, ol' buddy,
And be prepared to take the blow.
You don't have to sit and study,
It's something anyone should know.
Shake hands... get your hat...
And go.


You can praise her eyes,
And adore her hair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.


And you can walk her home
In the warm spring air,
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.


And you can look
With a longing in your look,
And try every method in the book
And worship the smile that kind of
Took you unaware.


And you can weep and sigh,
You can say, ""unfair"".
You can almost die of despair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.

But these things your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he won't call, but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

Gordon Jenkins,"I think that I shall never see
A poem as lovely as a tree
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast

O, a tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray
A tree that may in summer wear
Yeah, a nest of robins in her hair

Upon whose bosom snow has lain
Who intimately lives with rain [Incomprehensible]
Poems are made by fools like me
But only God can make a tree

A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

And not much heart to fight

Gordon Jenkins,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1996

When baby, you don't love me anymore

Say it isn't so
Tell me you're not leaving
Say you changed your mind now
That I am only dreaming
That this is not goodbye
This is starting over

I don't wanna let go
So say it isn't so

Ten to five at least we tried
We're still alive but hope just died

Shake the ground beneath the wheels

Oh! Will you never set me free?

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2007

Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall

Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers

Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration

Is in the stardust of a song

And from that day never more will I say

In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
From 1 o'clock til 4
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moaning all the morning
And mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around... around
I'm waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away

You don't and I'm left alone.

Irene, goodnight,
Irene, goodnight,
Goodnight, Irene,
Goodnight, Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.
Last Saturday night I got married,
Me and my wife settle down,,
Now me and my wife are parted,
I'm gonna take another stroll in town.

Sometimes I live in the country,
Sometimes I live in town,
Sometimes I have a great notion,
To jump in the river and drown.

Against the earth's sweet flowing breast

Who intimately lives with rain [Incomprehensible]

Gordon Lightfoot,"I'm standin' at the doorway
My head bowed in my hands
Not knowin' where to sit
Not knowin' where I stand

My father looms above me
For him there is no rest
My mothers arms enfold me
And hold me to her breast

They say you been out wanderin'
They say you travelled far
Sit down young stranger
And tell us who you are

The room has all gone misty
My thoughts are all in spin
Sit down young stranger
And tell us where you been

Well, I've been up to the mountain
I've walked down by the sea
I never questioned no one
And no one questioned me

My love was given freely
And oftimes was returned
I never came to borrow
I only came to learn

Sometimes it did get lonely
But it taught me how to cry
And laughter came too easy
For life to pass me by

I never had a dollar
That I didn't earn with pride
'Cause I had a million daydreams
To keep me satisfied

And will you gather daydreams
Or will you gather wealth
How can you find your fortune
When you cannot find yourself?

My mothers eyes grow misty
There's a tremblin' in her hand
Sit down young stranger
I do not understand

And will you try and tell us
You've been too long at school
That knowledge is not needed
That power does not rule

That war is not the answer
That young men should not die
Sit down young stranger
I wait for your reply

The answer is not easy
For souls are not reborn
To wear the crown of peace
You must wear the crown of thorns

If Jesus, had a reason
I'm sure He would not tell
They treated Him so badly
How could He wish them well

The parlor now is empty
There's nothin' left to say
My father has departed
My mothers gone to pray

There's rockets in the meadows
And ships out on the sea
The answers in the forest
Are carved upon a tree

John loves Mary
Does anyone love me?

Gordon Lightfoot,"The minstrel of the dawn is here
To make you laugh and bend your ear
Up the steps you?ll hear him climb
All full of thoughts, all full of rhymes
Listen to the pictures flow
Across the room into your mind they go
Listen to the strings
They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings
The minstrel of the dawn is he
Not too wise but oh so free
He'll talk of life out on the street
He'll play it sad and say it sweet
Look into his shining face
Of lonelines you?ll always find a trace
Just like me and you
He's tryin? to get into things
More happy than blue

He'll ask for nothing but his pride
Just sit him down upon that chair
Go fetch some wine and set it there

Listen to the strings
They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings

Just like a step ?n fetchit here
He's like an old time troubador
Just wanting life and nothing more
Look into his shining eyes
And if you see a ghost don?t be surprised
Like me and you
He's tryin? to get into things
More happy than blue

The minstrel boy will understand
He holds a promise in his hand
He talks of better days ahead
And by his words your fortune?s read

Listen to the strings
They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings

I hope he?ll call before too long
And if you meet him you must be
The victim of his minstrelsy
He'll sing for you a song

Gordon Lightfoot,"I remember everything
I've learned about survival
I've walked with fools and kings
And I've even read the bible

There I came upon some lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
Your kingdom is in heaven

But I chose to live instead
Inside the shell they gave me
'til in spite of everything
Good fortune came to find me

I tried my best to run away
But I could not avoid the feelin'
Soon I was reelin' on my feet
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then

After I'd gone and let myself surrender
I didn't want to die at all
I thought I'd live forever

Then she gave me everything
A king could never borrow
But I twisted all her gifts
Her wisdom was my sorrow

So I left her cryin'
And roamed across the river
The angels offered me their hands
But I could not forget her

So I came to where she was
By river, road and reason
I slept beneath her window
In the moonlight summer season

But I could not go inside
I heard the sound of laughter
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then

After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow
I didn't want to live no more
Nor face the bright tomorrow

Then I remembered everything
I've learned about survival
Havin' walked with fools and kings
I've even read the bible

I remember all those lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
It will not pass inspection

And still I think when I'm alone
Away from all night splendor
If gold could buy one night with her
I wish I had some to send her
",Apology,1969
Gordon Lightfoot,"Upon the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreaming of a kiss

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

But now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Dreaming of a kiss

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone
To take her home",Bitter Green,1969

Gordon Lightfoot,"I looked into a windowpane
Last evening in a city far away
I was feelin' sad and blue
I wondered then if I should really stay
Wanting someone to be with me in the light of this uncertain time
Waiting by the window for the man inside
To please make up his mind

Will you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

I walked along the roadway to a fountain
Where lovers come to meet
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell
He didn't have enough to eat
He said, ""good sir you look so kind
And though the years have stripped me to the bone
It seems I am the better man
For in this place I've never walked alone

Will you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

""where will you be, my friendly, when your
Telephone ain't givin' out no calls
And when the seasons come to haunt you
Will you still find springtime in the fall
And when you're on your island
Will you wave at every ship that passes by
And will you feed a hungry man
I thank you, sir,
Now I'll just say goodbye""

Don't you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

And the brave must fall to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

What a wonderful place this world would be
All strife would end, we could start again
And dreams like these must not pass on

Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

Gordon Lightfoot,"Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run
Phantoms on the winter sky, together they do come
Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind
Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again

All the games are ended now, their voices have been stilled
Their fathers built the tools of war by which they all were killed
Their mothers made the uniforms, showing which side they were on
And the young boys were the middle men for the guns to prey upon

You've seen the fires in the night, watched the Devil as he smiles
You've heard a mother's mournful cry as she searches for her child
You've seen the lines of refugees, the faces of despair
And wondered at the wise men who never seem to care

Goodbye, you lost children, God speed you on your way
Your little beds are empty now, your toys are put away
Your mother sings a lullaby as she gazes at the floor
Your father builds more weapons and marches out once more

Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run
Phantoms on the winter sky, together they do come
Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind
Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again

Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring

You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure
You'll never be the same

If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender

That life is not a game

You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender
You'll soon be on a one night tour
Forgetting your own name

You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender
For the light so warm and pure
Will draw you like a flame

The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender
Shadows dancing everywhere
Like flowers in the rain

You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender
With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again

Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly
There is no way that I can see
You living by yourself

Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly
Your presence means so much to me
Much more that life itself

Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear
Please cast away the clothes you wear
And give your love to me

Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun
I'd love to see you laugh and run
As naked as the sea

If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender
Don't try and get the best of her

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time

On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone

And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night

Her long flowing hair came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love

And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget
Then left with the answer I've never found yet

""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this
Belong to someone?""
""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die
We must almost be born""

So if you should ask me what secrets I hide
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide

The perfume that she wore was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well

And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night
",Affair on 8th Avenue,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon
And the anchors have been weighed
From Miami to Nassau
She's bound across the waves

She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay
Into the open sea
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it

Now the many years she's been to sea
She's seen the better times
She gives a groan of protest
As they cast away her lines

And the grumble of her engines
And the rust along her spine
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'

But the sands run out within her heart
A tiny spark glows red
It smolders through the evening
There's laughter overhead

Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt
And the drinks are passed around
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'

Now it's midnight on the open sea
And the moon is shinin' bright
Some people join the party
And others say goodnight

There's many who are sleepin' now
It's been a busy day
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'

""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning
Let someone understand""
But her silent plea is wasted
In the playin' of the band

Everybody's dancin' on her deck
And they're havin' such a time
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""

Deep within the Yarmouth Castle
The fire begins to glow
It leaps into the hallways
And climbs and twists and grows

And the paint she wore to keep her young
Oh Lord, how well it burns
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'

Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast
The captain stands aloft
He calls up to the boatswain, says
""Boatswain, we are lost""

For the ragged hoses in the racks
No pressure do they hold
And the people down below will soon be dyin'

All amidships, oh she's blazin' now
It's spreadin' fore and aft
The people are a-scramblin'
As the fire blocks their path

The evil smoke surrounds them
And they're fallin' in their tracks
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'

Oh then the ship, Bahama Star
Comes steamin' through the night
She sees the Castle blazin'
And 'tis a terrible sight

""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries
""We'll save you if we can""
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'

""God help the ones who sleep below
And cannot find the way
Thank God for those we rescue
Upon this awful day""

Now the heroes, they are many
But the times are growin' slim
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'

Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'
She's cryin' like a child
You can hear her if you listen
Above the roar so wild

Is she cryin' for the ones who lie
Within her molten sides?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'

But the livin' soon were rescued
The ones who lived to tell
From the Star they watched her
As she died there in the swells

Like a toy ship on a mill pond
She burned all through the night
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'
",Ballad of Yarmouth Castle,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"Oh the neon lights were flashin'
And the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes
And the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead
And the wine was runnin' low
And the old man came home
From the forest 

His tears fell on the sidewalk
As he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare
But no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway
And the bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in
From the forest 

Up a dark and dingy staircase
The old man made his way
His ragged coat around him
As upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened
That he ended up this way
Getting lost like a fool
In the forest 

And as he lay there sleeping
A vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining
A face of one so dear
Who had loved him in the springtime
Of a long-forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom
In the forest 

She touched his grizzled fingers
And she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound
Of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside
In some forgotten town
Where the river runs down
From the forest 

With a mighty roar the big jets soar
Above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on
For the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier
The dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home
From the forest",Home from the Forest,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me

If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold
Would I stand in the marketplace before
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall
And shot by the man in blue

If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free
Would it mean anything to you

If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time
I would turn his head away to the river
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free
For everyone to see

If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me
",If I Could,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"The last time I saw her face, 
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me, 
Her lips were like the scented flowers 
Inside a rain-drenched forest
But that was so long ago 
That I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, 
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground she walked upon
Those were good day

The last time I held her hand, 
Her touch was autumn, spring and 
Summer, and winter too
The last time I let go of her, 
She walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets, 
A thousand months, a thousand miles
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, 
That's where she is

But that was so long ago 
That I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, 
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more
The last time I saw her face, 
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And she walked alone

The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves
Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten",The Last Time I Saw Her,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"From the railhead to the boatyard
From the factory to the farm
From the mine to the mill yard
I've weathered the storm

From the bar room to the bedpost
I've wasted my days, all I have is my drink
And the time left to think
While time slips away

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye

Just walk away and leave me alone
It's a long way back home

Now in case you should ask me
What it is that I've done
I'd say I'm a soldier
Who once had a son

But my son doesn't know me
That's his right to choose
Oh say, can you see? My best friend is me
I'm a friend I could use

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye

Just walk away and leave me alone
It's a long way back home

Now the pages have faded
The story grows cold
And the plot falls to ashes
Like the ruins of old

Those rats in my rafters
They're after my shoes
And anything else they can find on the shelf
I've said they could use

And just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye

Just walk away and leave me alone
It's a long way back home
It's a long way back home
",Long Way Back Home,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"All is well
I've made my peace where highways never end
Yesterday's a memory today is just a friend
For the mountains and Maryann are calling me again
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears 
All is well
I left the cold midwestern towns behind
There's a semi up the road ahead I'll take him in my time
For the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again
And the vagabond within me cries
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I won't feel the pain
For the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do 

All is well
As I swing up to the border bent for hell
And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well
But the mountains and Maryann are calling out to me
And I got my bedroll on my back 
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way 

All is well
I've made my peace and man, I'm feelin' fine 
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time
For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime
And the prairie towns go sailing by
Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leavin' you behind
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along
And the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do 

All is well
The foothills are coming into sight
Today is just a memory the future is tonight
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along 
And the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do",The Mountains and Maryann,1971
Gordon Lightfoot,"Rosanna makes my day begin
With kisses for a king
And coffee on a silver tray
She sees the shape I'm in
And if she should ever break away
I'd follow close behind her
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna
Rules my heart 

Rosanna knows the times I keep

And the shadows lick the walls
She knows when I'm asleep
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time
And all is well by nine
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna
Rules my heart 

Rosanna moves across the floor
Her perfume fills the air
As she walks beside my easy chair
I touch her hand once more
And I may never sleep again
I like the bag she put me in 

Rosanna knows the ways of a man
But not the way I feel
I don't really care what happens now
It's catch me if you can
For no matter what occasion should arise
She likes to sympathize
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna

Gordon Lightfoot,"She was something very special to me
The kind of girl you'd like to see
In a movie or a rosary 

She could be straight-laced or homespun 
Or free and easy on the run
She could be meek and mild or full of fun

She liked country lanes and aeroplanes
And cigarettes would make her strange
And when she wanted you she made it plain 

She would never say where she came from 
It didn't seem that she had anyone
To answer to or dwell upon 

She liked candlelight and good wine
And I would call her any time
Of day or night she didn't mind 

The was nothing that I wouldn't do
To prove to her my love was true
And she gave to me a dream or two 

There were times when she would never appear
For days and then she'd disappear
But now the days have turned to years 

I was something she could use
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes
Or any kind of good news 

Now the eastern sky is crimson and red
As I lie here in my lonely bed
And think about the things she said 

She said darling there will come a day
When I must run far away
I will go my love and you must stay 

She departed in the early spring

That's what walls are for 

I'm not ashamed
To listen to the fast-fallin' rain
In the morning upon my window
I'm not afraid to cry
I'm not ashamed to try
To be your friend once again

Walls are for shutting out the love we feel inside 

I'm not ashamed no to talk it over once again 
To rearrange my vocabulary
But I can't seem to find 
Any words to change your mind 
Because I left them all behind
And that's what words are for 

Words are for explaining the mistakes we might have made
Names are for calling when there's nothing left to say 

I'm not ashamed, no, to say that I've loved you well 
I'm not ashamed, and yet I know
I'm just a name, that's all
Scratched upon your wall

With a sign that just said ""mother""
When he heard a driver comin'
'Bout a half a mile away
Then he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by bolder dam that day
He was raised up in Milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singin' songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in Boulder I don't know

It was out in Arizona
That he heard the lady listenin'
To each word that he was sayin'
To each line that he would write

They talked about the weather
Ninety-eight point six and risin'
Down by Boulder dam that day

For a ride in the mornin' sun

And the sky is blue and the sea is green
Yesterday's a cabaret
Gowns of satin on ladies gay

Yesterday's a cabaret
Sounds of laughter on faces gray
Yesterday's a carousel
Catch the ring and all will be well

From the coast of California
Up to the Oregon border
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess
Sitting in a roadside diner

The big trucks rollin' by
I don't seem to know at times what's best
And still I'd like to tell her
That I miss her so, in north Ontario

If you're drivin' east to Reno
Or north to Mendocino
I hope you find your rainbow?s end
This highway is my rainbow

And though I might regret it
I'm so glad I said it way back when
And still I'd like to tell her
That I miss her so, in north Ontario

By a worn down weathered old mill
In the valley below where the river winds
There's no such thing as bad times
And a soft southern flame

She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round

When the new day begins
I go down to the cotton gin
And I make my time worth while to them
Then I climb back up again
And she waits by the door
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down

Like the sticky winds of winter
When they meet
When lonely lovers come to rest
Beneath the trees they do their best
But still they can't be free

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

If you go into the forest
Gaze up through the leaves
And see the sky is almost wild
You can learn to understand
What makes the forest greet the man
Like a mother's only child

In the north when when winter's claw
Relaxes now to keep the law
Of nature in control
People come and stand in line
To rob the forest of her wine
But they don't feel the cold

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

Love and maple syrup shine like
Like embers warm, like thoughts divine
They tell us it is spring
Love and maple syrup stir
The thoughts of people into words
Of songs that they can sing

Love and maple syrup goes together
Like the sticky winds of winter
When they meet
When lonely lovers come to rest
Beneath the trees they do their best
But still they can't be free

Gordon Lightfoot,"Never had much to say, he traveled alone with no friends
Like a shadowy ghost at dawn he came and he went
Through the woodland swiftly gliding, to the young maid he came gliding
Where she'd run to meet him, by the garden wall

Oh my sweet Miguel, I will never tell
No one will ever know, what I know too well
And he'd smile and lay his head on her breast and he'd say I have no fear
They're waiting for me to cross the border, to swim the river

'Cause I've done that before
To see my true loves smiling face
A hundred times or more
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried
I'll love you till I die

He was born to the south in Mexico they say
The child of a man who had soon gone away
But his mother loved him dearly and she would take him yearly
To the great Cathedral in St. Augustine

Oh my young Miguel, listen to the bell
Of my poverty you must never tell
And he cried himself to sleep in the night
And he vowed to make things right
So he took the gun down from the wall and he paid a call

He knew she'd understand
A lawman came to capture him
The gun jumped in his hand
Oh Miguel the mother cried
You must run son or you'll die

So the story is told of his true love cross the line
As strong as the oak and as sweet as the vine
And the child she bore him, came on the fateful mornin'
When they sent him to his final rest

Oh my sweet Miguel listen to the bell
No one will ever know, of what I know too well
Then she'd smile and lay the child on her breast
And she'd say I have no fear
I'm waiting for you to cross the border, to swim the river

To rise above the throng

For the children in her trust
And of her grave concern
For the likes of you and me and us

Crying though she was
She did speak these tender words
The things that I am
I could not change for any man

Ah, but she would not be still

And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Looking at the trees
So ill at ease
From sleep that will not come
That's me
Looking at the dawn
Knowing it's wrong
Still thinking of your love
That's gone

Wishing this was all a dream
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Looking at the rain
Feeling the pain
Of love lost running though
My brain
Looking at the wind
Watching it spin
The leaves along the street
You win

Waiting for a line to fall
Telling you it's all a big mistake
But the words won't come
I know I'd feel the same

Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor 

Didn't feel so cold and tired
Stretched out before her fire
Rollin' smokes and drinkin' up her wine
And I remember candlelight
And singing 'til we could not sing no more
Then fallin' warm asleep on Susan's floor 

Well now that my song is sweeeter
I think I'd like to greet her
And thank her for the favors that she gave
A stranger I came
My head bowed in the rain to her door
I sat and sang my songs on Susan's floor 

In the mornin' I'd go on
Buyin' kingdoms with my songs
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while
Warm in the sunlight of her smile

Well lots of time and songs have passed
I catch myself just looking back
Reliving all the wonder of those nights
That's where I'd be today
If I had only stayed one night more

I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny
You go with me everywhere
When I'm dreamin' you still share my lonely nights
Try to see my side
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm

And as I wander to the cities and the towns
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell

Gordon Lightfoot,"The songs of the wars are as old as the hills
They cling like the rust on the cold steel that kills
They tell of the boys who went down to the tracks
In a patriotic manner with the cold steel on their backs

The patriot's dream is as old as the sky
It lives in the lust of a cold callous lie
Let's drink to the men who got caught by the chill
Of the patriotic fever and the cold steel that kills

The train pulled away on that glorious night
The drummer got drunk and the bugler got tight
While the boys in the back sang a song of good cheer
While riding off to glory in the spring of their years

Well there was a sad, sad lady, weeping all night long
She received a sad, sad message from a voice on the telephone
Her children were all sleeping as she waited out the dawn
How could she tell those children that their father was shot down
So she took them to her side that day and she told them one by one
Your father was a good man ten thousand miles from home
He tried to do his duty and it took him straight to hell
He might be in some prison, I hope he's treated well

Well there was a young girl watching in the early afternoon
When she heard the name of someone who said he'd be home soon
And she wondered how they got him, but the papers did not tell
There would be no sweet reunion, there would be no wedding bells
So she took herself into her room and she turned the bed sheets down
And she cried into the silken folds of her new wedding gown
He tried to do his duty and it took him straight to hell
He might be in some prison, I hope he's treated well

Well there was an old man sitting in his mansion on the hill
And he thought of his good fortune and the time he'd yet o kill
Well he called to his wife one day, ""Come sit with me awhile""
Then turning toward the sunset, he smiled a wicked smile
""Well I'd like to say I'm sorry for the sinful deeds I've done
But let me first remind you, I'm a patriotic son""

I'm thinking of the lady who got lost along the way
And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done

I'm on my second cup of coffee, I still can't face the day
The room was filled with laughs as we danced the night away
But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done
The gentle sweet reminder of a daughter and a son

Sitting alone, my friends have all gone home
You never know when they'll come droppin' in
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls
Too young to understand how love begins

I'm on my second cup of coffee, I still can't face the dawn

Gordon Lightfoot,"I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you

I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?
I can't depend on love to defend me

I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me
",Can't Depend on Love,1972
Gordon Lightfoot,"Where did ya go when the snow lay on the ground
What did ya do when the rain began to fall
How did it feel when I looked through your soul
When was the last time you wanted my love
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden
How could you put yourself through like you did
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way

Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you
Where does it say love should last forever
When was the last time I told that to you

Gordon Lightfoot,"When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday

I have played on my guitar
In coffeehouses, hall and bars
Everyone that I call friend
Knows they will not be forgot

Trains and planes and rented cars
Singers, saints and other starts
I suspect them every one
They'll never change, it's too much fun

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there

When I stand on my own sod
It feels so good to be home, by God
The winter wind has turned my head
But I always came up warm somehow

Bottles, beads and cigarettes
And lovers that I ain't found yet
Pickin' with a friend till dawn
And singing all of those hi'way songs

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there

When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday

I would travel all my life
If loneliness was not the price
While headin' north across that line's
The only time I'm flyin'

My son, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run
No need to get bothered, I'll think about Monday
When Monday comes, it's two for one
Mister Hoot 'n Holler, gotta make a dollar

Another lazy mornin', I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two
The most delicious brew
Keepin' up with the joneses, I hope no one telephones us
I'd take a place in the country, but for now the old back yard
Looks to me like fifty acres of the roundest ground in town

Another lazy mornin', come supper time I'm gonna light my barbecue
Nothin' new, only that she loves me
And nothin' I know can change me, no need to get bothered
I do more livin' than it might seem
Some dream, livin' like a pauper, bless my darlin' daughter

I'd like to know what makes a man go, over land and sea
I guess it must get kinda lonesome, that's the way I used to be

Such fun, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run

Gordon Lightfoot,"She is my flower
And she blooms for the one who loves her best
The miners stop to watch as she walks
They know her love is not for sale
She will never fail me 'cause I know
I watch her grow
And the mother of a miner's child
Waits for me beside the kitchen door
She is my light
In this place where the darkness never ends
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend
She's the only one who listens when I tell her
I got less than I can spend
She knows the pace
Oh mother of a miner's child
Was away the coal dust from my face

When the night shift's done
She'll be waiting by the table when I come
Searchin' for another dream to chase
Oh mother of a miner's child
I know that you still think about the day
When we'll be movin' on
Remember dear old daddy and
The promise that I made to carry on

Sometimes I smile
In the cage where the cables softly hum
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone
But the mother of a miner's child
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home
Come Saturday
And he is just a miner's boy
I hope that he will find a better way

She is my flower
And she blooms for the one who loves her best
The miners stop to watch as she walks
They know her love is not for sale
She will never fail me 'cause I know

Early each day upon rising
I think of my lost love from over the sea
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart

There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air
Peace in the sound of the river
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul

I long to return to the place I remember
The taste of her lips close to mine
I could do much better if I could be strong
Come into my garden but leave me alone

I come to this garden, I come here to rest
Just as the night comes stealing
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die

Gordon Lightfoot,"I think this time you've said enough 
To make me want to leave this place
Still I keep coming back for more of 
The same to fan the dying flame
Here inside these walls that seem 
To move a little closer every day
There must be a way out of 
This crazy game we play out to the end
Let us just pretend a while
Think about the good things now and then

I think this time that was the best time 
That we two had ever known
We tried the handle of the house 
Upon the shore and found the open door
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam 
Doing dances on the floor
We were only playing like two children 
Who had stayed away from school
Two of us could not be wrong
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule

I think this time we've learned enough 
To know that nothing is the same
But still the pounding of my heart 
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange
Here among my thoughts of you 
I find a gentle longing to be free
There must be a way out of 
This crazy game we play out to the end
Take away the in-between
Think about the good things now and then
We will see the day when you 
Or I will stay or face up to the end
Let us just pretend a while
And think about the good things now and then",Now and Then,1975
Gordon Lightfoot,"In the name of love she came
This foolish winsome girl
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout
Swimmin' up stream in the world
And she said ""Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, 
In the name of love""

So I took her by the hand, 
She took me by the will
She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup
Looking for something to spill
And she said ""Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, 
In the name of love""

Rainy day people don't talk
They just listen till they've heard it all
Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you
They've been down like you
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two

If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love
Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow
They can't rise above
Rainy day lovers don't love any others
That would not be kind

That some soul has embraced
And somewhere between, 
In a no-man's land of dreams
The heart becomes the soldier

In circles 'round the sun 
Doing rings around the pole
When the mind is not sure 
What the heart will do next
The rock becomes the master 
And the road becomes what's left

Late one night when the moon shone down
We went to the mill on the edge of the town
She wore white, I wore black
The town was sleeping when we got back

The rock will not be harmed
Though man must be cheated 
Just as women must be charmed
And the mind is the light 
For the heart which cannot see
The soul becomes the stranger

Gordon Lightfoot,"I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes

The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free

The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me

And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time

Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight

And I know that you won't ever stray
'Cause you've been that way from day to day
For such a long, long time

And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me

And I know that I won't ever change

To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you, that you're beautiful",Beautiful,1975
Gordon Lightfoot,"Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a battered book into his hand
Standing like a prophet bold
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more

I have come o'er moor and mountain
Like the hawk upon the wing
I was once a shining knight
Who was the guardian of a king
I have searched the whole world over
Looking for a place to sleep
I have seen the strong survive
And I have seen the lean grown weak

See the children of the earth
Who wake to find the table bare
See the gentry in the country
Riding off to take the air

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a rusty sword into his hand
Then striking up a knightly pose
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more

See the jailor with his key
Who locks away all trace of sin
See the judge upon the bench
Who tries the case as best he can
See the wise and wicked ones
Who feed upon life's sacred fire
See the soldier with his gun
Who must be dead to be admired

See the man who tips the needle
See the man who buys and sells
See the man who puts the collar
On the ones who dare not tell
See the drunkard in the tavern
Stemming gold to make ends meet
See the youth in ghetto black
Condemned to life upon the street

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand
Then standing like a preacher now
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves
He gallops off across the dusty plain
In vain to search again
Where no one will hear

Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek",Don Quixote,1975

It was there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there
And the band was groovin'

When he gave a glance
That said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time
He would mistreat her

In her case she danced for him
Although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through
He knew she would be his loved one

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

He's playin' up in Michigan with a group
They call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone
The song was ended

But as she walks, she waits for him
The pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart she knows there is no way
She can hope to change him

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care

Whose presence in concealed
Whose nature is revealed
In a time bomb?

Who travel after whale
You'd storm the gates of hell itself
For the taste of a mermaid's tail

Whose duty was fulfilled

And protocol",Protocol,1976

Gordon Lightfoot,"The space shuttle ends where the subway begins
There's a tear on the face of the moon
Fromdusk until dawn they have searched all day long
But there's too many clues in this room
At best it is said we've been locked deep inside
Of an old sea man's chest full of charts
Where maps are contained and what's left of his brains
When his crew threw his balls to the sharks

All around the looking glass
Dancing to a tune
Sweeping out the house with a fine tooth comb
Which history's shown
Leads to ruin

In a word it is said that at times we must fall
But the worst of it all was the lies
We died for the cause just like regular outlaws
In the dust of an old lawman's eyes
In times best forgot there was peace there was not
In her pains mother earth came to bloom
Her children were born in the eye of the storm
And there's too many clues in this room

The power that is stored in the no man's land of chance
Is the someone who knows what they're doin'
The old soldiers say in they're own crusty way
We've got too many troops in this room

Sweeping out the house with a fine tooth comb

Gordon Lightfoot,"Go first in the world, go forth with your fears
Remember a price must be paid
Be always too soon, be never too fast
At the time when all bets must be laid
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children
Remember the woman who waits
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate

When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail
Beware of the dangers below
And the song that you sing should not be too sad
And be sure not to sing it too slow
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces
And know what they're doin' it for
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door

When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost
Consider the burden of fame
And he who is wise will not criticize
When other men fail at the game
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places
Be careful while bending the law
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door

When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal
Decide what it is that you need
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live
Or is it the mouth you must feed
Be known as a man who will always be candid
On questions that do not relate
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate",The House You Live In,1976

Hi, derry day in the month of May
Was the song the minstrel sang
To the good of Robin Hood
Maid Marion and all the gang

His aim was mean and his shot was clean
And his suit was the shade of evergreen
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear
When the sheriff was there, they were over here

Hi, derry doon in the month of June
Was the song the minstrel sung
To the good of Robin Hood's
Good name and a place to run

He loved strong ale and a run down jail
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed
There was no man on the sea or land
Who could get Maid Marion on the trail

Well there was a boy from Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his Ma
When she told him that he should go to school.
Well He'd stay away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn.
Well, he'd stand and listen carefully until at last he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly,
Well, he said ""Oh my, it's do or die, I've got to learn that auction cry,
Gonna make my mark and be an auctioneer.""

Five dollar bill?

Well the time went by and he did his best and all could see he did not jest.
He practiced calling bids both night and day
Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer.
And his pop said ""Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man
Selling things at auction using our good name.
Gonna send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
And you can take your place among the best.""

He come back home a full fledged auctioneer.
And the people would come from miles around
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.
And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and more,
He had to buy a plane to get around.

Gordon Lightfoot,"In this land of chance do we know right from wrong
Even at a glance we know the road is long
We don't owe a single thing to anyone

Most of us do not believe in come what may
Everything we fought for was in vain they say
Even when called upon to throw our lives away

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories

In these times of trial and uncertainty
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy

Our love for each other may not be explained
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories

To every unsung hero in the universe
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth
To all good men of reason may they never thirst

We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea
And faith that will remain through all eternity
We try to be helpful to the ones in need

Gordon Lightfoot,"Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

I've been around some walking on the down the street
Feeling as low as the shoes on the soles of my feet
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway

Many's the time I've wished that I were free
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

Whenever the thought seems better off left alone
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway

I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say
Try to believe me, I'll do anything that you say
Though it might grieve me, I'll do anything that you say
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say

I have loved and I have lost
Ever after I will be remembered

There have been times, I have seen the reaper
In the bad times, and in the good
I have bent down, I have touched the ground
Saying prayers and touching wood

In my fashion, I have been a father
I have loved and been loved in return
>From the ashes, I have kept the home fires
Burning after all was said and done

Do I look like the kind of guy

And had to stand on a stool
Because he couldn't come t' terms with a slide rule
Take a look around again

With all of these false emotions 
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just

She lights the sun and conjures up the rain 

Like any good gambler 
I was chained to a wishing well 
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend 
Don't look now, she's right behind you 
Looking for someone to take her inside 
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride 

I'm a little uneasy 
And there ain't much pride inside me 
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you 
It's too late now, she's not the same

I think I did all right
No failures are in sight
Only now and then

Do you remember when

Even if we're angels we can't ask 
To wander through the past

To be where we belong
Is all that I can ask
We can do it in the shade
As long as I have you
And the promises we made

Thank you for the promises we break
If you made a clean mistake
Well that's what love's about
No need to stand and shout
The truth is in your eyes
The answer lies within
No need to criticize

For the promises at hand
The abuse that we must stand
Is often heaven sent
They may not pay the rent
You never can be sure
When promises get bent

With my banjo in my hand
I don't need no long vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh
I wish that I could make the time
To be in biscuit city by and by
Oh the water is of emerald
And the beach is white as snow
And everyone's got money
And no place to go
In a land of milk and honey
It can really make you smile
And if I had a ticket
I would stay in biscuit city for a while

All the girls are in bikinis
All the boys are in the buff
With the baby in between and
That makes three of us
And the streets are all so quiet
And the walls are squeaky clean
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til
The town of biscuit city you have seen

I'd rather be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
Than take a big vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing

Places to go, people to chase
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste

Twenty-one years from the day I was born
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm
You come to me

You were the girls with the summer sunshine
In your eyes and in your smile
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here

I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram
You can stick my money in an old tin can
I think I fell in love again

I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine
I was almost gone, I was over the line
I said what's come over me

You were the girl with the sound of springtime
In your songs and in your voice
You were the one I thought, loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you

I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze

She leans with the wind
She cries turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me
But I don't mind
Only now and then
When her branches lean beneath the snow
She's knotty but nice
Reaching for the sky
She don't like snow 'n ice
To leave things as they stand
Is my advice
She's been good to me
So I tend to go there when I can

She's my knotty pine
Such a pretty scene
She tries to be kind
She gives birds a home
And shelters them
In her coat of green
She's as green as evergreen can be

She's a real delight
When little breezes call
To ruffle up her skin
All her sap runs free
And sticks to me
Hidden deep within
I will be her slave eternally

She leans with the wind
She crys turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me
But I don't mind
Only now and then

So other than nothin' what's new
The water's still flowin' through the rose on my skin
This here tattoo is for you

The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste anytime a-puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away I can see it

Go sailin' on by as it slips through my fingers
The bow and the wave never wait for tomorrow
They just keep on rollin' as straight as an arrow, good night

Girl of my dreams you get better each day
I wish I could see you somehow
Girls that I love is there no other way
This here tattoo is for now

I'd been out drinkin' all day
I got carried away at the parlor last night
This summer rose is for you it's no wonder

I bothered to wander back into the parlor
It's red and in bloom and it's more than one color
It lives on forever for just a few dollars, good night

Whatever you think of me I'm still your friend
So baby whatever you do
Now that it's taken its permanent home
This here tattoo is for you

The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste any time a-puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away, you know time doesn't

Wait for nobody to find what they're after
It just keeps on rolling on down the deep canyons
And through the green meadows into the broad ocean, good night

Soon I will go forth
To that wild and barren land
Where nature takes it's course
Whispers of the wind
Soon I will be there again
Bound with a wild and restless drive
That pulls me from within
And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the north
Soon I will return again
To those endless afternoons
In sunshine and in rain
Whispers of my love
Days and weeks on end
I will share my thoughts of her
In prayers that I will send

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the north
The river and the shore
In the land that tested eskimos
Ten thousand years before
Whispers of my heart
In the tracks of animals
I will leave my footprints there
To lie beneath the snow

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the wind
I will feel it sting
I will see it rise and fall
I will hear it sing
The sound is like a song to me
It takes away the pain
The river is the melody
And sky is the refrain

And we can fly away

If I can break the spell that is in me
Any fool would know where to go
I guess I'd better send a mayday
If I find me a rainbow's end

How will I find it then

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you

If I can last, wait until the wind dies

And this is such a thin disguise

Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
We'd do anything for love

Once or twice
In my loneliness I watched the world go by
There was I
One too many miles beyond where you might say
Some luck was due, after all

We could have touched the sky
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love

Ohh, I would try any means
To have you in all my dreams because
You'd do anything for love

Not long ago as I remember
Once upon a dark and windy day
When love looked like a dying ember
Before you came to call
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet

'Cause in my life
There in my mind in it now shines
A guiding light
Never again will I lose my way

Ohh, I would not tell a lie and
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love

Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love

West of the turnpike
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest

As I lie down, toss some thoughts around
Dreams I'm told will come true if you
Believe in those who love you right now

Sea of dreams I long for you
Forget about the others
This is my hike, you can come if you like
To feel good, I would help you if I could

But I am out here searching
For the things that might have been
I need no more reminders
Not one love letter have I seen

And that's a pretty good start
The ocean is where lovers meet again
Sea of dreams by all means
Float me out of danger until then
Forever amen

It's a long, long hike
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight

The road is paved with moonbeams
There are faces that I knew
They all came back to haunt me
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you

It takes a bit of my heart
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore
Sea of dreams from now on

Forget about all the others
Back where the line forms
Destination sea of storms
By all means ever onward sea of dreams

Put me somewhere east of midnight
Along about daylight
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest

If we could just lie down, love
Toss some thoughts around
It's a tough and a dirty long hike
You can come if you like

If we could just lie down
Toss some thoughts around

What's a part of the past
Have a little laughter if you please

I won't even mind if it takes awhile
I've got time on my hands
I feel another chapter in the breeze

And somebody touched my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody stole my heart away
Nobody's sayin' their sorry

It's a mighty sweet music
You can dance all night
Put some wood on the fire right now
Ecstasy made easy

Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name
Or just another patron with a smile?
Let me analyze you, are you a flame
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?

Somebody found my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody touched my heart last night
Somebody set me in flight

It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put flame on the old iron stove

It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put some fire on the old iron stove

On that southern sea
To sea what ecstasy was worth

What is mine, I will share
We've got things that we can do without
Most anytime, anywhere

Every little daydream that appears in all we do
Gives us some problems of our own

And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along

Paper matches in the afternoon
Cups of tea and all of that Zen
I think, it's time we took a walk outside
It seems there is no oxygen

This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone
I believe, it's best we carry on
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along

Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust
When we get back where we belong
If you ever turn that page again
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along

No prima donna ways

And times is tough these days

Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him

End of my story
The rest is history
She in all of her glory
He lived quietly

He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the skies above
In a way it was for them
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

You look like the moon glow
That follows me home
Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone

First to come are the midgets
A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id

Songs of the season
Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one

Hang on Mr. Barnum
Hang on Jenny Lind

Where eternity begins

We will let it all hangout
Go hand in glove

Though they are not connected, each and every one is true
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone

I just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind
I just let it ride

I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found

He just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot
They just let it ride

One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night

They just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
I'm gonna let it ride

Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon

How many songs still unwritten?
How many ships
Of the line have come and gone?

In the good old days
May they never be forgotten
They had heavy wind
Or they had no wind at all

It is midnight on the ocean
Had a real long trip
I have been at sea all winter

When my ship came in
I was givin' up the ghost
I think I should be
Leavin' those passing ships alone

When the sea runs high
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady
And I think of you
In the warmth of your home and family

When love is true
There is no truer occupation
And may this gale
Blow us to the ones we love

As long as I'm a ghost you can see

If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstore sells
When you reach the part where the heartaches
Come the hero would be me
Heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just to hard to take

I walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two, a movie queen
To play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love lets be real

I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie about a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
The story always ends
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feeling that you left

I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back",If You Could Read My Mind,1987
Gordon Lightfoot,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called 'Gitche Gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early.

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'.
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the Gales of November came slashin'.
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind.

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'.
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya.
At Seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril.
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.
They might have split up or they might have capsized;
May have broke deep and took water.
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion.
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
The islands and bays are for sportsmen.
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the Gales of November remembered.

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral.
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'Gitche Gumee'.
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early!",Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald [LP Version],1988

In the sky it looks like rain
The same old town with the same old streets

Either step up or step back

I have no wish to repent

I was born to fight
So you'd best leave me alone

Or much less than I should own

Gordon Lightfoot,"His father was a man who could never understand
The shame on a red man's face
So they lived in the hills and they never came down
But to trade in the white man's place

It was early in the spring when the snow had disappeared
They came down with a bag of skins
In the fall of the year of 1910
Daddy died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend. 

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did 
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
But the boy stayed back till he come to his end
And he run like the wind from Cherokee Bend. 

Now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand
And she prayed to her spirit kin
It was warm in the lodge in the Kentucky hills
On the day when the boy came in

Then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door 

Till they thought that it never would end
And he told her the tale of the terrible affair
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied

For three long days and three long nights
They wept and they mourned and then
She returned to her work and her weavin'
And they tried to forget about Cherokee Bend

Now the boy wasn't big but he hunted what he could
And they lived for a time that way
But the food run low and the meat went bad 
And she said to the boy one day

I'm leaving tonight and I never will return 
>From the land of my Spirit Kin
You must take what you need and trade what you can 
For a Red Man's grave down in Cherokee Bend

It wasn't very long till she closed her eyes
And he wrapped her in a robe
He found her a place on the side of the hill 
And he buried her in the snow

Early in the spring he was seen in the town 
With his load looking ragged and thin
Not a year had gone by till he stood once again 
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend

He was ten years tall and a Redskin too
So he hadn't much face to save
And the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned
At the talk of a criminal's grave

Then the man from the east didn't smile when he said 
You're the son of that Indian scum
If you value your hide then you better abide 
By the white man's rules here in Cherokee Bend. 

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied

And he spit on the floor of the government store
And it served him to no good end
At the close of the day they had taken him away 
To the white man's school down at Cherokee Bend

It's been 21 years since the boy disappeared
Where he run to, nobody knows
But they say he fell in with a man named Jim
And he rides in the rodeos

And they say he returns all alone to a place 
Hidden deep in the Kentucky glen
And it's pretty well known who hauled up the stone 
To the grave on the hill above Cherokee Bend

Gordon Lightfoot,"I'm sailing down the summer wind
I got whiskers on my chin
And I like the mood I'm in
As I while away the time of day
In the lee of Christian Island

Tall and strong she dips and reels
I call her Silver Heels
And she tells me how she feels
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'
But for one more day she would like to stay
In the lee of Christian Island

I'm sailing down the summer day
Where the fish and seagulls play
I put my troubles all away
And when the gales comes up I'll fill my cup
With the whiskey of the Highlands
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip
From the lee of Christian Island

Tall and strong she slips along
I sing for her a song
And she leans into the wind
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'
When the summer ends we will rest again

My mind is an endless wire
I got both feet on the ground
I ain't got no one for hire

I ain't got a thing to show
My lines have all expired
So don't go foolin' around
And set my wheels afire

Down in the dark of a burnt out soul
There's a few good second hand dreams
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you

Down in the black of a bottomless hole
There's a few good second hand scenes
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue
Where the sea runs green

I ain't got nothin' to give
My life is an endless climb
My love's a paperback dream
I don't have nothin' but time

And the cats are in the shed
And the river tells a story
At the window by my bed
If you listen very closely
Be as quiet as you can
In the yard you'll hear him
It is the pony man 
We're always there to greet him
When he tumbles into town
He leads a string of ponies
Some are white and some are brown
And they never seem to kick or bite
They only want to play
And they live on candy apples
Instead of oats and hay 

And when we're all assembled
He gives a soft command
And we climb aboard our ponies
As in a row the stand
Then down the road we gallop
And across the fields we fly
And soon we all go sailing off
Into the midnight sky 

And as we gaily rock along
Beside a ripplin' sea
There's Tom 'n Dick 'n Sally
And Mary Joe and me
And the pony man is leading
Cause he's travelled here before
And he gives a whoop and a holler
At Mr. Moon's front door 

And as we stop to rest a while
Where the soda river glides
Up to the slip comes a pirate ship
To take us for a ride
And the pony man's the captain
And the children are the crew
And we go in search of treasure
And laugh the whole night through 

And when the hold is filled with gold
And the sails begin to strain
And the deck's piled high with apple pie
We head for port again
And down the whirling starcase
So swift our ponies fly
And we're safely in our beds again

Call it midnight, feelin' bad

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow

The road to love is littered
By the bones of other ones
Who by the magic of the moment
Were mysteriously undone

Or the shadow of a dream?
Is it wrong to be in love?
Could it be the finest love I've ever seen?
Set it free

Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Please kiss me gently, darling
Where that river runs away
From the mountains in the spring time
On a blue and windy day

Where there's beauty all around
As the shades of night grow deep
When the morning stars grow dim
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep
Let it go

Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Gordon Lightfoot,"Oh the gist of it all is the first day of fall is the day when my ship 
Will set sail
The best of all friends will say good-bye again there's still time for 
One last glass of ale
We'll sail away proudly, our backs to the wall on a southwind and lots 
Of good cheer
And when we've looked over the white cliffs of Dover, We'll be in Bahama 
Next year
From Bermuda on down the Triangle around us will teach us a lesson or 
Two
There's many a mate who unevenyly stated the course he had charted was 
True
""Don't worry 'bout me,"" he said ""Go down below, give a certified sailor 
A turn,
Just sip on your rum or I'll give you my thumb and say, son you got 
Something t' learn!""

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip from an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of the dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight I might have her at my fingertips

Oh the best of all things is the first day of spring when when the water 
Runs heavy and fast
The mermaids have all gone to Davy Jones' Ball
And it seems their first trip was their last
They had so much fun
They don't wish to return
To the beach where they lay all day long
They'd rather stay under
And boy it's no wonder
When all the rock lobsters roll on
It's a mighty fine way to be found

Triangle Triangle 
Oh see my ship dangle
We're bound for Bahama my friend
Like lovers like danger
Like babies like mangers
But that's where my storybook ends
Like soldiers of fortune, believers in God
And all kings without crosses to bear
All sweepers and cleaners
With no misdemeanors
Should try the triangle out there

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip
From an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight 
I might have her at my fingertips

When she took her last tumble
The sea bottom rumbled
There was no confusion or blame
The captain said ""Men we must answer again to the sea so ye may not 
Complain""
And as they lay sleeping down there in the deep
With their faces turned up to the stars
A tuna fish turned
To a mermaid in bed and said 
""There goes another sandbar""

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found

Gordon Lightfoot,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called 'gitche gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'gitche gumee'
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early",Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,1988
Gordon Lightfoot,"Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowin' what to do
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied
With knowin' I got no one left to blame
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Let me slip away on you

And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside

Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land

Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found

And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops

In the mansion of the governor
There's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing
And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season

They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake

The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy

To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait

The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach

Gordon Lightfoot,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real

But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
Built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all

And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay

For they looked in the future and what did they see
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands

Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow

Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow

Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away

We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done

We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done

So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead

Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil

For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real

Gordon Lightfoot,"Sit by my side come as close as the air
Sharin' a memory of grey
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play
Of changes 

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade
Of changes 

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn
Of changes 

Passions will part to a warm melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls
Of changes 

Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shore

Gordon Lightfoot,"I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'

Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
But I was young and able
When I came out the other end
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
Unreadable

I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white, a face of brown
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
For a stranger

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me""

I came down to live alone in New York
The city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
Were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving

Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died
Where no one knew them
Beause they couldn't win

There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
Where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
Or if it mattered what they did
Or if they lived

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me

I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'

And there were prophets in the squares
And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""
There were lovers in the park
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it

And there were preachers of the Word and poets
Who were never heard, I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn
The measure of the lie they're livin'

I heard a young musician play in a place
Where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
And offered their best wishes
That's how it is

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Gordon Lightfoot,"When first I did appear upon this native soil
All up and down this country at labor I did toil
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run 

When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said Who are you and what would your name be
I said I have no home and I am no man's son 
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

So I swung an axe as a timberjack
And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds 

I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide

Gordon Lightfoot,"Oh, when he was a man, my father would stand
I never saw him run
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend
The strength of his will was the tool of his trade
And he did his work well

Till the powers that be took a liking to him
And they traded his body for a cold empty shell

Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down

Oh, when I was a youth, I found the truth
In the eyes of a friend
There wasn't anyone could make the light dim
And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win
And the learning was good

Till the powers that be to a liking to him
They traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood

When I was a child and my mother smiled
At the cradle she bought
For the little tot she held to her breast
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love
It was all that I heard

Till the powers that be took a liking to me
And they told me that love was a four-letter word

Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got one life to live
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down

And now I've got a place, I got a worried face
And a question in mind
Please let me find a reason somehow
Why some reap the harvest while other men die
And the joker runs wild

And if powers that be take a liking to us
Then we all must return to the ways of a child
We all must return to the ways of a child

So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down

With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was grooving
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?

In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him

She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
Where'll I go, what'll I be?

I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get

I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned
That any time I've wandered I always have returned

Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band

Now have you seen the harbor cried Marie Christine
Have you seen the jagged rocks in the waters in between
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh save me if you can
For if you do I promise you I'll never sail again

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched lot
Now gather all your photographs and don your coats of blue
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you

When at first I saw Marie Christine the woman that she was
I signed aboard to man her sails and honor well her cause
I christened her with old champagne and I drove her to the west
Of all the men who sailed on her, in truth I sailed her best

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band

Now come all you would be sailors
All you would be sailors, oh, all you would be sailors
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you

Gordon Lightfoot,"Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Ring around the rosy 
And I'll catch you if I can
And if you don't say may I, 
Then you'll have to start again
But first you must indulge me 
And count from one to ten
Let the game begin

I adore you when you touch me
Pin the tail upon the donkey, 
You will surely win
And if you don't say may I, 
Then I'll pass the cake around
And I won't give you any, 
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat soap, anyhow

Red light, green light, 
Blue light, yellow light
You can take three giant steps 
Or a baby step will do
But if you don't say may I, 
Then I'll march you out the door
Where you'll be contemplating 
The numbers one to four
I hope you're keeping score

'Cause if you don't say may I, 
Then I'll get you with the hose
And spoil your Sunday clothes 
Will it please you if I tease you
While you're at the spindry, 
I'll pass the pie around
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat blackbird anyhow

There's four and twenty reasons 
Why it can't be wrong
How long have you been gone

Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers",May I,1993
Gordon Lightfoot,"Beyond the wild misty mountain
Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow 
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea
When will you love me
As I love thee 

I have no gold to give her
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her 
Into my heart so strong so true
When will you love me
As I love you

Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow 
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea

Down from your sky

That cling so desperately
Must fly before the cold October winds
Their simple lives have ended
Must they be born to die again 

Oh may the light of freedom shine
For all the world to see

Through all the years to be 

For soon the leaves will die
And the long hard wind will blow
May this world find a resting place 
Where the peaceful waters flow",Peaceful Waters,1993

Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

And only God can lead the people back into the faith again
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord",Pride of Man,1993

Gordon Lightfoot,"Early in the morning when the dew is on, each and every rose bud, you will find me gone.
So knock me down and pick me up and knock me down again,
Break my heart steal my gold and slander my good name.
Seven lonely hours on the morning train takes me to a place where I won't come back again.

Seven lonely Pullmans speeding down the line taking me away from an old love of mine.
Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines 
In some hidden valley where the twirling river twines.

Where the fish swim up and down and the sparkling water falls,
Where the thunder rolls and the lonely puma calls,
Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name,
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again.
Somewhere in the wilderness I'll build a cabin small, then forget so I won't remember you at all.",Sixteen Miles (To Seven Lakes),1993
Gordon Lightfoot,"The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top
The snow is softly fallin'
The air is still within the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly callin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are liftin'
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane
Where webs of snow are driftin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two

Gordon Lightfoot,"Well I got my mail late last night
A letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too
To take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Ooooh oooo oo whu hu hoo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo 

Well I bin out here many a long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I bin stood up I bin shook down
I bin dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I bin up tight most every night
Walkin' along the streets of this old town
Not a friend to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down
'Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I look over yonder across the plain
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal 
And Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Now here I am with my hat in hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round
And I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail 
Won't carry me home to the one I love",Steel Rail Blues,1993

Don't linger in time or finger what's mine
Don't make me do what you wouldn't do yourself

And you need someone to share it
Tell me girl, I'll try to make amends

When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me, baby can't you see that I know how it is
I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this

I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes
It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found

Gordon Lightfoot,"I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea
In back of the eight ball in some misery
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home
Any way I can lose myself

Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away

They sailed right up to me, I said, ""What's it all about
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel""

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now

Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away

One more day on the calendar in my mind
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home
Any way I can lose myself

Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away

Gordon Lightfoot,"Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride
I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side
I'd rather press on, I don't wanta rest easy
Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day

Anyway, that is all I've gotta say
I'd rather be by the seaside
Than be playing a one night stand
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams

I will change things if I can
I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew

You will never know what blue is
Until you have played the game
Till you live life in solitaire where
No one knows your name

I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy
Have it anyway you will
I will be with you right up until
The spell is broken and all is well

If you'd rather be by the seashore
Well, I sure can understand
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene
I would change things if I can

I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine
But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes
And all of the good times makes me blue

Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew

Gordon Lightfoot,"Does the light of passion still burn bright?
Only love would know my imagination
Tells me I'm a pent-up fool in the deep end of the pool
Is the light of passion burnin' tonight?
Only love would know, only love would know

She lives on the other side, you wanna know the reason why
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says
Everywhere you go
Is the light of passion burnin' bright?
Everywhere you go, only love would know

You think, you've been wronged again
Oh what a way to treat a friend
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize
She ain't the kind who would soon step aside
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride
Everywhere she goes, only love would know

In the days gone by I came to believe
Everything is trust, all the rest is dust
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?
Only love would know, only love would do

She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain
She says no, you say yes
And that's how it should be I guess
Only love would know

May the light of love surround you tonight
Everywhere you go, only love would know

You think, you were wrong until
You learned once and for all it's still
One more lesson on the way
Or that is what it seemed to say

She's not the kind who would soon step down
Not the kind you would try to walk around
When only a thought would go very well
You can tell by the touch
Ah but only love would know

Passion burnin' bright
Tears of passion late at night
Is the light of passion burning bright?
Everywhere you go, only love would know
",Only Love Would Know,1993
Gordon Lightfoot,"There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry
And I will always love that sound until the day I die
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast
Like an echo from the past
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest
We will be returning to the things that we love best
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad
And the scrimshaw that he had
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast
Of a specter from the past
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast
See an image from the past
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast",Restless,1993
Gordon Lightfoot,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride

Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through?
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child who cries when innocence dies

Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong
",Ring Them Bells,1993
Gordon Lightfoot,"I have been down in valley of tears
I have stood on the highest peak
For the best part of a week
Battered and bruised I had pulled myself through
Every scene I would never repeat

I have hung out with the beasts of the field
And with them I've spent many a long nights
Got in some awful bad fights
I came unstuck, I was down on my luck
And I'm still gettin' over the bites

Sounds of my own heart breaking
Not to mention my mind
?Nothing can hurt me? a small voice said
Into a mike, take a hike

No one will lead me astray anymore
You are welcome to try if you like
Welcome to try if you like

I had been down in the valley so long
I had almost run out of respect
Got in right up to my neck
Battered but wise to the truth and the lies
That no layman would ever accept

Reachin' for all of the good things in life
Can provide some surprises I guess
It be may the way we are dressed
These threads that you see mean so little to me
They don't count when they put us to rest

Late about dusk I would start to feel
One more day had been lost
Nothin' I'd say ever seemed to convey
How I felt with that I have dealt

All of my children are healthy and sane
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

Sitting alone in the Blue Ridge Saloon
Is no place for an angel to be
Ladies make faces at me
Battered but clean I had pulled my machine
Off the road, I was too tired to see

Wearing a smile like the rim of a cup
I will get down to my final point
There is no one left to anoint
And the sowing of seed was it good, yes indeed
It thrills me but only to a point

Use your imagination
Try every trick in the book
My mother said with the life that I led
I'd be broke, holy smoke

All of my children are healthy and sane
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

If they want to preach and are not within reach
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

Gordon Lightfoot,"If I had a dollar, if I had a cent
I would play most anywhere if it would pay my rent
I'd be livin' on the downside in my old apartment
For the rest of my days

People always ask, why the world is on the run?
People like you and like me
Is it really true you can really never win?
Movin' to the upside, tell me when does the fun begin

Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather
We will go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together
Or be livin' on our own, in a cabin in a meadow
Or meanderin' alone, we can face the world forever or we'll

Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride

People often ask me just the way it must feel
To be standing up here with you down there
Let it now be known that throughout all of these years
I have been wearing polka dot underwear

Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather
We will go just you and me to gather crabapples together
And be wandering along toward a cabin in the meadow
Or meandering alone, we can face the world together or we'll

Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride

People always ask why the world is on the slide?
People like you and like me
Is it really true there will be no peace left to hide?
Turning to the upside, when does the fun begin

Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather
We might go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together
Or be livin' on our own in a cabin in a meadow
And the cows will come home they can face the world forever and we'll

Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride

I can't give my heart to you
Or tell you that I'll sing your name up to the sky
I can't lay the promise down
That I'll always be around when you need me

Now I may not be alone each time you see me
All along the street or in a small cafe
But still I won't deny you or mistreat you
Baby, if you let me have my way

I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry
For all the things that I might say that make you cry
I can't say I'll always do the things you want me to
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try

Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me

Clouds are gatherin' over my head
That chill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love, goodbye

Oh, how I wish your heart could see
How mine just aches and breaks all day
Come on home and take away
This ribbon of darkness over me

Come on home and take away
Ribbon of darkness over me

Your wishes would come true if I had my say
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song
Remind us of a love we knew
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays

Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble

Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass
I can't remember how it was I got here
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars
Out there among the bars

Hang on ye drifters now
You got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide
Where ever you may travel

I know I should not complain because life's been good to me
It feels real good to be stranded on my own
Be that as it may be, we are what we are
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars
Of yesteryear

Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble

You got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide
Where ever you may travel

Gordon Lightfoot,"I saw two dreamers dreamin'
They almost caused a spark
I saw two lovers in paradise right back at the start
I saw two minds in the world set free
But it almost broke my heart
Isn't it strange to be right now havin' you close to me?

Much to my surprise

I saw two schemes schemin'
They almost caused a lark
They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree
Right back at the park
They were like two ships
And they sailed right by each other in the dark

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play?
So much for your disguise

I saw two souls out searchin'
They said their last goodbyes
And I saw two hearts of passion then
Much to my surprise
I saw two hearts on passion bent
The kind which mystifies

It is so strange to be right now
Having you on my knee
Much to my surprise

I gotta make you see somehow

I saw two minds that wandered
They almost caused a wreck
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea
When someone cried hit the deck
I saw two minds in the world set wise
But I almost broke my specs

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play
So much for your disguise

My little love who is never unkind

Hand me the guitar, there I'll go
I would rather make a living instead
Instead of bein' in the red

Come and meet me by the neon light

See the people movin' all around
On the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street
Longest street in the world they say
Summertime soon slips away
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street

Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow

See the children jumpin' all around
See the parents looking up and down
Upon the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street
It's a mean street if you choose
It's a lean street when you loose
An' in between street when you cruise along Yonge Street

Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow

It's the longest street in the world
With the most feet in the world
Another street where boy meets girl on Yonge Street
See the people walkin' up and down
See the people movin' all around

Even late at night when the streets are all aglow

Once upon a time my life would be obsessed

Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait

Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground

I was in my stride, always at my game
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame
I was in demand, always in control
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold

Once upon a time, I was in a daze
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history

Now that I am old, let me rest a spell
All that I am told, I can never tell
Never in my life, never will it pass
I am still alone, remembering at last

And the nights to come are long are slow to go
Well now she's up and left me and when walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn wind begins to blow
All dressed up in red velvet and he high heeled shoes so fine
And the nights to come are long and slow to go

Well if I had only know before we kissed
You can't keep red velvet on a poor dirt farm like this

Oh now she's gone and left me and went walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn winds begin to blow

Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go

Maybe they think, he is past his prime

Uncle Toad lived in the wood out back
Lived in the shade of a utility shack
He looked in at the big brick house
At the girls as quiet as a mouse

Out by the back door, look at him smile

Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child
That I knew and a big harvest moon
That shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon

And I need to be there when the autumn wind goes
Singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country song
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town
And I bought you a dime diamond ring
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings

And I need to be there when the world
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country way
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play
While the young ones slept overhead
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said

And I need to be there when the autumn wind
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers

Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found

When I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence
And the world had turned so cold

Drink yer glasses empty now
Was all that they were told

Drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why

We'd love to take life over that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us once again

Better drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the line
You got one less cause in the world
To be leaving for

Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder

I'd like to take things one at a time
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal or borrow
You got another hill to climb

So drink yer glasses empty now

Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky

When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us of the plains

Just drink yer glasses empty now

To be leaving for

Of a backwards point of view

I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started
What to my eyes appeared as dust
Became a vision I don't know

What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the day wore on I knew
Another lonely night could never be

If there's is a reason you might try and forget
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?

I was caught drifting disappearing from the land
Whitecaps in profusion all around me
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength
To sail upon the raging sea

If theres a reason for the way that life is
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it

Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the days wore on I knew
Another lonely night with you could never be

I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real
All that you can ever do when love is reveal

Sometimes I every try why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?

He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew
And the place that he loved best
Was the waters to the west
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away
In the mating of the day he was the king

Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes
And so he lived at sea a hundred years

His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue

Big Blue passed away to his natural decay
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue

Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend
And the killing never ends, it just goes on

To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze

And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there

Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused

Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck

Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face

It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold

know

I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you

I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price

From a long and a sleepless night
She returned again this morning
From her long and restless flight

And my red hollow eyes
Did not show her much surprise
As she lay right down beside me
Like she never said goodbye

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

It was all I could bear
Just to watch her lying there
Disowned and ragged princess
With the sun locked in her hair

So cold, so frail
With her mind locked in a jail
The victim of confusion
Never knowing she could fail

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

So I rocked her to sleep
Then I got up on my feet
And the day was filled with sunshine
As I gazed across the street

And the door seemed to say
Over here, step this way
The station is for travelers
Even you must ride someday

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

Please help me station master

Forgive me if I'm weary
I ain't had much, much time to smile

It's time for a summertime dream

On a trip on down to wonderland
In love among the flowers
Where time gets lost with no straw boss
Tallyin' up the hours
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove
To old Bill Skinner's stream
Do tell at the noonday bell
It's time for a summertime dream

Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees
And down below's a pond I know
You can swim in it if you please
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down
You can see what chivalry means
Let's steal away in the noonday sun
It's time for a summertime dream",Summertime Dream,1999
Gordon Lightfoot,"Say what you will, I will miss you my friends
Let me move along for the road never ends
Vowing to live till the end of all time
All the way to the ends of the earth because I'm
Waiting for you to say you will be mine
Many long days, many long years
Many wrong plays, many wrong fears
I could be tossed in the arms of the sea
I could be caught between decks eternally
Waiting for you to ask what's keeping me

What would we do at the end of the day
When the hours are asleep and the time slips away
Children are all that the earth has to show
Children are all that the earth wants to know
Up here in the northland, up here in the snow

Up in the wilderness, land of our birth
Land of our toil, land of our worth
I could stay healthy and wealthy and wise
For I love the snow other snowbirds criticize
Tell that to a wife and you'll get a surprise

The skies of north america are covered in stars
Over factories and farms, over hamlets and bars
The breeze of north america is breathless at night
Out there in the distance some souls are in flight
Some soft-hearted lovers whose goals are in sight

Here in my on-again, off-again style
Here in my on-again, off-again smile
Here in my off-again, on-again grin
Here in my off-again, on-again skin
Waiting for you to say let us begin
",Waiting for You,1999
Gordon Lightfoot,"What can you do? You'll never win
Where will you go when night closes in?
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?
Where will it stop?

Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly
All we need is a friend I guess
With my midnight star to guide through
Clouds of loneliness

You knew someone but was it love?
So many years, push came to shove
You had a dream, so they had one too
You turned away, they were untrue

In our early days we were too willing
At the time we had yet to arrive
Many a man and a woman found
Trying to stay alive

Where will you go? What will you do
When your whole world ain't talking to you?
Maybe you think you will see the light
Baby, it's time you hope it's right

And I'm all dressed up to be somebody
All I need is a friendly face
With my midnight crowd to glide through
Clouds of empty space

Seems like every time we turn around
What we see could be anyone's guess
Many a man and a woman found in
Clouds of loneliness

",Clouds of Loneliness,2004
Gordon Lightfoot,"There's a town they call Orillia, It is there of which I sing.
It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching.
Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,
Coooochiching

Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-

In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.

-Chorus-

Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-

When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,
I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-",Couchiching,2004
Gordon Lightfoot,"Oft times, I recall how it was in days gone by
No tears at all, now you better not make me cry
Because you know darn well
I may ring your bell

Is there anybody home?
Is there anyone in there?
Who can tell me where I am?

Oft times, I recall when there wasn't no need to lie
So much was said but we never did say goodbye
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear

Is there anybody home, don't you know I'm all alone?
Can you tell me where I am?
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time

One day, time will tell when you're living in yesterday
Thinking of things to do, thinking of things to say
Thinking of things divine, find a bottom line

Is there anybody home?
Is there anyone in there?
Who can tell me where I am

Oft times I recall, I was thinking of ways to win
Ready to risk it, all until it wore thin
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear

Is there anybody home, don't you know, I'm all alone
Can you tell me where I am?
All I can do, is love you 'til the end of all time
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time

Look for me, they know me well
Travelers come and travelers go
Down around the Hotel No

If you choose the No Hotel
Be prepared to run pell mell
Be another burnt out shell
You checked in the No Hotel

Down around the No Hotel
Water there don’t flow so well
Problems come and problems go
Freezing shower, say hello

If you choose the No Hotel
And the bellhop never rings the bell
Why there’s another ne’er do well

There's caterers who cater not
And the waiters who don’t wait a lot
You’ve checked in the No Hotel

Living at the No Hotel
Just another ne’er do well
Seasons ebb and seasons flow
Down around the Hotel No

Snug in your No Hotel room
See the little critters fly
Above the bed sheets telling lies
You’ve checked in the No Hotel

Down around the No Hotel
Look for me, they know me well
Travelers come and travelers go

And if you choose the No Hotel
The bellhop never rings the bell

Gordon Lightfoot,"Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around
Leaving me low and leaving me down
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way

I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow

As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be
But at best I fail to see any happening
Some gotta lose and some gotta win
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way

Everywhere I go, there is no one I know
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow
You're leaving right now

",Sometimes I Wish,2004
Gordon Lightfoot,"If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost you can see

If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstore sells
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
Come the hero would be me
Heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just to hard to take

I walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two, a movie queen
To play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love let's be real

I never knew I feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back

You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feeling that you left

Gordon Lightfoot,"I'm sailing down the summer wind
I got whiskers on my chin
And I like the mood I'm in
As I while away the time of day
In the lee of Christian Island
                                      
Tall and strong she dips and reels
I call her Silver Heels
And she tells me how she feels
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling
But for one more day she would like to stay
In the lee of Christian Island
                                      
I'm sailing down the summer day
Where fish and seagulls play
I put my troubles all away
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup
With the whiskey of the highlands
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip
From the lee of Christian Island
                                      
Tall and strong she slips along
I sing for her a song
And she leans into the wind
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'

Gordon Lightfoot,"In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big seven o seven set to go
Well I'm stuck here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Now the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She'll be rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground
As cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way

Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way

Gordon Lorenz Singers,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,2006

Which no colleen may own.

No other can take it,
No one ever will.

Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

In the window at night,

And guided me right.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

O yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1996
Gordon MacRae,"How do you speak to an angel
I'm completely in the dark
When you know that you've just met an angel
Is there a proper remark

We were alone for a moment
Why was I lost in a cloud
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper
Or do you just say I love you out loud

We were alone for a moment
Why was I lost in a cloud
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper
Or do you just say I love you out loud",How Do You Speak to an Angel,1999
Gordon MacRae,"You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
 
You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
",You Were Meant for Me,1999
Gordon MacRae,"Younger than springtime are you,
Softer than starlight are you;
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me.
Gayer than laughter are you,
Sweeter than music are you;
Angel and lover, heaven and earth,
Are you to me.

And when your youth and joy invade my arms
And fill my heart, as now they do,
Younger than springtime am I,
Gayer than laughter am I,
Angel and lover, heaven and earth,
Am I with you.",Younger Than Springtime,1999
Gordon MacRae,"He: I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own,
She: Darling this place is a lover's oasis where lights where we chase is unknown,
He: Far from the cry of the city where flowers pretty caress the stream,
Both: Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in, don't let it abide in my dream.

He: Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two, and two for tea.
Just me for you, and you for me alone.
She: Nobody near us, to see and to hear us, no friends or relations
On weekend vacations, we won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear.

He: They will brake (?) and you'll awake, and start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see.
Both: We will raise a family, a boy for you and a girl for me,
Can't you see how happy we will be.",Tea for Two,2000
Gordon MacRae,"All my life I've waited for an angel
But no angel ever came along
Then one happy afternoon I met you
And my heart began to sing a song
Somehow, I mistook you for an angel
But now I'm glad that I was wrong

You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

The human little faults that you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do

So until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

The human little faults you do have,
Just make me love you more

Because you're such an angel
That's why I'm sure you'll do
So until the day that one comes along
I know just what I'll do

I'll string along with you",I'll String Along with You,2001
Gordon MacRae,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
or two
A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three. For

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel together
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together","My Darling, My Darling",2001
Gordon MacRae,"Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails
[alternate line: In my top hat and my white tie and my tails]

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight. ",Steppin' Out with My Baby,2001
Gordon MacRae,"The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you?

You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in His light
You never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go

There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do",It Is No Secret (What God Can Do),2001
