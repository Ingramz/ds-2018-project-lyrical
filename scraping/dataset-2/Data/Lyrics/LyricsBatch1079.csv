Tate,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1986
Tate,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun (And West of the Moon),1983
Tate Stevens,"Well it's late July and it's scorching hot
In the Piggly Wiggly parking lot.
No traffic light cause it got shot
Way back in '88
Tanned legs dangle from an old tailgate
Somebody yells, let's go to the lake
There's still a ?
In the back of my Chevrolet

It's long, it's red
It's a car with a bed
Come on, let's go
Let's take a ride in the El Camino

Well it's hard to keep it between the lines
Cause Mary Lou Langley is looking so fine
Bobby's throwin' bottles at speed limit signs
And missing 'em by a mile
Full moon shinin' on a Tennessee night
Everybody is singing , Dixieland Delight
Goin' 30 miles an hour but that's alright
We'll be there in a little while

It's long, it's red
It's a car with a bed
Come on, let's go
Let's take a ride in the El Camino
Aw, take a ride

We prowl in the Fishhead Sloo
And everybody puts on their birthday suits
Except for me and Mary Lou
We got better things to do

It's still long, it's red
It's a car with a bed
Come on, let's go
We're gonna take a ride in the El Camino
Come on and take a ride in the El Camino",El Camino,2013
Tate Stevens,"Got a zero-turn John Deere gassed up sittin' right there
Cup holder cold beer in case I get hot
Five gallon can of paint and a picket fence callin' my name
Old truck in the driveway sure needs a wash

Then you come walking
I can't help but stop and stare
You give me that look, you know that look
Like, ""Baby, come over here""
Just one kiss, maybe one more
Baby, next thing you know
We're sitting on a swing, doing our thing
While the sun disappears
It's no wonder I can't get nothin' done around here

All my friends come by, see that grass knee high
Bet they're all wonderin' why I let it get like that
I bet they think I'm lazy, oh, if they saw you baby
Smiling at me that way, maybe they'd understand

Then you come walking
I can't help but stop and stare
You give me that look, you know that look
Like, ""Baby, come over here""
Just one kiss, maybe one more
Baby, next thing you know
We're sitting on a swing, doing our thing
While the sun disappears
It's no wonder I can't get nothin' done around here

Oh, I love wasting my time like this
Never crossin' nothin' off my list

Then you come walking
I can't help but stop and stare
You give me that look, you know that look
Like, ""Baby, come over here""
Just one kiss, maybe one more
Baby, next thing you know
We're sitting on a swing, doing our thing
While the sun disappears
It's no wonder I can't get nothin' done around here
Can't get nothin' done around here
Oh no

I really should go paint that fence, baby
It feels good up here on this swing though",Can't Get Nothin' Done,2013
Tate Stevens,"There's a front row scarecrow peekin' through Hogan's crops
There's a Trans-Am cute thing taking off her t-tops
There's a whole lot of honeys and they make a sweet backdrop
To a sunset banjo tunin' up to rock

Hey baby, wanna make a little music
Pull out your twang and show me how you use it (Oh oh oh)
C'mon

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle (Oh oh oh)
Holler if you're with me

We're all free-fallin' in this field of country love
It's a head-bobbin' hand waving' sea of solo cups
Sweat drops rollin' off, mixin' in the moonshine mud
From all of the bumping and grinding, I just can't' get enough
Oh, can't you get enough?

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little

Tate Stevens,"Got grease on my hands, my name on my shirt 
Twelve-hour-days, ain’t afraid to work 
Who-oh-oh-oh-oh I got this 
Got dirt on my boots, mud on my truck 
Long chain in the back if you get stuck, I got this 

Whoa, ain’t no law gonna get to heavy 
Ain’t no boat down this old Chevy 
I can’t twist 
I can run the plane on the DA Dozer 
With the same hand I can pull you closer 
Girl if all your needs were one slow kiss, I got this 

I’ll punch a clock when a week is gone 
If you wanna have a little one on one 
Who-oh-oh-oh-oh I got this 
If you wanna go out on the edge of town 
Watch the sun go up or down, I got this

Tate Stevens,"Well I've been livin' on truck stop coffee, Slim Jims and vitamin C
It's a wonder that the devil ain't caught me
I guess he's tired of playin' hide-n-seek
I've been drivin' like I'm struck by lightin'
I think about you and I start to speed
I might as well be playin' with matches
In a truckload of gasoline

If it's the last thing I do
If it takes me from Tupelo to Timbuktu
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna dodge every roadblock, speed trap and county cop
To get my hands on you
If it's the last thing I do

A box of chicken and a day old biscuit
Ain't nothin' left but a few old bones
I wanna stop but I'm gonna risk it
Caffeine got me chewin' Styrofoam
Now girl, I'm callin' out of Kansas City
It's good to hear you on this old cellphone
Just had to tell you what I've been thinkin'
First thing I wanna do when I get home

Tate Stevens,"She was counting her change in the line
At the counter of the grocery store
Every penny, every nickel she could find
But she still comes up short
Just a single mom doing the best that she can,
When a stranger slips a twenty in the palm of her hand.
She turns around to thank him
But he's already disappeared out the door

Just because God doesn't part the sea
Pull you from the fire
Doesn't mean that He's not there
His fingerprints are everywhere

When the mountain that you're climbing seems so tall
And the battle that you're fighting makes you feel so all alone
It doesn't mean you're on your own
Cause when you need it most
The world is full of ordinary angels

He just got back from a second tour of duty six months ago
When he closes his eyes, he's still fighting
That fright right here at home
And when the nightmares come in the dead of the night
His little boy runs in and turns on the light
He says, Daddy don't you worry
As he reaches up to kiss him on tippy toes

Just because God doesn't part the sea
Pull you from the fire
Doesn't mean that He's not there
His fingerprints are everywhere

When the mountain that you're climbing seems so tall
And the battle that you're fighting makes you feel so all alone
It doesn't mean you're on your own

The world is full of ordinary angels

Tate Stevens,"It can make you cry, it can make you laugh
Give you feelings that you've never had
Make the worst of times just fade away
Help you find the words that you don't know how to say

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song
It can change everything
It can right every wrong, help you hold on
Even when all hope is gone

It can take you back to that first time
When you both looked in each others eyes
You say I do, then take her hand
Slowly start to sway for that first dance

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song
It can change everything
It can right every wrong, help you hold on
Even when all hope is gone
The power of a love song

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song

Tate Stevens,"Life's kinda like a runaway freight train,
It starts rollin' and it never comes back.
It'll catch you in the eye of a hurricane,
In a tin-roof shotgun shack.
It will go there, out of nowhere.
It can change on you just like that.
Just keep on going, you can't control it.
All you can do is give it all you have.

You gotta ride it out
You gotta finish strong
Grab it by the reins and just hang on
Dig your heels in, pull your hat down
When it starts to spin
You just ride it out.

It's those nights when everything goes wrong,
It's those days when nothing goes right.
When you're on a nine miles of bad road
And there ain't no end in sight.
We've all been there, baby I swear,
It's when you kick it in the 4-wheel drive.
It ain't the first time, it ain't the last time,
Go on and shake it off, that's just why

You gotta ride it out
You gotta finish strong
Grab it by the reins and just hang on
Dig your heels in, pull your hat down
When it starts to spin
You just ride it out
Ride it out
You gotta ride it out

You see it coming across a 40-acre cornfield
There ain't no doubt it's headed your way
You gotta go with it,
Just tuck and roll with it
Win or lose, comin' out of that case

You gotta ride it out
You gotta finish strong
Grab it by the reins and just hang on
Dig your heels in, pull your hat down
When it starts to spin
You just ride it out
Ride it out
You just ride it out

Tate Stevens,"Way back as far as I remember,
Well mama always worried about me
You see mama, she knew my taste in women,
She'd say, whatever you do boy, find you one that's sweet
Mama, I finally found one, I'd like you to meet

She's sweet like a Cadillac
Sweet like a stack of cold hard cash
Sweet like the diamond bling
Dangling down from her belly button ring
She's sweet like a handful of aces
Tattoos in secret places
Mama can't you see, she's sweet

No mama, she ain't into ironing
And she ain't one to scrub the house and clean
No mama, she couldn't boil a pot of water
So she won't be needin' grandma's recipes
But mama, don't you worry
She's taking real good care of me

She's sweet like a Cadillac
Sweet like a stack of cold hard cash
Sweet like the diamond bling
Dangling down from her belly button ring
She's sweet like a handful of aces
Tattoos in secret places
Mama can't you see, she's sweet
Oh yeah

She's sweet like a Cadillac
Sweet like a stack of cold hard cash
Sweet like the diamond bling
Dangling down from her belly button ring

Tate Stevens,"Were you born in those bluejeans baby?
That's the last thing a man should say

When I do I'm gonna treat her right
I'm gonna crawl under the covers
Tell her that I love her, wrap my arms around her tight
Yeah, when I get home at night
Gonna kiss her up and how, I tell you right now

Gotta split it, gotta fit it to a magnum,
Gotta fuck it, don't love it, I don't want none,

Fucked the bedspreads up, 'cause I banged on it 
Hit tha hoe from the back and she sang homie
These same ass words from the same song, the same song

I was on the lakefront trying to get some act right
Hoe was acting funny so I had to kick game
I said you be my queen, I be your king, and things will never change
Now I'm just sitting there, lookin at the beaver
Its Hairy like Barry and its bigger than Geneva
Something said stick my finger in it so I did
Then came the 2, the 3, the 4, the thumb and aww shit
I just don't believe it, how could she concieve it
My fist, my wrist bitch, you need to summer's eve it
Douche ya bush black, you smell like stepback
What the fuck is that (whoo!) tunacat
Put her out my Jag fast, tell that bitch you get no cash
Get your shit together shorty, clean your lil funky ass

[Verse 2 (Mannie Fresh)]
Six years ago, a friend of mine
Said its gon' rain before the sunshine,
Some gon' lead, some gon' follow,
Some gon' spit, some gon' swallow,
Now where you going ?, where you been ?
And what's your angle, and how you fit in,
So this time I made up my mind,
Fuck being broke, its time to shine,
Kiss my momma, tell my daddy I'm gone,
Baby boy on his way to make a song,
From a quarter to a dollar to a five to a ten
You are witnessing, 
The rise of a young black entrepreneur,
Spread my wings, I'm about to soar,
Two million, three million nigga I did it,
Two billion, three billion nigga lets get it,

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 3 (Baby & Mannie Fresh)]

[Baby]
See I'm a neighbourhood baller with the beamers and sprawlers,
The broads keep callin 'cause baby I'm ballin'
Hood rich shit with these ghettos and bricks,
Stunna back at it ma' with that brand new six,
Stunna got that caddy with the bubble eye lips,
Fully equipped whips to custom made shit,
Now everything is wet, and everything is slick,
and everything is paid, mannie mink pimp

[Mannie Fresh]
You scared, get the new escalade, 
The long motherfucker get the head done in suede,
Shining at its best, nigga wear your vest,
Southern ass nigga with his shirts and jeans fresh,
I like them starched heavy, big box chevy,
Head till' I'm dead from my ol' girl Debbie,
Don't try it, buy it, if its factory, amplify it,
Might go nitro, ignite it,

Standing by a tree with some kackhi dickies on in a white tee

And one more time you ought to realize

For being caught in those boys vicious games

Never again, my dear, in fact

I'm going to stop the blueness in you
Also confess what my heart wants me to

Tatiana,"Puede ser que un día
Nos volvamos a encontrar
Para hablar de aquello
Que al final, nos separo

Puede ser que alguna vez
Se vuelvan a juntar
Los pedazos de este amor
Que ahora, se rompió

Puede ser que entonces
No sea tarde, puede ser
Porque siempre
Se está a tiempo en el querer

No me digas que
Ya nunca me podrás amar
Porque te empeñas en negar
Que yo te puedo hacer feliz

¿Quién te puede amar?
Como te amo yo por vocación
¿Quién te puede amar?
Como te amo yo sin condición

Por eso creo
Que aunque me dejes
Que un día vamos a volver

Puede ser que el tiempo
Nos enseñe a bien amar
Sin promesas, sin un pleito
Sin pedir perdón

Que las leyes a seguir
Sean las del corazón
Puede ser que un día
Vuelva toda la pasión

Puede ser que entonces
No sea tarde, puede ser
Porque siempre se está
A tiempo en el querer

No me digas que ya nunca
Me podrás amar
Porque te empeñas en negar
¡Que yo te puedo hacer feliz!

¿Quién te puede amar?
Como te amo yo por vocación
¿Quién te puede amar?
Como te amo yo sin condición

Por eso creo
Que aunque me dejes
Que un día vamos a volver
¿Quién te puede amar?

Como te amo yo por vocación
¿Quién te puede amar?
Como te amo yo sin condición

Si estamos en el mismo barco
Porque es que sueltas el timón
Si soy el aire que respiras
Porque asesinas mi ilusión

Who I am, 
Do I fit in.
Make believein' is hard alone,
Out here on my own. 

We're always provin' who we are,
Always reachin'
For that risin' star
To guide me far
And shine me home,
Out here on my own.

When I'm down and feelin' blue,
I close my eyes so I can be with you.
Oh, baby be strong for me;
Baby belong to me.
Help me through.
Help me need you.

Until the morning sun appears
Making light 
Of all my fears,
I dry the tears
I've never shown,
Out here on my own.

But when I'm down and feelin' blue,
I close my eyes so I can be with you.
Oh, baby be strong for me;
Baby, belong to me.
Help me through.
Help me need you.

Le dicen en la escuela y le preguntan en su casa
Y hasta ahora lo supo de repente
Cuando vio pasar la lista y ella no estuvo presente

La de la mochila azul
La de ojitos dormilones
Le dejo gran inquietud

Y bajas calificaciones
Ni al recreo quiere salir
No se divierte con nada

No puede leer ni escribir
Le hace falta su mirada
(Animo primo, ¡échele!)

De recuerdo le quedan sus colores
Dos hojas de cuaderno
Dicen amor entre borrones

El quisiera mirarla en su pupitre
Porque si ella ya no vuelve
Su salón será muy triste

To see what I could see

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming Apart (Santa Claus Is Coming to Town),1997

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1998

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Let me hear myself, let me hear myself

I'm a small time hustler with big things on my mind
If it ain't about the money then you're wasting my time
Heated three-five-seven full of bullets so rise
Bulb three point five full of crystal and ice
You heard my old shit and said that's what you like
So I spit the gangsterism, you're a victim in prison
Started something, I'm promoting the violence
Motherfuckers in the game scared, they're calling out tyrants
We're just thugging and hollow points is reaching
H Gang ain't no joke, we'll slip one through your dome
These child proof killers give it up with a sign
When their hands come together and they disrespect the knife
They in trouble, ese we blast them on sight
The little homies ride, multiply and divide
Let's ride, till the figures get right
Ese Venom, Ese Rabbit put in work on the mic

We can murder by numbers, I spit it bomb
Twenty five riders in the street, dead wrong
Homicide and we ain't gotta tell them why
We don't fuck with the law, we let our enemies die
We can murder by numbers, you do the math
Me plus a glock equals blasting your ass
Homicide and anybody snitch, they die
Subtract motherfuckers off the map and get high

I'ma start deducting motherfuckers off this planet
Damnit when you hate it's not hard to understand it
So let's divide solid vatos from these rats
And hoodrats and as a matter of fact
Let's subtract enemigas by the thousands
And poison all these rats by the dozens
I learn mathematics by slanging, maintaining
Counting bullets, profits, gang banging, trigger happy ass vatos
So let's go do this, I count dead bodies when I go to sleep
My nightmares are full of corruption
Placaso Veneno, deadly are my fractions
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction
Multiply, subtract, divide
I'm always ready to ride, plus I'm nothing nice twice

Twenty five riders in the street, dead wrong

Subtract motherfuckers off the map and get high

Just for my fans that's out there mobbing
LA fucking Times, they're killing and robbing
Homie coughing 'cause the weed's too strong
You're a hostage in your home when the glass' too strong
The homie flipping, whether killing or sticking
And all that I know is fuck being a victim
Young Rabbit, that uncut I'm sniffing
Ese drive through the park might end up missing
Never listen, is what my pops be saying
But I listen for the chopper and their fucking raids
Shit is major, so ese what's your wager
Get the fuck back, skinny chain and pager
Moms tripping because it don't add up
In a fraction of a second I'll go all out
It's when you're on one, that Conejo's necessary
The cd on repeat till you die in your sleep

Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, you got wacked
Everybody knew the rules
Killing just got to be accepted
Hits just became a habit

Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, you got wacked

Check it out, that's right

I'm a small time hustler with big things on my mind
If it ain't about the money then you're wasting my time
Heated three-five-seven full of bullets so rise
Bulb three point five full of crystal and ice
You heard my old shit and said that's what you like
So I spit the gangsterism, you're a victim in prison
Started something, I'm promoting the violence
Motherfuckers in the game scared, they're calling out tyrants
We're just thugging and hollow points is reaching
H Gang ain't no joke, we'll slip one through your dome
These child proof killers give it up with a sign
When their hands come together and they disrespect the knife
They in trouble, ese we blast them on sight
The little homies ride, multiply and divide
Let's ride, till the figures get right
Ese Venom, Ese Rabbit put in work on the mic

We can murder by numbers, I spit it bomb
Twenty five riders in the street, dead wrong
Homicide and we ain't gotta tell them why
We don't fuck with the law, we let our enemies die
We can murder by numbers, you do the math
Me plus a glock equals blasting your ass
Homicide and anybody snitch, they die
Subtract motherfuckers off the map and get high

I'ma start deducting motherfuckers off this planet
Damnit when you hate it's not hard to understand it
So let's divide solid vatos from these rats
And hoodrats and as a matter of fact
Let's subtract enemigas by the thousands
And poison all these rats by the dozens
I learn mathematics by slanging, maintaining
Counting bullets, profits, gang banging, trigger happy ass vatos
So let's go do this, I count dead bodies when I go to sleep
My nightmares are full of corruption
Placaso Veneno, deadly are my fractions
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction
Multiply, subtract, divide
I'm always ready to ride, plus I'm nothing nice twice

We can murder by numbers, I spit it bomb
Twenty five riders in the street, dead wrong

Me plus a glock equals blasting your ass
Homicide and anybody snitch, they die
Subtract motherfuckers off the map and get high

Just for my fans that's out there mobbing
LA fucking Times, they're killing and robbing
Homie coughing 'cause the weed's too strong
You're a hostage in your home when the glass' too strong
The homie flipping, whether killing or sticking
And all that I know is fuck being a victim
Young Rabbit, that uncut I'm sniffing
Ese drive through the park might end up missing
Never listen, is what my pops be saying
But I listen for the chopper and their fucking raids
Shit is major, so ese what's your wager
Get the fuck back, skinny chain and pager
Moms tripping because it don't add up
In a fraction of a second I'll go all out
It's when you're on one, that Conejo's necessary
The cd on repeat till you die in your sleep

Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, you got wacked
Everybody knew the rules
Killing just got to be accepted
Hits just became a habit

All my life, I've been waiting for someone who'll love me for me. 

[Chorus: x4]
He knows me; he loves me for who I am, not what he sees. 

He treats me like a queen, 
Not by giving me (oh, no, no) material things. 
By respectin' me, 
And holdin' me, 
And comforting me, 
Whenever I'm in need. 
I can truly say I've been changed. 
My inner strength has been rearranged. 
When you see his face he'll be right next to me.

You are why I wear the smile upon my face.

There's a power in the gift of love when its love that you least expect,
And you crawl until the day you stand to stumble once again,
Walk until you lose yourself, desperate to be set,
And you run until you run away before you realize that all you really ever had to do was spread your precious wings and fly, fly, fly, fly.

Everything needs room to grow rising up to the warmth of the light.

Ansiosa pelo tato do carinho arrebatado do calor da tua mão

Taxi Gang,"Sitting in a railway station with my suitcase in my hand
Going back where I came from, I've had more than I can stand
Of watching men destroy my dreams 
They picked my brain till it was clean

When I was up they knocked me down
I ain't going to hand around, I'm going home
I'm going home, going home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game
But using people just ain't my thing
And I don't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm going home

Say that is so

Stay here awhile

You, you ain't a better thing
But if you got a big car take me for a ride

Folding my fingers through your hair
Taking my time to look on
Dreaming of white chocolate lotion
I gotta find a better place where I can be another face
And people look on

Take me to Sunset Park
We'll find a better day, somewhere that's far away
Find me at Sunset Park
Lay back and make believe, we can be anything
We're on our own

Out you flew and all you saw
Was someone standing with their dreams

I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you

Suddenly it?s changed
You opened up and find
Something deep inside that tells you
You were the fool to lend yourself

To such amusing games
Take yourself and make your name
And leave you there without your dreams
Run, run away

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance you'll see, run away

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to scold you and to say run
In the darkness

And now it?s come to pass
And now we're here at last
I know you sometimes think of me
I know a foolish child would scream

It?s hard to think and hold you tight
It?s hard to be unbending when there's
Everything you've stripped from me
So run, run away

'Cause in your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you, run on

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to hold you once again, run on

Close my eyes, make believe he's you 
I need to dance with a stranger 

Take my hurt away 
Before I'm over you 
Heard the city hummin' 
Grab my shoes and go downtown 
Won't need no invitation 
Just to hear the sweet, sweet sound 
And I don't want no man to ask me 
""Where you been all my lonely life"" 
Just want to move real slow 
And have somebody hold me tight 

[Chorus]

I hear the heart is lonely hunter 
And I believe it to be true 
But this heart is learning to forget 
I ever fell in love with you

Just break it down rebuild it up somehow

Hides in the shame

I liked the John Singer Sargents

Taylor Hicks,"I've been traveling all these years,
Just barely getting by.
The road can be your friend
Or the devil in disguise.

When the tough get going,
The muses visit me.
Yet in soft, low tones,
They always say to me,
Say to me,

""It ain't no groove thing,
It ain't no country twang,
It's a simple refrain;
It's a soul thang."" [2x]

Where the city street meets the county road,
Where the sun is nice and warm,
No matter how long I may roam,
This song still takes us home,
Takes us home.

Now we'll tell you about these times,
When the blues come out to play,
And jazz leaves her number...
It's funny, she always says:

""It ain't no groove thing,
It ain't no country twang,
It's a simple refrain;
It's a soul thang."" [2x]

Now I'll tell you about these times,
When the blues come out to play,
And jazz leaves her number...
It's funny, she always says:

""Well, the city lights fly by me,
As their eyes are getting heavy.
We're sending our love over telephone wire.
These days getting lonelier by the mile...by the mile.""

It ain't no groove thing,
It ain't no country twang,
It's a simple refrain;
It's a soul thang. [2x]

Yeah, ain't no country twang,

So far away from your southern home
Takin' your charms and dreams to the Golden State
Make your way, seal your fate

That's when you're gone away
Where no one will hear you cry
When you're late
For that west Texas sky

When you left home, I didn't think twice
Oh, I knew, you had to roam
I knew that life was getting you down
You always feel alone when there's no one around

But who gets cut when the knife is dull?
And who gets lost when the map is full
Nobody wins and nobody loses
Just a handful of sorrows
And too many excuses

You wanted to walk beside the ocean
Oh, and stand beside the sea
And now you can't wait until tomorrow
There's so much to do
And so much to see

But I can't see one anywhere

All the milk and honey

She keeps herself all over the news

The new inside edition is feeding all they can to her fans
She's got the paparazzi behind her Mazzarati

I said why, why, why does it have to be such a big deal
We try, try, try, Ive come to the conclusion
Were living an illusion,
Were better of just keeping it real
Were better of just keeping it real

About giving up the booty
She showed it all and nobody cared
And made her such a mess
When she didn't get the press

Taylor Hicks,"I look around this room
And feel the pool of tender years
Before we knew enough
To be afraid of all our fears

Baby there was no corner
We couldn't fight our way out of
And every thought of leaving
Left us leaning on this love
We had it all you know
Before you started letting go

If you can walk away tonight
Give it up for good
Throw it all away like we
swore we never wood
If you can tear down everything we built
Deny everything we felt
I guess there's a lot I misunderstood

If you can leave here tonight
Baby maybe you should

Baby I just keep on seeing
All that moonlight shining down
The way our love could light up
This little Alabama town

So I keep holding on to hope
Still finding reasons to believe
Cause all I ever got from you
Was always just enough for me
But if it's not for you
Do what you gotta do

If you can walk away tonight
Give it up for good
Throw it all away like we
swore we never wood
If you can tear down everything we built
Deny everything we felt

New found freedom making up for lost time
Dug a little deeper moved it on down the line
Must have been sleeping it's about time I opened my eyes.

When I walk I walk with confidence
I hold my head up high when I talk
I've got a positive sense of who I am inside
New found freedom gonna spread my wings and fly.

It's no secret where I've been before
Turned that corner standing at the front door
Starting down a new road leaving the other side
Gonna release it breaking away the ties that bind.

I hold my head up high when I talk
I've got a positive sense of who I am inside

And the earth shook that's all it took
To make a change in me it's a new way
A new day things ain't what they used to be.

The number on his back wore the captain of
The high school football team

Took us all the way to state
Got a scholarship to play down in Tennessee

He could catch he could throw he could run he
Could go like you've never seen

Nineteen
But on the day those twin towers came down
His whole world turned around
He told them all I can't play ball there's a war on now
He marched right in with a few good
Men and joined the marines

At nineteen

He's a boy next door
He might of carried your bags at the grocery store
Now he's somebody's son in a hole
With a gun in a foreign land
Trying to hold on to his American dream

At nineteen

There's a sniper out there in the dark
Somewhere and a soldier is down
Need someone who can duck and run and get him out somehow
What one good man will raise his hand
And take one for the team
How bout you nineteen?

Brought him home today with a big
Parade down on main street

Love was much so much sweeter
With you in my life
Now I know what my heart lacks

To once upon a lover of mine.

I should have never let her get inside my heart

Comes back a thousand times

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)

Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

Thought that we'd be the last to go

The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go

Tried hard to settle down

So many men no-one needs

Friends for life, trespassers get shot once
Survivors, shot twice

Don't take my kindness for weakness
Don't take my silence for ignorance
So if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life
There's two things you need to know
We don't retreat, we reload
Nah we don't retreat, we reload",Reload,2017
Taylor Sorensen,"Lazy summer afternoon
Screened-in porch and nothin' to do
I just kicked off
My tennis shoes

Slouchin' in a plastic chair
Rakin' my fingers through my hair
I close my eyes and I leave 'em there
And I yawn and sigh and slowly fade away

Deep enough to dream in brilliant
Colors I have never seen
Deep enough to join a billion
People for a wedding feast

Deep enough to reach out and touch
The face of the One who made me
And oh, the love I feel and oh, the peace
Do I ever have to wake up?

Awakened by a familiar sound
A clumsy fly is buzzin' around
He bumps the screen
And he tumbles down

He gathers about his wits and pride
And tries again for the hundredth time
'Cause freedom calls from the other side
And I smile and nod and slowly drift away

Deep enough to dream in brilliant
Colors I have never seen
Deep enough to join a billion
People for a wedding feast

Deep enough to reach out and touch
The face of the One who made me
And oh, the love I feel and oh, the peace
Do I ever have to wake up?

'Cause peace is pouring over my soul
See the lambs and the lions playin'
I join in and I drink the music
Holiness is the air I'm breathin'

My faithful heroes break the bread
And answer all of my questions
Not to mention what the streets are made of
My heart's held hostage by this love

Deep enough to dream in brilliant
Colors I have never seen
Deep enough to join a billion
People for a wedding feast

Deep enough to reach out and touch
The face of the One who made me
And oh, the love I feel and oh, the peace
Do I ever have to wake up?

Do I ever have to wake up?
Do I ever have to wake up?
Do I really have to wake up now?

Taylor Sorensen,"Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain. 
Want the fire back.

Another question in me
One for the powers that be
It's got me thrown and so
I Put on my poker face
And try to figure it out
This undeniable doubt
A common occurrence
Feeling so out of place

Guarded and cynical now
Can't help but wondering how
My heart evolved into a
Rock beating inside of me
So I reel, such a stoic ordeal
Where's that feeling that I don't feel?

[Chorus]
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
And like a child he would believe without a reason
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and
I've been searching for that missing person

Under a lavender moon
So many thoughts consume me
Who dimmed that glowing light
That once burned so bright in me
Is this a radical phase
A problematical age
That keeps me running
From all that I used to be

Is there a way to return
Is there a way to unlearn
That carnal knowledge
That's chipping away at my soul
I've been gone too long
Will I ever find my way home?

[Chorus]

There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
And like a child he would believe without a reason
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and
I've been searching for that missing person
He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow
He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow
It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately but
I've been searching for that missing person",Lamu,2005
Taylor Swift,"She said
""I was seven, and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights.""
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and fallin' in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up; you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined, like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM, ridin' in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came, and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I

And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky

In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road

Taylor Swift,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know

Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have

And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love

I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Sneaking out late tapping on your window,

'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,
Our song is the way you laugh,
The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have,
And when I got home, before I said amen,
Asking God if He could play it again.

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day,
Had gone all wrong, had been trampled on and lost and thrown away,
Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed,
I almost didn't notice all the roses,

Sneaking out late tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,
Our song is the way you laugh,
The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have,
And when I got home, before I said amen,

Running circles 'round this house
Tripping over memories
Trying to figure things out
It's been a few years and I miss you still
Get your picture on the window sill
Been thinking of ways, I got days to fill
I don't think I ever will

CHORUS
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on
Hold on

I've been cleaning up this mess
Found a metal box with some black and white photographs
A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes
Didn't we wish we were superstars?
Sign our names in the dust on your family car
We'd be waving to the crowd
You be the diva
And I'll play guitar

CHORUS
Hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on

Thinking that we'd say the same
But we didn't know that the world would change
Yeah it just keeps on spinning
And we just keep on holding on

Hold on to things can't explain
Hold on to dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it

What if happiness came in a cardboard box

Taylor Swift,"Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something I just fell into.
And it was overrated,
But just look what I created,
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
Before you ask me if I'm alright,
Think about what I,
Had to do, yeah

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see,
I got an ""I Heart ?""
Written on the back of my hand!

I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right.
But I can't believe you made me,
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Wait right by the phone every night.
And now you ask about you and I,
There's no you and I,
Remember what you put me through,
I had to

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see
I got an ""I Heart ?""
Written on the back of my hand!

And when you're home all alone at night,
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby.
I haven't thought about you and I,
There's no you and I, and I know
Someday you will

Wake up and smell the break up,
Realize that we won't make up,
It didn't go the way you planned.
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an ""I Heart ?""
Written on the back of my hand!

Written on the back of my hand!
An ""I Heart ?"", yeah.

Taylor Swift,"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground

Taylor Swift,"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

Was it worth it
Was she worth this

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see 
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I'll drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart

And I'll do anything to see it through

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change

These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall

Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

But if you look a little closer

Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

When I left I wanted you to chase after me

When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door

How could you not know

Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please, don't go.

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes; escape this town for a little while.
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet,""

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby just say ""Yes.'""

Oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading

I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think-""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

Taylor Swift,"I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run and I
had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and

I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.",The Best Day,2008

The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress

Til we run out of road in this one horse town

I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave

Taylor Swift,"You take a deep breath
And you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year
And you're gonna be here for the next four years
In this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say, ""you know I haven't seen you around, before""

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Feeling like there's nothing to figure out

Count to ten
Take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who they think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

And your first kiss makes your head spin around

But in your life you'll do things
Greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors",Fifteen,2008

And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Taylor Swift,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song",Our Song,2008

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been

Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)

It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we find a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I've got space to run and hide
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,

Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.

Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't

Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to a night when you said to me,
""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose""

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I'll be waiting for you
Wary, since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you say it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now

Thought you'd be here by now",If This Was a Movie,2010
Taylor Swift,"Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now,
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.",Ours,2010

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say, yay
You smile and say, ""How are you?""
And I'll say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you,
I love you, I love you, forever

Go save the world I'll be around

He's complicated, he's so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep browns eyes has me singin'
He's not as bad like this reputation
I can't hear one single word they said, no
You really got places to be and I'll be old then

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't take some other girl
I hope you don't forget about me
I'm far away but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you

She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho

Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know

Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ""run as fast as you can""

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you

Not where the story line ends

I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes

I don't know how to be something you missed

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again

I walk with my head down,

I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now

Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end",The Story of Us,2010
Taylor Swift,"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile

My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

When sparks fly oh baby smile

Taylor Swift,"I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

""Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,""
And they said, ""Speak now""

Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, ""Speak now""

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, ""Speak now""

I hear the preacher say,
""Speak now or forever hold your peace,""
There's a silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands,
All eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, ""Speak now""

And you say, ""Let's run away now,

Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,
So glad you were around when they said, ""Speak now""",Speak Now,2010
Taylor Swift,"I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier then ever.
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.

Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face

Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty am
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water

And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Taylor Swift,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Long Live [Live/2011],2011

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again, 
Got me feeling like a nothing

On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow 
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

You, with your switching sides 
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again 
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, 
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now

Talking over a football game

But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting 
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing 
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, can you believe it?
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye, 
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, I'll never leave you alone

You said, I remember how we felt, sitting by the water

Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now, 
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,

And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see

And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,

Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light ""Go""
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story’s got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you

And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream

Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you’re lucky
But you’re so confused,
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now

‘Cause now my name is up in lights,

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,

In red lipstick,

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,

When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly

Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away

That took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I I, I, I I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

Taylor Swift,"Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas
I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate
Just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me
Just met
But girl I got the remedy
Most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad
Too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
'Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile
Oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile
Oh dang
And I could care less that you famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
'Cause my first name Big
Last name Trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Taylor Swift,"You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I know now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in London today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York, be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back, be here.

Taylor Swift,"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I’ve loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never
Saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

And I never
Saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street",Red,2012
Taylor Swift,"I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here

I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back",Ronan,2012
Taylor Swift,"I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now

Taylor Swift,"I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, been everything so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that have molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again, on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there's nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t,
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t,
I almost do, I almost do

We made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
That in my dreams you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t,
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me",I Almost Do [Instrumental With Background Vocals],2013
Taylor Swift,"Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Taylor Swift,"I found myself at your door, just like all those times before
But I'm not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home, in your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine and everything feels better

Right before your eyes I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door, just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the time to let you in, just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes I'm aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore, ohh

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So over night, you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up, splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
They took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one

Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

Taylor Swift,"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and lonely we'll wait

We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, and different cities
And time is ticking a sweet summer race in you
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, break down, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, would you just try to listen
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get it back

A beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love affair

What a marvelous tune 
It was the best night 
Never would forget how we moved 
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing 
Like we're made of starlight 
Like we're made of starlight 

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
Picks me up play one night out the window we were 17 and crazy 
Running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party 
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince 

And I said oh my

Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me 
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things

Taylor Swift,"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I love the shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is great and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a worth while fight

Unless you play it good and right",State of Grace [Instrumental With Background Vocals],2013
Taylor Swift,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay, let's talk
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self indulgent takers who took all of their problem out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you, because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me, my fears, my hopes and dreams,
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay

As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll be smart to walk away
But you're quick sand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Forever going with the flow but you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the driving
And I will follow you follow you home
I follow you follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This day dream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin

New money, suit and tie

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""

That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah

So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah

When we decided (we decided) to move the furniture so we could dance

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying baby, I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees

You were looking at me
Oh!

Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics

Taylor Swift,"Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind

Oh darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
(In won-) In wonderland

I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)

Taylor Swift,"One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

She was convinced if she got up there
That she would be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly

She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, ""If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight""
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawlin' all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers

Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, ""If you work hard to get where you are

They only thought she entertain is where they are and where she is now

All her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud, ""Man that could be us""

And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too

You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away, whenever you need me
I'm in a G5
Come to the A side
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
You love it
I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say

I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too

I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team

He was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
And shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him

The light of freedom on my face

And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin', ""go, go, go!""

And a circus ain't a love story
And now we’re both sorry (we're both sorry)

Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys

Yo London stand up tall

Stress on the brain, complain too the fool
Stress on the brain complain too the max

Got this game in my hand, be cool
I'll stop a bull, make a boi relax
I'll take teeth for the money and jaks
We make money off album tracks
Come on I'll face it, lets all face facts
You may be some handsome chaps
What's that, but I'm invisible to all
Foolish fakish cats, Roll Deep will have some of that

Jus another brain complain to the max
Jus another brain complain to the low
Gotta get money, got get a lot of ho
No less than a G for the show

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

You know me baguettes and precious cuts
All in my rolie I don't shop a police cause I'm top
Of the line did you see how I made my Bentley drop to the
Ground, I'm a codeine dranker that's all I sip
And 2000 cars that's all I flip
If it ain't on chrome I can't sit in it
If it ain't a big body I can't fit in it
Down south we all about are money
Down south we get are piece made by johnny
Down south we like to swang on glass
If you want to sixteen you better bring my cash
I'm a millionaire for real and now you know 
My bank account say 10000

I'ma playa on 20's rider
U.P.T resider Bentley off the show room
First class driver everything I own gotta be paid out
I bought a mansion in Spain 
Next to bill gates house 
I love money large amounts
I never wrote a check the bank bounced
Whoadie I'm use to livin lavish 
I gotta rolie on my wrist about forty karats
I like to cruise so I bought me a yacht
I like baby's house so I bought the whole block
Whoadie can't you see I get my shine on

I don't know why baby
Hummers and Jags
'Cause we in Hummers and Jag

I bought a Jag off the show floe
Wit no miles paid it out I can't stand notes
Wrote a check for 70 grand my shit paid for
My money legal I ain't worried bout the feds brah
18 set for life dog I'm livin' gravy
Girl that's big enough for me and you ain't it baby
I got some shit around my wrist
That do nothing but sparkle 
My clothes and my mansion they madeamara
So much Ice in my pinky ring tellins horror
All my arms tattooed nigga C.M.R 
Moved mom's out the hood to washatona
She needed transportation so I bought a rover
She couldn't drive so I hired a mazda chauffer
Tomorrow night I'm goin to dinner wit your girl
Oprah,Oprah hoes see me in the club 
Be like that boy rich 
I don't take bathes in water Moet and Cris
I got some shit around my wrist 
That a blind the day
How many niggas you know sleepin' in Versace beds
Man that platinum 20 thousand dollars spreads
My nigga sold a trans am that was special made

[Chorus]

We gon' ball wit shunny pooh for the millennium
We 18 live in condominium

We ride on blades we ride on glass
And we got TV's inside our jags

We ballin outta control ya understand

I stay in cloverland that's all I know
And big head dollars that's all I hold

Big body on brauders that's all I know

From Redd's showroom ya heard me (off top)
We still balling, we still doing this shit ya heard me
We still in it (believe that) it's that flame shit

The wheels on my truck, go round and round
I'm sitting 24 inches, off of the ground
How that sound, mama said o what you'd like
Hold it rocking flights, red, white and blue stripes
But hold up, down South still on nonstop
Cause we been representing down here, for a while
With no solo album, I was still amazing
Stayed full of them trees, I was purple hazing
Look at me now, Redd ain't playing around
Two skinny, but my stacks keep weighing me down
They say balling is a habit no, I can't help it
Now I got more green, than a Boston Celtic
So I'm going all out, on a money route
Now I think these niggas, really know what I'm about
I don't know where you been, I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

See I'm a flosser, balling like you see it
Recognize me as a balla, legend in the streets
Best believe I did it all but, that will never stop me
From feeling like a flosser, cause I'm a balla

What y'all want to do, what y'all gotta say
You bump that Screw down here, okay
How you niggas acting, how you niggas roll
My album went platinum, my shit ain't gold

I'm still in the game, why'all catch my drift
I got that work cheap dog, peep my flip
When I hop out the truck, why'all catch my drift
The rolly's so icy, bitch get off my dick
We ride the finest cars, you know we stay stunting
Rims so big on the six, they sit funny
If it ain't broke don't fix it, blunt it and blist it
In a all blue something, with the plates unlisted
Like Nike, keeping you bitch niggas in check
Yeah whodi you know me, they boy is back
With two bricks, two chicks and two platinum Macks
I stay grinding, so you know I stay shining

What y'all want to do, what y'all gotta say
You bump that Screw down here, okay

My album went platinum, my shit ain't gold

See I'm like a value meal, my doe supersized
Copping a brand new Bentley, Coupe to ride
With mo' cake than a bakery, we got cream
Candy truck radio up, like Raheim
7-1-3 nigga, that's the name of my team
We still get full of that syrup, and gangsta lean
I still be ghetto fab, if I drove a yellow cab
Yung Redd enough said, my niggas got cash
Don't get it twisted up, my wrist lit up
You gotta show me something, for me to get up
Just call me a rough neck, but I cash enough checks
To put me in a Vet, and roll off with a set
The streets give me respect, for everything that I did
As a kid I always kept a strap, close to my ribs
But I don't know where you been, and I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling

Well, it was what I wanted now

I won't be blinded by the light

Quiero tenerte en mis brazos 
Poder salir y abrazarte y nunca más dejarte ir. 

Quiero encontrarte en mis sueños 
Que me levantes a besos 
Ningún lugar está lejos para encontrarnos los dos 
Déjame darte la mano 
Para tenerte a mi lado 
Mi niña yo te prometo que seré siempre tu amor 
No te vayas por favor 

Te mando flores que recojo en el camino 
Yo te las mando entre mis sueños 
Porque no puedo hablar contigo 
Y voy preparando diez mil palabras 
Pa' convencerte que a mi lado 
Todo será como soñamos.

Its like an opium dream 
Through your psyche it streams
It relieves and believes the pain that you fought in vain
Oh no....please don't
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Because your sleeping tonight 
Sleeping tonight
Safe in the arms of Morpheus
You've escaped through these means these delirious dreams 
Helped to shelter an sooth your soul
The regrettable roles 
The salvation they sold
Satisfied your desire to burn 
And now you've learned?
Oh no....please don't

Since Juliet and romeo
When will I learn, will I know how to say no?
Every wrong I turn into a love song
But I don't need to look I just need to see

You put me through pain when I put you through love
I told you my name when you told me a lie
It makes me ashamed, makes me wonder
Why I ever gave a damn about you

You put me through fire when I gave you a flame
Lover or liar, well, it's one and the same
It makes me ashamed, makes me wonder
Why I ever gave a damn about you

And now, after the world's biggest let down

It doesn't matter where we go
This is a dead-end street now don't you know
Last night we got into a big fight
But nobody was wrong and nobody was right

I put you through pain when you put me through love
You told me your name when I told you a lie
You should be ashamed, you should wonder

Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!

No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me

You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again

Is take these lies and make them true somehow

But it feels like the road to hell

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time

And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet

Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

Just blast off, sure shot

I'll scream, you shout,
Three strikes (and) you're out

If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper
Don't know what to do with you, oh do you know for you
But I think I like it, boy you've got that

Oh my, you got the bang to make a girl wanna act right
If I put my money on you every time, I know I'd get right
Checkin' my call log to see if I missed your call
When I was in the shower boy you got that act right

The way you love me I swear that it's a life changer
If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper
Don't know what to do with you, oh do you know for you
But I think I like it, boy you've got that

And you're the only one that I really wanna chill wit'
I know how you dude to make you feel missed
I take the front of ma, show you the realness
All nigga really needs is a lil' bit
From a hood chick lookin' straight off the runway
Won't bite her tongue, shorty'll say what she wan' say
From Sunday to Monday
She gon' ride whether it's in back of the Phantom or in back of the Hyundai
Not the fake baler throwin' cream in your face

My little Jack Russell know how to hustle
I stay with canaries on, platinum on every song
Hate it or love it, then respect how I does it

Cost a quarter million dollars for them like shiny rims
Understand me slim, this how the game begin
If he was me then he'd do the same to him
But L's the real deal, so tell me what you feel
Tell me one of your secrets, I'll keep my lips sealed

Pauvre, une couronne sur le cœur, faut qu'on m'enterre à Rabat
J'ai fait du chemin, on m'écoute de Kin' à Brazza'
Et si mes projets tombent à l'eau, j'ai l'flow à Mami Watta
Marocaine et Malienne, ma fille est renoi-harbi
J'aime les mélanges, j'ai mis du couscous dans son mafé
Fuck les chefs d'État corrompus, vous réalisez
Que l'argent du peuple finit dans les boutiques des Champs-Élysées
J'suis cramé comme une brochette de soya, eh ouais khoya
Si y'en a pour moi, y'en a pour toi, ya kolia
J'ai fait le tour de l'Afrique même pour des p'tites sommes
J'voulais rentrer dans vos cœurs, pas dans vos iPhones

A la foudjé bom mzé, j'ai pas besoin d'bronzer
J'ai le cœur qui part en débris vu les dégâts causés
Pour endormir les plus petits, y'a l'histoire de Mufasa
Pour que l'histoire ne s'efface pas, les tueries du Rwanda
Ils attendent de nous qu'on danse, qu'on connaisse tous la choré'
Mais j'resterai sur place, comme enchaîné à Gorée
De chez nous vient le soleil, et un peu tout c'qui brille
Pour mes harbis du Maghreb, de l'Égypte et d'la Libye
Ça fait du mal à voir, le berceau de l'humanité
Devient le tombeau de la cruauté
Certains d'mes frères des Comores meurent sur la route de Mayotte
Et tu sais qu'de de nos biens, certains se payent de gros yachts
La misère pousse à faire toutes sortes de travaux tragiques
Paix aux Musulmans et Chrétiens de Centrafrique
Moi je sais d'où je viens, c'est un luxe d'être en Clio
Vu qu'mon peuple est dans l'silence, je ferai de moi un griot

L’Afrique a la forme d'un gun, mais elle est pas venue armée
C'qui sépare le riche du pauvre, la Méditerranée
Chérie j'reviens d'loin, j'rappe pas pour la monnaie
Comme Hutus et Tutsis, on cherche encore l'harmonie
Les braconniers arrivent et les colombes se sauvent
L'espoir un sentiment inventé par un pauvre
Un tam-tam, une chanson, et l'village autour du griot
Moi j'suis resté authentique comme un pas d'dombolo
Assis au fond du bus, Rosa m'laisse sa place
Mon histoire écrite dans l'sable que les vagues effacent
J'baisse pas ma garde car la vie est barbare
J'ai des montagnes de soucis, essoufflé comme un Berbère
Même dans ma tour d'ivoire, j'aurai toujours la cote
J'tournerai en boucle dans vos cœurs si les radios me boycottent

J'rappe les descentes, les grosses perquises et les frères sans mis-per
Au ter-ter la neige dans l'nez des frères, j'rappe pour les sports d'hiver

Hé, hé, hé c'est Fouiny Baby pas oublier

J'rappe pour les bons vivants, j'rappe les fourgons cellulaires
J'rappe pour les gens conscients et ceux qui ont pas l'formulaire

Parfois j'suis doux dans mes raps, mais j'suis dur en affaire

Entre fautes et ratures j'essaye d'me relire
Entre trahisons et coup bas j'essaye encore de revenir

Tu es née pour briller
Fonce et fais mentir tous ces regards

N'hésite pas, crois en ton destin
Si les portes se ferment, il en reste plein
Tu es née pour briller, pour voir les foules crier
Depuis le départ ta musique parle même aux muets
De toutes les couleurs, tous tes mots sont des toiles
Si l'échec casse la boussole, tu peux suivre les étoiles
Ton talent laisse des traces, et tout le public a suivi
Fouiny Fouiny Babe, l'avenir s'appelle Sindy

Je poursuis mes rêves toujours plus loin
Je sais qu'les étoiles se trouvent au bout du chemin
Quand la nuit s'achève, qu'il ne me reste plus rien
Je me relève
Je crois en mon destin

En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
Je crois en mon destin

En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
Je crois en mon destin

Je poursuis mes rêves toujours plus loin
Je sais qu'les étoiles se trouvent au bout du chemin
Quand la nuit s'achève, qu'il ne me reste plus rien
Je me relève
Je crois en mon destin

En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin
Je crois en mon destin

En, en, en mon destin
En, en, en mon destin

Team BS,"C'est bon t'as ce qu'il faut?
OK, mais non, t'es sérieux Skalp' là?
C'était ma dernière prise?
Ça veut dire l'album il est fini là en fait?
Et mais, et, enregistre ce que j'vais dire là, continue s'te plaît c'est important.
Tout l'monde est là là, vous m'entendez?
OK, j'vais peut-être passer pour une pauvre fille en vous disant ça en fait,
Mais j'vous jure j'suis émue.
J'suis émue de ouf.
Fababy j'te vois s'te plaît arrête de rigoler, c'est pas cool.
J'parle avec mon cœur là.
C'est un truc de malade, 'fin
Pour vous le studio c'est, c'est normal, c'est, c'est votre quotidien.
Moi j'ai commencé dans ma chambre, toute seule, devant un ordinateur.
Et j'me nourrissais de mes rêves et là j'les vois se concrétiser 'fin
C'est un truc de ouf.
Je suis vraiment contente d'être avec vous sur ce projet,
J'suis tellement heureuse en fait que
Je vais rentrer à Royan avec des étoiles plein les yeux et
J'ai pas les mots en fait.
J'ai jamais vraiment cessé d'y croire et là j'vois qu'tout prend forme et
Merci, merci de toutes mes forces merci.
Merci Laouni, merci Sultan, merci Fab, merci.
J'ai mis tellement de cœur dans ces paroles
Et tellement d'moi dans ces chansons
Et j'espère vraiment que les gens qui écouteront cet album
L'écouteront avec autant de cœur et autant d'espoir qu'on a pu y placer.

Team BS,"Combien d'fois tes rêves, mourront en plein vol?
C'est la faute à pas d'chance, c'est la faute à pas d'chance
Combien de fois, tu mangeras le sol?
C'est la faute à pas d'chance, c'est la faute à pas d'chance

Et si tu croises des millions de sourires
Sur ta route, des fois, meilleur est l'avenir
Sans regret, sans peur, si l'amour peut guérir
Toutes ces plaies, toutes ces plaies

On m'a volé, j'ai riposté, j'ai fini écroué
Jusqu'au lycée, aucun diplôme pourtant j'étais dévoué
J't'en pas l'autre joue donc j'ai du mal qu'mon honneur soit bafoué
Ligne d'arrivée ou case départ, demande à Fabrice Eboué
La faute à pas d'chance si les dettes ont eu raison d'notre bonheur
La faute à pas d'chance si j'trouve d'l'amour que chez mes followers
La faute à pas d'chance, ce jour là, l'juge était d'mauvaise humeur
La faute à pas d'chance car l'espoir veut plus émettre de lueur
J'ai vu l'bonheur à l'horizon, j'suis bloqué par les Gris
Tu reformulais mon ressenti, j'suis bloqué par les cris
J'croque la vie à pleines dents, d'autres rêvent d'une poignée d'riz
On voit rouge, alors qu'à perte de vue, le ciel est gris

Et si tu croises des millions de sourires
Sur ta route, des fois, meilleur est l'avenir
Sans regret, sans peur, si l'amour peut guérir
Toutes ces plaies, toutes ces plaies

Han, toute la nuit au stud', les yeux, comme les reufs, sont cernés
J'ferai des heures sup', vendre des stups, finir enfermé
J'faisais d'la guitare car ma vie n'tenait pas qu'à un fil
Mon ventre faisait du bruit mais comment rester tranquille?
Petit, j'rêvais d'foutre le camp, quitter le rain-té
À trop effriter, suivre les grands et vouloir grimper
À trop prendre toutes ces mauvaises décisions, que Dieu me pardonne
Le bien, le mal, le mauvais, le bon, contradictions, slaloms

J'suis l'dernier d'la famille, éduqué par une mère seule
Enfermé dans une symphonie, j'ai besoin d'une clé d'sol
Drive-bys, balles perdues, c'est d'la faute à pas d'chance
Va pas plus vite que la musique, tu connais aucun pas d'danse
J'ai l'cœur nasé, et ça sans faire d'la soudure
Les boxeurs encaissent tous les coups mais pas les coups durs
Larmes rouillées, gorge nouée, poches trouées
Parents liés, sœurs soûlées, frères écroués
C'est d'la faute à pas d'chance si j'suis un petit insolent
La fin sera triste, rajoute des petits bruits d'violon
Bordé par la haine, éduqué par la violence
La chance éclaire l'Afrique, la misère ferme les volets

Et si tu croises des millions de sourires
Sur ta route, des fois, meilleur est l'avenir
Sans regret, sans peur, si l'amour peut guérir
Toutes ces plaies, toutes ces plaies

Combien d'fois tes rêves, mourront en plein vol?
C'est la faute à pas d'chance, c'est la faute à pas d'chance
Combien de fois, tu mangeras le sol?
C'est la faute à pas d'chance, c'est la faute à pas d'chance",Pas de chance,2014
Team BS,"Yeah, uh huh
Team BS, Skalpovich

Yeah, là d'où j'viens, on court après la monnaie
On essaie d'fuir la poisse, on y est tous abonné
T'façon la mort court après la vie
L'aurore court après la nuit
Les pleurs courent après les rires
J'cours après l'amour mais j'ai des points d'côté
On est beaucoup au départ, très peu à l'arrivée
On court après l'argent, souvent on triche
Au final, essoufflés (ouais) mais riches
Les anciens courent après l'temps
La concurrence, dans l'passé, court après l'franc
Nombreuses sont les falaises, on rêve de s'mettre à l'aise
Souvent, mauvaises sont les résolutions quand les principes se taisent

À chacun son rêve, son souffle d'espoir
À trop courir sans cesser d'y croire
Parfois j'aimerai prendre le temps
Prendre un peu le temps de voir et de vivre

À chacun son rêve, son souffle d'espoir
À trop courir sans cesser d'y croire

Bicraveur à la gare, j'cours après mon train d'vie
Descendant d'esclave, j'cours après un navire
Quand un pote s'fait fumer, là y a plus rien à dire
Quand ça parle du 9.3, t'es obligé d'me big up
J'cours après le temps, l'argent, Maman et ses rides
Rattraper mes prières, j'ai qu'Dieu comme idole
Quand un riche s'étouffe, la poche du pauvre rigole

Un rythme de vie bizarre, l'ingé' trouve pas l'BPM, you know
Lois, colère et pulsions, tonnerieux et frissons
Orange-Blanc-Vert, ces chiens, eux, connaissent ma puissance
J'ai perdu sommeil depuis qu'mes frères tombent
Prochain album, je l'appelle ""Soleil"" parce que j'vous fait de l'ombre

À chacun son rêve, son souffle d'espoir
À trop courir sans cesser d'y croire

À chacun son rêve, son souffle d'espoir
À trop courir sans cesser d'y croire
Parfois j'aimerai prendre le temps
Prendre un peu le temps de voir et de vivre

J'cours après les thunes, ralenti par de sales idées
J'cours après l'espoir, attraper la réalité
Je chante pas de ballades des poursuites m'ont animé
Moi j'rappe comme un malade, beaucoup veulent être contaminés
J'cours pas après le bus, j'cours pas après les meufs
La rue mène au parquet, pour ça qu'je veux des Jordan 9
J'atteins toujours mon but donc j'refais toujours surface
Souvent j'cours dans le vide, c'est mieux que d'faire du sur place
Même quand Dim est pro, j'essaye de toujours avoir l'sourire
Mes rageux seront des athlètes car ils peuvent toujours courir
Négro, j'suis trop loin, rendez-vous sur Pluton
J'suis un coureur du son, j'suis plus un coureur d'jupons
Même quand j'ai un manque à combler, j'essaye de faire le vide
J'accepte que cette vie soit trop moche, pour d'autres elle est horrible
Mes frères deviennent mangeurs de pierres par peur qu'on les lapide
Courir ou marcher, que Dieu nous guide

À chacun son rêve, son souffle d'espoir

 I don't know what 
 I'm to say I'll say it anyway 
 Today's another day to find you 
 Shying away 
 I'll be coming for your love, OK?

 Take on me, take me on 
 I'll be gone 
 In a day or two 
 So needless to say 
 I'm odds and ends 
 But that's me stumbling away 
 Slowly learning that life is OK 
 Say after me 
 It's no better to be safe than sorry

 Oh the things that you say 
 Is it live or 
 Just to play my worries away 
 You're all the things I've got to remember 
 You're shying away 
 I'll be coming for you anyway
