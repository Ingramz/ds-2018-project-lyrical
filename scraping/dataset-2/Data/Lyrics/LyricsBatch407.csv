James Morrison,"I've been moving in the wrong direction
I've been looking for something that's gone
Is there anybody who can hear me?
Is there anybody home?
Is there anybody home?

Tell me, where are all the happy people?
Where is the simple song?
Even the birds have lost their music

Tell me what is going on
Well, tell me what is going on

And we live our lives through magazines
And see our neighbors on TV
Hope someday that we can be like them
And ain't it sad that deep inside
We lost ourselves and don't know why
I look up to the sky when I'm alone
And I wonder is there's anybody home

Everybody's gonna say it's crazy
They say that it can't be done
When did we all stopped dreaming
About a world where everyone belongs
Where everyone belongs

The children lost their childhood
The mothers have lost their strength
The fathers have to keep on working

Till the day the money's spent
Oh, before they drop and die

Well, we turn our back on what is real
We don't even know how it feels
Really want to buy a bigger car
Baby ain't it true that deep in you
This feeling lives and lingers too
You look up to the sky when you're alone
And you wonder is there's anybody home

Tell me, tell me, tell me what is going on
We live our lives through magazines
We see our neighbors on TV
Hope someday we'll be like them
We lost ourselves and don't know why
I look up to the sky when I'm alone
And I wonder is there anybody home
Is there anybody home",Is Anybody Home? [*],2007
James Morrison,"How come you always wind up changing your direction?
How come you always end up dancing through the room?
How come you always never wanna use protection?
How come you're floating like a Helium balloon?

I can't keep up, you're moving too fast
I got to know, is this gonna last?
'Cause I can't tell whether you're up or you're down
This whole situation is spinning me 'round
Spinning me 'round, spinning me 'round

How come you always end up changing your intentions?
How come you always wind up blowing hot and cold?
One minute honest then you're full of false pretension
Head in the clouds but still you're desperate to control, to control

I just don't know what to believe
You build me and then you bring me down on my knees
You say you want me then you're up and you're gone
I got to know just where you're coming from
Coming from, where you're coming from

I got to know before it's over, one way or the other
If you're stringing me along

I can't keep up, you're moving too fast
I got to know, is this gonna last?
'Cause I can't tell whether you're up or you're down
This whole situation is spinning me 'round
Spinning me 'round, spinning me 'round

How come? How come?
How come you always wind up changing your direction?
",How Come,2007
James Morrison,"Oh life can be strange 
Good and bad in so many ways 
And in time you will find 
That things are not always what they seem 

Well I've got something to say 
But you might laugh, joke or run away 
cause I'm awkward and nervous 
Sometimes I don't say much at all 

But if the rain must fall 
If I lose it all 
If the world comes down and takes my soul 
If the sky turns black 
And there's no no way back 
It won't matter much to me 
If I had you 
All I need is your love 
That's all I need 
All I need is your love 

Oh well dreams can come true 
If you know inside you really want them to or you can sit you can wait 
You can leave your fate in someone elses hands 
Oh but I, I want you 
And nothing else can make me feel the way you do 
So I'm waiting, I'm wishing 
That it's me you'll be holding tonight and every night",If the Rain Must Fall,2007
James Morrison,"Let me hold you for the last time

So deep that I
I can't get out
And when you're lost, lost and alone
Yes you'd think it was a liars place
You'd come back for more
If you don't want me to leave
Then don't push me away
Rather blow out the lights you can watch it all fade
But I'm going nowhere

I'm gonna stay
When you just wanna fight
When you're closing you're eyes

I'm gonna stay

James Morrison,"I see lovers in the streets walking,
Without a care.
They're wearing out loud
Like there's something in the air
Oh, and I don't care

They're treading lightly
No they, don't sink in
There's no tracks to follow
They don't care where they going

And if they're lucky and they'll,
They'll get to see and if they're
Really really lucky they'll
Get to feel

And it kicks so hard,
It breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul.
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow.
It's better that you know,
That love is hard.

Love takes hostages,
Gives them pain.
Gives someone the power to
Hurt you again and again
Oh, but they don't care

And if they're lucky and they'll,
They'll get to see and if they're
Really really lucky they'll
They'll get to feel.
And if they're, they're truly blessed
And they're get to believe
And if you're dammed, you'll never
Let yourself be diseased.

And it kicks so hard,
It breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul.
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow.
It's better that you know,
That love is hard.

Kicks so hard,
It breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul.
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow.
It's better that we know

And it kicks so hard,
It breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul.
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow.
It's better that you know,
That love is hard.

But you said love taste so much better when its cruel
To you everything was just a game,

So much more than I should,
Yes I do.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah I'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Oh it hit me like a steal freight train,
When you left me,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

I was naive and wide eyed,
But you made me see,
That you don't get to taste the honey,
Without the sting of a bee,
No you don't.

Yes you stung me good,
Oh yeah you dug in deep,
But ill take, ill take it, ill take it
Till I'm down on my knees.

James Morrison,"I was the one, who would always jump in first
Didn't think twice to look behind
Got such a good feeling, just from playing in the dirt
Once, when I was little

We could build a rocket, fly to the moon
Leave Tuesday morning, and be back for noon
There wasn't nothing, nothing that we couldn't do
Once, when I was little
Once, when I was little

[Chorus]
Yeah I could dream more then
Yeah I believed more then
That the world could only get better
Yeah I was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life could only show me good times
Once, when I was little

There was a time when I trusted everyone
Yes I did
There was no place that I would not go oh no
Spend a day on the hillside next to the holly mo
Oh once, when I was little
Yea once, when I, I was little

[Chorus]

Used to feel so strong
Even when they tell me, tell me I was wrong
That I can't live in a magic world
Cause it's time for me to grow up
That I got to be like the rest of them
When I know there acting up oh

I could believe more then yes I could
I could pretend more then
That this life could only get better
I could believe more then yes I could
I could pretend more then

That this world could only show me good times
Once, when I was little
When I was little

So here comes the next one, the next in line
Stay as young you can, for the longest time
Cause those days flew by
Like a breeze just passing through
Once, when I was little",Once When I Was Little,2008
James Morrison,"I was young
And I was a victim
Of her killer smile
Her love was cheap
And it was great for a little while
I had to leave
But she wanted me stay
And she ripped up my shirt
And left the marks of her disdain

I couldn't take it no more
I couldn't spend another night alone
I couldn't take it no more

If this is where we ended up
Then I refuse to be so hard on myself this time
If everything I have is gone
Then what is wrong
In spending time with you

I'll keep you warm
You'll hold me tight
This might be our only night
I can't give up
No no no no, oh

I tried to reconcile
But it never made a difference
You could cut the atmosphere with a knife
It was so tense and cold
And every time I tried to get little closer to you
You got further and further away from me
Until you faded into the distance
Yes you did
There was nothing I could do

[Chorus]

I'll keep you warm
When you hold me tight
Cause this might be our only night
This might be the only night

Was it something that I said
Or didn't say this time

In all the shades of blue

If it's gonna be a rainy day

James Morrison,"I was so lost, didn't know what to do with myself,
I was my own worst enemy, I was lost and oh I needed help,
Then you came along, and saw what state I was in,
You picked me up, when I was down,
Showed me how to live again.

I say thank you, for pulling me through,
I'm a lucky man,
I didn't know what life was
But now I understand,

This is precious love, its precious love
No I can't let it go,
This is precious love, and its teaching me,
Everything I need to know,
This is precious love, oh its precious love
No I can't get enough,
Oh I'm down on my knees begging you please,
To gimme more of that stuff.

Love, love, love, love, love, precious love
Oh its love, love, love, love, love, precious love

Oh I got so distracted,
By people all around, whispering sweet nothings,
Filling my head with doubt,
So I gave up, it didn't take long for me to see
The one thing that I was missing, was standing in front of me.

Took you for granted, thought the grass,
As greener on the other side.
I was wrong, and its taken so long
For me to finally realize.

This is precious love, its precious love
No I can't let it go,
This is precious love, and its teaching me,

That my heart will always be true

That I want to be
Is right back home with you

I guess there's so much more
I have to run

I know which way to turn

Please don't give up on me tonight.

'cause I'm on my way, I chased the day.
And I'll keep running all night.
I just won't rest to catch my breath.
I will run every red light to get to you.
No, I will get to you.
No, I will get to you.

Hoping that that won't change your faith.

James Morrison,"I'm gonna make a change,
for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good,
gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways - ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)

(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!
(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know... that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You've got to move! Come on!
Come on!

Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!

Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling on your threads saying
Breaking yourself up

If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it

And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine

Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way

And everything, everything will be fine
Everything

Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?

Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing

Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything

Hold your own
And know your name
Go your own way

Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)

Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?

Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream

James Morrison,"Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone must change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes everything must change

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And butterflies do fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And music
And music
Makes me cry",Everything Must Change,2010
James Morrison,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

Tripping from Potsville to Starlight [""pot""sville]

I feel my flesh, all colors mesh

Oh my God your skin is soft
I love your face

How dare they try to end this beauty?
How dare they try to end this beauty?

To keep us under foot
They bury us in soot
Pretending it's a chore
To ship us off to war

In this dive
We rediscover sensation
In this dive
We rediscover sensation

Walking in space
We find the purpose of peace
The beauty of life
You can no longer hide

Our eyes are open
Our eyes are open
Our eyes are open

This world I painted black
Just needs some colour
I’m gonna live my life like the other
Person I should have been

I ain’t tapping out, no no no no
To this dark and twisted dream
That’s kept me living
I pray to my soul
To keep its fire burning
And when it does
I’m gonna let it shine

I’ll make the best of this life I’ve got left
Got no time for no regrets
Gonna show you just what I can be
The person I should have been

And it might take time, take time
'Cause this life has taken it right out of me
I wanna change my perspective of reality
Be a much better version of me
The person I should have been

I make the best of this life I’ve got left
Put my sincerity to the test
Wake up my senses finally
The water washes me clean

What shouldn’t have been has all been done
If I don’t get a grip
Then the world has won
Making me think that I’ll never be
The person I should have been

Who am I now?
A lonely man that’s fallen down
No I can’t change
The past that time has all burned out
But I know somewhere inside of me
Is the person I could have been

Make the best of this life I’ve got left
Got no time for no regrets
Gonna show you just what I can be

And I still feel the same
Hard to believe that a feeling this strong
Will every really change

I hold my head up steady
Both hands heavy
Oh just like the sky
It's so full of tears
Waiting to cry

Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
You never had nobody
Have you found someone
Who makes you feel
Like you're not alone
Yes you're going home
Going home

You're flying high like a Superman
Just like you've always dreamed of
Tell me now, are you finally free
From the troubles of life and love

I got your records playing
And I can hear you saying
This is where we belong
And I know I've got to carry on

Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
You never had nobody
Have you found someone
Who makes you feel
Like you're not alone
Yes you're going home

All this time watching you
There was nothing I could do
I know your heart was crossed
All those times that I tried
Light the light in your eyes
I couldn't see you were lost

It's like we've got our eyes closed
I don't know where it leads
I guess that we don't want to know

And we play these silly games
I don't wanna play no more
Yes I know to the sky
Holding my hand
Wipe the tears from your eyes

Yes we can try a little more
Don't lose hope until the love's gone
And all around the world
There is love until the hope's gone

And we're drowning in our tears
Even though we're standing still
I've sink you my fears
Thinking that we're all alone

And we try to fix it all
Like we're all magicians
It's OK to let it go
You only have to feel
What you already know

Yes we can try a little more
Don't lose hope until the love's gone
And all around the world
There is hope until the love's gone

Lalalalalalalala lalala

Love until the hope's gone

We are the army and we're burning into flames
We fight to hold on to but we blew it all the same

Yes we can try a little more
Don't lose hope until the love's gone
And all around the world
There is hope until the love's gone

James Morrison,"I haven’t felt this awake in years
Was too busy drying my tears
To feel the sun was shining on my skin
Locked up in my own cage
Filled up with a bitter rage
I couldn’t see the prison I was in

I walked across the line alone
To find a truth I’d never ever known
The truth was there all this time
The only one who couldn’t see was me

And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long
I gotta get a little light inside
And I’m here holding out for just one thing
And it’s your love, your love
It makes everything feel alright

I was slowly slowly dying, slowly dying
It’s like the first day I’m alive

Float through me like summer breeze
Put my twisted mind at ease
And all the troubles of the world just drift away
Jump out like a shooting star
I make a wish to be where you are
And underneath your glow is where I’ll stay
The only place I want to be
Is right here with you next to me

And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long
I gotta get a little light inside
And I’m here holding out for just one thing

James Morrison,"I was born with tears in my eyes
Like everybody else I know
Kicking and screaming
All I could see was a light in a world so cold

No-one to hold you
Feels so lonely
Left out on your own
But we were born with tears in our eyes
And that’s how we learned the strength to fight

It’s a beautiful life
Well, you won’t always see it that way
When you’re deep in a hole
With nowhere to go
And you can’t see it change

(It’s a beautiful life)
'Cause it’s just out of sight
It’s a beautiful life

You’re scared, got the fear every day
Sounds like everybody else I know
Takes a hole in the ground
Or the sky falling down
Before we can let it show

If you’re just like me
You’re trying to believe
That it’s all going to work out fine
We can live with the doubt
We’re trying to do without
Maybe we don’t have to fight

It’s a beautiful life
Well, you won’t always see it that way
When you’re deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you can’t see it change

(It’s a beautiful life)
'Cause it’s just out of sight
It’s a beautiful life

I tried so hard to keep hanging on
Well maybe you should just let it go
Let the hope in your heart break the fall

Sing with me

So we can see what we’ve become
There is nowhere to hide inside

Why won’t you say something now
Don’t leave me hanging
Cut me down
I miss the fire that was once in your eyes

James Morrison,"She pulled me in so easily
Right from the start
She played me like I was a melody
One bang on the drum and she funks me with a sweet kiss

She's touching me with lovers caress
No I can't fight it
She's got my soul
She's captured me

Holds me hostage when I hear that beat
I won't take these shackles off my feet
'Cause they're the only thing that make me feel free

And I'm barely alive

But keep on givin'
It's the only way to survive
But I can't help but shuffle my feet
Moving like a zombie, chasin' the beat

Locks me down like a repeat offender

James Morrison,"How can I find you
When you're always hiding from yourself
Playing hide and seek with me
Till it gets too dark
Too dark, inside your shell
Why do I even try
When you take me for granted?
I should know better by now
When you call I already hear that crashing sound
As it all falls down

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up, up, up
The only way is up, up

I watch your spirit break
As it shatters into a million pieces
Just like glass I see right through you
And your parade of excuses
Feels like groundhog day
You say the same things over and over
There's that look in your eye
And I hear that crashing sound
As it all falls down

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up, up, up
The only way is up, up

It's your love that's strong
It's the only thing that keeps me holding on
It's your heart that's weak
But it's not too weak to bring you back to me

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
When it all falls down

James Morrison,"The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, “My dear friends I have given my all. 
I'm sorry, it's all over now.”
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini 
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, 
We breathlessly await your masterful détente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat

We heard your repertoire 
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

James Morrison,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a Southern brand,
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
Who's colder than an Arctic storm,
Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah
She's got the right name, The vamp of Savannah
Any time a woman can take a great big pan
And start pouring water on a drownin' man
She's hard hearted Hannah

You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that

James O'Donnell,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",2002

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone,
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air,
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part,
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart.",In the Bleak Midwinter,2002

In a manger for His bed

James Otto,"If I hadn't dropped the ball, I would've took it all the way
Homecoming '89 with ten seconds left to play
We were driving toward the goal line, they were screaming in the stands
I had the chance to be a hero, but it slipped right through my hands
There would've been a big pep rally, they would've hung my jersey on the wall
If I hadn't dropped the ball

Me and Cindy Miller were supposed to meet after the game
I waited by the bleachers, but she never came
I found her note on my windshield underneath the wiper blade
With goodbye bleeding through it in the cold October rain
We probably would've gotten married
And those recruiters in from ?Bama would've called
If I hadn't dropped the ball

My life would've been so different if in that instant
Things had gone the way I planned
But the fact is that they didn't and the hand I wound up getting
Is something that I'll never understand

I ran away that summer, took a job out on the coast
That's where I met your mama and the rest I guess you know
If I had the chance to go back and score that last touchdown
Well, son, I wouldn't do it ?cause I wouldn't be here now
I wouldn't be your hero, I wouldn't be around to catch you when you fall
If I hadn't dropped the ball

My life would've been so different if in that instant
Things had gone the way I planned
But the fact is that they didn't and the hand I wound up getting

James Otto,"I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Early in the mornin', I'm up and I'm out
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin' that mic so viciously
Deliciously, not maliciously

When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bass line drops

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction

The last of the Brohicans is speakin'
The one that you turn to each and every weekend
Risin', peakin' while the bump is beatin'
Don't turn back, no retreatin'

You can see my vision, you can feel my force
Time to hit the trail, boy, the mic is my horse
I tantalize and tickle your tympanic with my English
Smile as you listen to the ruckus

As I bring this mic, can't get no satisfaction

I'm comin' with the best and fresh from out west
Bus driver takin' you to school to pass the test
See, I'm lyrically hypnotic, at times even psychotic
Neurotic, bionic and it may leave you catatonic

James Otto,"I got a blonde bombshell in my black Corvette
Burnin' down the rubber like a hot cigarette

Like a Tarantino movie runnin' through my head
Ain't gonna sleep again until I'm dead, cause

I'm gonna roll like a river anywhere that I choose

Keep the party pumpin' everywhere that I go
Everybody's rockin' when they come to the Otto show
I don't need anybody tellin' me what to do
I've come a long, long way with this bad attitude
Wore a hole through the sole of my alligator boots

And I don't mind usually
I'm an easy-goin', back-slappin' son of a gun
But she just left me
And that's just left me undone
So you don't want to push your luck boys, not tonight
Just don't bring up her name one more time

If you think I'm in the mood to pick a fight
You're damn right

She's gone and I admit I was wrong
But I can't quit
Thinkin' about how good our love used to be
And the whiskey numbs the pain
But in the morning when I wake
I'll be hungover hangin' on to a memory
And I'll order one more round
Lose the Coke and keep the Crown
And just drown my misery
And I'll blind myself with liquor and neon lights
Alone and stoned out of my mind

If you think I'm flyin' high as a kite
You're damn right

Now I'm just tryin' to make it through
But gettin' over you is a long, long road

Well I woke one day to a screen door slam
Found a good-bye note on our nightstand
Next to a coffee cup and a wedding band
Since then I've been a sunset man

I draw the curtains down

There's a girl comin' on real strong

Where God sends his mercy rainin' down
In the heart of Memphis
Where angels hang around

All the deals I've made with God
The conversations that we've had
Tryin' to accept things I could not understand
I wanna walk her down the aisle
While those church bells ring
See her get the chance
To live all her dreams

In a pine box covered in red, white, and blue
He was one of the brave and the proud and the few

I stood there in silence trying hard not to cry
As the preacher he quoted lines written in red
And he folded his bible in a broken voice he said

There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus

It seems like the news loves to run em' both down
Whenever we need em' there always around 
So don't hand me a parties political views
There's left side and right side and then there's the truth

There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces

One fights for my life one fights for my soul

Heats my heater, chops my meat; 
My man is such a handy man!

My man is such a handy man! 
He flaps my flapjacks, cleans off the table, He feeds the horses in my stable; My man is such a handy man! 
He's God's gift! 
Sometimes he's up long before dawn, 
Busy trimming the rough edges off my lawn; 
Oooh, you can't get away from it! He's such a handy man! 
Never has a single thing to say, 
While he's working hard;

You could speak about it, be a prophet or just be a product

I told him find somebody outside the church who was innocent
They only throw stones at trees that bear fruits
So don't be shocked when the mob attempts to throw stones at you

And when I stop dreaming, failure, we gon' break up

How I wish that I could see my little darling

I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

   She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
   And said that she'd be waiting there for me

   Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty

Just a big stampede when the Warragul calls
Times a'menacing just gnashes and mauls
Where'm I gonna buy it where'm I gonna buy it
Gotta give a dog a bone

With river mist & birth right

This could make such a right
Such a wrong

In a little black hole
Of all the things to be

The dream time
Oh I walking in the sun

Land of black fatigue
You say we braved the ocean
We crossed ten thousand leagues
You all stung the lashes
Of a hundred Captain Queegues
Not flying away flying away
Cut the name across your backbone
Stretch the skin across the drum
Set 'em up in some old island
Today 'till kingdom come

And you're fixing up your silver lining
You took a little black car
And drove it all the way

It's so confiding
And we could talk about tomorrow

Go under
I know natures calling
Summon her

Go have your day in the sun
Go have your day in the sun
I know your reasons boy
Go have your day in the sun

Does the light illuminate you
Or is it blinding
Well you should go and celebrate
The best time you ever had
Could be a corduroy road
Along the path you're finding
And all your battles will be happy
'Though some of them songs are sad

I hear strangers calling
Don't go under
I hear strangers calling
Run for cover

God's holding you tight
God's leaving the light on overnight
God's walking away

God's leaving the light on

Go have your day in the sun

The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been

Only to say lo and behold
Deep in the night, down in my dreams
Glorious sight this soul has seen

There's a well on the hill
You just can't kill for Jesus
There's a well on the hill, let it be
Don't build no heathen temples
Where the Lord has done laid his hand, now
There's a well on the hill, let it be

Everyone's talking 'bout the gospel story
Some shall sink and some shall rise
Everyone's talking 'bout the train to glory
Long, long time till it gets here to you, baby

And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left, the weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself, Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night when everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne, she was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye
I said, that I come from Dixie land, Suzanne, don't you break down and cry

And hold on to me golden days, slipping away
Sunshine on my wall to keep my mind on the things I'm saying
Footsteps in the hall to tell me I've been this way before, nevermore
Let it rain, sweet Mary Jane, let it wash your love down all around me
Come inside and put it down, let it rain

I've been trying hard to find a way to let you know
That we can make it shine most all the time
This time round I'm searching down to where I used to go
And it's been on my mind to make it shine

You can say I wanna be free, I can say someday I will be

You can say I wanna be free, I can say someday I will be

When I catch a common cold, wanna hear a saxophone
When I let the good times roll, baby, slide me a bass trombone
Walk me down old Funky Street
Lord knows I feel good enough to eat now
Hold my soul. Now, I'm sure enough fond of my rock 'n roll

When I go to sleep at night, wanna hear a slide guitar
When I'm feeling loose and right, go riding in my automobile
Boney Maroney and Peggy Sue, got the rocking pneumonia, got the boogy-woogy flu, hey
Hold my soul, said I'm sure enough fond of my rock 'n roll, good God

James Taylor,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James",Sweet Baby James,1971

I should say, my baby knows

When I'm in need of a little bit of consultation, used to call on my Uncle John.
Took a trip down to West Virginia, found him dead and gone.
And as some sort of silly little consolation, they gave me a ticket back.

I spied a young couple, they were making their way.
One was a maiden so bright and so fair and the other was a soldier and a brave volunteer.

Good morning, good morning, good morning said he,
And where are you going my pretty lady?
I'm going out a-walking on the banks of the sea
Just to see the water's glide and hear the nightingale sing.

Now they had not been standing but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played made the valleys all ring,
Oh hark, cried the maiden, hear the nightingale sing.

Oh maiden, fair maiden, 'tis time to give o'er.
Oh no, kind soldier, please play one tune more
For I'd rather hear your fiddle at the touch of one string
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing.

Oh soldier, kind soldier, will you marry me? Oh no, pretty maiden, that never shall be.
I've a wife down in London and children twice three,
Two wives and the army's too many for me.

Well, I'll go back to London and I'll stay there for a year,
It's often that I'll think of you, my little dear.
And if ever I return it will be in the spring

Round and round and round.

For this feeling in my bones.
That this is all a make-believe

And there ain't nothing up my sleeve.

But I'm a shrinking man, I'm sinking man,

Straddled that Greyhound and rode it into Raleigh and on across Caroline.

Had some motor trouble that turned into a struggle half way across Alabam.
That hound broke and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.
So right away I bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi clean,
And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham smoking into New Orleans.

There's an uncle there who cares a little about me and he won't let the poor boy down.
Sure as you're born, he bought me a silk suit, put some luggage in my hand.
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land.
Working on a T-Bone steak, a la carte, flying over to the Golden State.
When the pilot told us that in thirteen minutes he would have us at the terminal gate.
Swing down chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal dome.

Sailing for the new horizon.
May this day show me an ocean, 
I ought to be on my way.

Ought to be on my way right now.
Stepping on the boat 
With a lump in my throat, 
On my way right now.

I got a letter from a dear friend of mine, 
The story of a spiritual awakening.
She spoke of her love returning in kind, 
She let me know that she'd be waiting.
And I should be on my way by now.
Walking across the floor, 
Reaching for the door, on my way by now.

But here I sit, 
Country fool that I am, 
My elbow on my knee 
And my chin in my hand.
My mind in the gutter 
And my eye on the street, 
Holed up in a cave of concrete.
And I ought to be on my way right now.
Packing my things 
While the telephone rings, 
On my way right now.

I miss my lovely mother 
And I love my lonely father.
I know I owe my brothers one thing 
And another, I hear my sister singing.
And I ought to be on my way right now.
Moving across the land 
With my heart in my hand, 
On my way by now,
Ought to be on my way by now.

Oh, end this day, 
Set me in motion. 
Ought to be on my way.

Out of the west 
Of Lambert's Cove, 
There's a sail out in the sun.
And I'm on board 
Though very small, 
I've come home to stop yearning.
Burn off the haze 
Around the shore, 
Turn off the crazy way I feel.
I'll stay away from you no more, 
I've come home to stop yearning.",Terra Nova,1977

James Taylor,"Long ago a young man sits and plays his waiting game
But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end?
Why is this song I sing so sad?

What to my surprise,
When we got there she hit me 
With the news right between the eyes

They'd play some other dance,
But we sat there for an hour and a half 
And we never got a chance
Cause every song they played 
Was the cha, cha, cha.

I told her not to worry, 
There's still one thing we can do,
Let me take you by your hand tonight, 
I want to teach this dance to you.
I taught my baby how to cha, cha, cha.

We kept on dancing for an hour or two, 
What do you think I'd see?
We hadn't practiced for a time or two around, 
She was doing it better than me.
You know my baby loves to cha, cha, cha.

And it ran, run for your life, take to your heels.

As if you were the chosen nation.

And dangerous invasion, Gaia, Gaia, Gaia.

So we left that town in a single file.
Up and up and up, mile after mile after mile.

Sat down on my haunches and I looked back 
Down over the mountain,

James Taylor,"I am Jeremiah Dixon
I am a Geordie boy
A glass of wine with you, sir
And the ladies I'll enjoy
All Durham and Northumberland
Is measured up by my own hand
It was my fate from birth
To make my mark upon the earth

He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
A Mason-Dixon Line

Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun
A new morning has begun
Another day will make it clear
Why your stars should guide us here

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line

The women folk would hide, they'd hide.
When Liberty Valance walked around, 
The men would step aside
Because the point of a gun 
Was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, 
He was mighty good.

From out of the east a stranger came, 
A law book in his hand.
A man, the kind of man the west would need 
To ease a troubled land.
Because the point of a gun 
Was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, 
He was mighty good.

Many a man would face his gun 
And many a man would fall.
The man who shot Liberty Valance, 
He shot Liberty Valance, 
He was the bravest of them all.

Now the love of a woman can make a man 
Stay on when he should go, stay on.
Just trying to build a peaceful life 
Where love is free to go.
But the point of a gun 
Was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, 
He was mighty good.

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return 
That fateful night, that night.
When nothing she said could keep her man 
From going out to fight.
But the point of a gun 
Was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast,

Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

With dark and heavy hair.

This Savior whom we kneel beside.

With skin of yellow hue.

Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray.

And, ah! they love Him, too!

Come worship now the infant King.

The world was different, oh yes it was
You settled down and you built a town and made it live
And you watched it grow
It was your town

Time goes by, time brings changes, you change, too
Nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
Never see it coming, the world caves in on you
On your town
Nothing you can do

But it's our town
Love it anyway

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston

With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky

Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating

They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him

Until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky's would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom
Like a stone

There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
They will lean that way forever

The world was different, oh yes it was
You settled down and you built a town and made it live
And you watched it grow
It was your town

Time goes by, time brings changes, you change, too
Nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
Never see it coming, the world caves in on you
On your town
Nothing you can do

It's hard to find a reason left to stay
But it's our town
Love it anyway
Come what may, it's our town",Our Town [Original Version],2008

And one of them is always night
Hey, if you can take care of
Business in the sunshine, baby
I guess you're gonna be alright
But don't come looking for string bean
To lend you a hand
Because my eyes they can't stand the light

No, I'm a night owl, honey
Sleep all, sleep all day long
I said sleep all day long
I'm a night owl, honey",Night Owl,1968
James Taylor,"What good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry

It looks like another fall
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all
When you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man

It does you no good to pretend child
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose again, my friend
Call on your rainy day man

Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows
He don't need good times
Grey days rolling
Then you'll see him
Empty feeling
Now you need him

All those noble thoughts they just don't belong
You can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just look up your rainy day man

Now simple pleasures they all evade you
Store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
Ask again
Go on and pray for rain

It looks like another fall
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all
When you're feeling kind of cold and small

James Taylor,"There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
If I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
If I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
Yes and I feel fine",Something in the Way She Moves,1968
James Taylor,"Sounds of laughter, here comes sunshine, smiling faces all around.
They possess you, bless you, sunshine, now you can never let them down, I say sunshine.

Sunshine, sunshine, is that a cloud across your smile or did you dream again last night?
It's best you rest inside a while as blue doesn't seem to suit you right.

Things ain't what they used to be, pain and rain and misery.
Illness in the family and sunshine means a lot to me, I say sunshine.

But could it be Sunshine is drifting with midnight and lonely when everyone's gone?
Blue crystal spirits and gardens in moonlight
Leave weak alone and bleak all quiet and grey by dawn.

Sunshine, sunshine rising to late to chase the cold and failing to change the frost to dew.
She's trading her mood of yellow gold for frost bitten shades of silver-blue.

Friends and lovers past and gone and no one waiting further on,
I'm running short of things to be and sunshine means quiet a lot to me, I say sunshine.
Sunshine, sunshine...",Sunshine Sunshine,1968
James Taylor,"Morning, sing me a song, 
Afternoon, bring it along, 
Nighttime, show me a friend,
Say it again, 
Send a good dream my way.

Wednesday, feeling just fine, 
I got to say time on my hands. 
Friday, look at them run,
Show me some fun, 
Taking the sunshine in.

God knows you've got to give yourself 
Time to think these days,
Lord knows you've got to take enough, 
Time to look both ways, 
The pieces fly by so quickly now.

Laura, look at you walk, 
I swear you've got eyes in my head.
I'd like to follow you down, 
Show you around, borrow the crown you wear.

Bacon, lie on the plate, 
Two black-eyed peas wait on the side.
Gravy, chicken and rice, isn't it nice? 
Tell me the price of the food.

What happens when the answers they give you aren't good enough?
What happens when it rains for eight days on your week off?
You know you can't buy tomorrow, no, 
It's all a matter of opening up your eyes.
And looking around cause it's all there, 
It's all there, I said taking the sunshine in.",Taking It In,1968

Susanne the plans we made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days and I thought they'd never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again

You've just got to see me through another day

It'll turn your head around

I've seen sunny days and I thought they'd never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you, somehow one more time again, yeah

Thought I'd see you one more time again

I'm over that line today,

I guess I'm just a lucky guy 
And I'm prepared to tell you why.
It's strictly on account

I'm the fellow that she loves the most, 
The main reason why she left the coast.
She's my little girlzina, 
That much hotter that a jalapeno.
Tender like a night in June, 
Sweeter than a honeymoon,
Brighter than a silver spoon, 
Just as crazy as a loon.

Softer than a lullaby, 
Deeper than the midnight sky, 
Soulful as a baby's cry, 
My sweet potato pie.

I used to see her around the neighborhood, 
I wonder how she grew up so good.
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad 
And I never was ready to make him mad.
I'm glad I had to wait awhile, 
A little bit too juvenile.
I needed to refine my style, a silk suit 
And a crocodile smile.

James Taylor,"Off the coast of Africa, 
Bound for South America, 
A world away from here
Is a ship that sails the sea, 
Is a man who's just like me 
And I wish that I was there.

I'm a lonely lighthouse, 
Not a ship out in the night. 
I'm watching the sea.
She's come halfway round the world 
To see the light and to stay away from me.
There is a shipwreck lying at my feet, 
Some weary refugee from the rolling deep.
Ah, could you lose it all and fall for me?

Couldn't we shine? 
I'm rolling all my golden moments into one.
Like to shine like the sun 
For one more summer day.
Like to shine like a lighthouse 
For one last summer night,
Flashing on, flashing, fading away.

Well if you feel lost and lonely 
And don't know where to go
And you hear this song on the radio,
Or even if you're feeling healthy 
And strong, you might like to sing along.
But just because I might be standing here, 
That don't mean I won't be wrong this time.
You could follow me and lose your mind.

James Taylor,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Made of visions to explore

In the shelter of it's arm

That would keep the strongest sunlight
And reflect the brightest stone

There's nothing to mention, and nothing has changed
Still I'd rather be working at something, than praying for the rain
So I wander on, till someone else is saved

I moved to the coast, under a mountain
Swam in the ocean, slept on my own
At dawn I would watch the sun cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all the things my mother wrote

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope

Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Am I an honest man and true
Have I been good to you at all
Oh I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and, worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own

So we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust

James Vincent McMorrow,"In the canyon I was started young
In the ocean, in the valley run
There was hope that time would disappear
in the smoke and when the valley clears

And I think about the cold air
I've been thinking about cold air

And I was (I was) in the dark
I was (I was) in the dark, I was

In imaginary destiny
reached the palms and stretched around the skin
Every breath that echoes endlessly
every point to ever let it leave

Still I'm thinking of the cold air
always thinking of the cold air

And I was (I was) in the dark
I was (I was) in the dark, I was

Tripping the call, distance is you
Lifting it out, we kept it with odds
Thinking the motion that been hurt
Sitting in my fortress still I'm in the dark
Spilling in to fallness of it all

And I've been thinking bout the cold air
always thinking of the cold air

And I was in the dark
I was in the dark, I was",All Points,2013
James Vincent McMorrow,"Speak until the dust
Settles in the same specific place
Light refused to go
Drink it from a cast and iron plate
Instead of cold milk
Was offered unripe
Instead of silence
Considered craven

Nothing made it seem
Hidden where the aging soil was pure
Pressed against the crease
Mountains become fragrant at the source
How can you stand this
Exotic angle
I read it somewhere
That they would lie still

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

Unrelied I was called
Missing teeth out of favour
Nickel beach it was all
Gathering by the sundial

I woke hard
I woke heavy
For the half way stop
Five whole hours in
When I woke hard
I woke heavy with the live or parts

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

Show no sense of hope, staring honestly

I wanna go south of the river
Glacier slow in the heart of the winter
I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter

And this we'll celebrate, this we'll celebrate
There and on the stage, this is a mistake
Damn me off too long, down the earth and moon
Damn the clawing kneeling, rustling into change
In a moment I was caught, calling by a storm
In the moment of a hot

I wanna go south of the river
Glacier slow in the heart of the winter
I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter

I'm not in a glove called how

Few became, few became as glory as along
Against the forest state and starting living in the new
Harrow since, harrow since the farthest
Reach underneath inside a cheat
Something is alive, somewhere underneath
Caught between the real and the fake
I don't want to fit, there and has been found
Silence is so cold, and there's no sense at all
And I was someone else, I was something good
Barely in the old, there among the cold

Along the path I determined to hold
Although it coiled round a perilous wing
Blinded by hot gas and carving off steam

Add in the stirrings and long lost fatigue
Barrels that hide us in hair fallen heed

Took the nerve for unseen, feeling it go untrue
For a say what is true of chaos in too

Lives alone at the wildest day and then were taken home
Settled words were gone again were called upon

I was not laid those down below

Toby existed
Where nothing starts
Been in where we almost missed
Staggered that it did not flood
And I look back and see from under look
Pardon it for different reasons
Pardoned with the last self foot
And soft, and soft and sure leaves
Steady as the sea

There is so little left from the warmth of the sun

I wish I had understand my
Was never either bouncing call
Til I caught like a fragment of my single heart

Tepid and cold
Crawling lessons to the fold
Trace it by line
Light in the ground
Beating your fists to the sound

No one can look
I can barely run and the walls will travel on
Tear it into you, loss giving it all away
Who will run and who will say

All the help gathering now
Learn to be fly through what's left
All they sell, got it in me
Floating whats left in the stream
No one can run, I can barely walk

Where you are, arms length, tumble light it goes, I hardly knew

And then I see a brand new face, I glimpse some new neighborhood.
So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true.

Come into this house,

Lift up holy hands, our
Hearts in one accord
For He's worthy, worthy
Of all our praise
Stop dissin' just listen,
Let me kick a little slang

I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
Hang out
With power over demons
And anything that's
Wicked
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
Ticket
Look plain and simp', the
Devil's a pimp
The power of praise can
Heal your limp
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Flavor
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour

Abused, sold down the
River

Choose, you need to be
Delivered
With Christ you win,
Without Christ you lose

Lamb, you're smooth
Amputation situation first
Cut out the jive, cut into
Church
You need a healin' touch,
A big strong hand
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
Jam

And glory
Worthy of power

So to win their hearts one must quote with ease
Aeschylus ans Euripides
One must know Homer, and believe me, eau
Sophocles, also Sappho-ho

Dainty Debbies will call you a dope

But the poet of them all
Who will start 'em simply ravin'
Is the poet people call
The Bard of Stratford on Avon

Brush up your Shakespeare
Start quoting him now
Brush up your Shakespeare
And the women you will wow

Just declaim a few lines from Othella
And they'll think you're a hell of a fella
If your blonde won't respond when you flatter 'er
Tell her what Tony told Cleopatterer

If she fights when her clothes you are mussing
What are clothes? Much ado about nussing

James Wiggins,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

We are the sweeter kind.

James Wilson,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

James Wilson,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,1993
James Wolpert,"Just before our love got lost you said,
I am as constant as a northern star and I said,
Constantly in the darkness,
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice.

You're in my blood, you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet, oh I
Could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet.

I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints.
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid.

I remember that time you told me
Love was touching souls.
But surely you touched mine, 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time.

You're in my blood, you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet, oh I
Could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said,
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed.""

You're in my blood, you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet, oh I
Could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet",A Case of You [The Voice Performance],2013
James Wolpert,"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and
twist of fate
On a bed of nails
she makes me wait
And I wait... without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm,
we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you...
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied,
my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away

And you give yourself away

James Wright,"Come on and sit down, baby
I wanna tell you a story
I wanna tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be worth it (worth it)
She said, ""Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take that long
But I'ma tell you about His glory""

She said
My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said He gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need

I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in His blood
Saved my soul and He set me free
Now I'm praising the Lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until He saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!

Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
Well, then the reverend sighed tides and offerings
We livin' the benevolent lifetime, so stay right
I'm preachin' 'em teachin' 'em givin' em more than a look
My granny raised me right about the Good Book

She said

Is the man that died for me (man that died for me)

Said He gave me victory (gave me the victory)

Will supply your every need (supply your every need)

James Yorkston,"I Know My Love
I know my love by his way of walking,
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
Cho: And still she cried:""I love him the best
But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest.""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?""
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

",I Know My Love,2002
James Yorkston,"I didn't sleep at all last night
I thought my heart had mastered the run of these seas
But they appear not to care about calming lately
I awoke with a smart and a look at the phone.
I swear that I would have called you if I'd been sure you were alone.
And doesn't that drive things home?

The hardest time to forget is when sleep clears your mind,
Bringing up what might have been, and who's by her side.
And if I appear forlorn, that's the reason truly.
Should I find myself a surrogate to keep the winters warm
Blame her for my former love and blunt her of her charms?

Oh dear Saint Patrick, I pray for some water
Jut let me quench my thirst this morning after.
And this girl by my side, well who knows the future?
But if I appear forgetful she's the reason on my mind
If you detect a smile it's as I dream of foreign lands
And letting things get out of hand
Is exactly what I've got planned!",St. Patrick,2002
James Yorkston,"As soon as we get a fighting chance we could lose ourselves amongst the crowd my love
And you must know that I'm up for trying, forgetting all this civilizing row
And all these country miles are nothing, compared to taking a chance
And all these country miles are nothing, lady can't you read between the lines?

Because I found love and a thousand answers to the trapped little ghosts of a thousand glasses
I've been drinking less and sleep comes to me, if this is life touch wood it's easy
And you look so cosmopolitan like this is France or this is London town
Well let them go and pierce their features, we'll just stay and comb the beaches around

And how you sang 'bold reynardine' as the snow it glazed outside and around
And was is wrong to pray for more, if it kept you safe ashore in my arms?
And how we ended so close together, with all that space around the fire my love
And just for you this one little line, I loved being taken under your arm my love

We could fairly watch the fur fly, we could play at cat and mouse
I'm sure we've got Sweet Jesus on our side
As I believe in fate and you're a sucker for the stars
I'm sure we've got Sweet Jesus on our side, singing Sweet Sweet Jesus when will she be mine?",Sweet Jesus,2002
James Yorkston,"Before I jump ship, for cooler shores, may I gently close this account of ours?
Through all that I know and have loved is inside, I'm just losing faith in these costly times.
And I pray for your health and your peace of mind but God must now I just want you by my side.
And the mornings I've woken and sought your warmth
If only I'd held you and told you before


But I'm no fool, my heart is just exposed, I'm just weathering the flows
And I'm not the man you thought, I suppose, you leave me tender to the blues


And you phone me to tell me, of these regrets of yours
But I've been lying awake until the small small hours
And the wise men say I should fight for my cause
But I'm all punched out and just so so tired.

But I'm no fool, my heart is just exposed, I'm just weathering the flows

My visions all surrounding
The humans look like insects
There is only one way down
But it's cold and lonely in this stratosphere
Gliding through the darkness
Where is my craft leading to
Am I damned or blessed?
Don't let go on top of the world
Don't let go on top of the world
Will my good friends desert me
Or will they prove themselves?
Are my demands all greedy
Or are they what I need?
If I will not be faithful
I must accept betrayal
When your turn comes to leave me
Will my free ways have failed?
Don't let go on top of the world
Don't let go on top of the world
I'll meet you inside this hollow world
I'll meet you inside

And I'm so cold",Top of the World,1994
James Young,"Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photographable

Yet you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me.

And you're taking me too

So I'm making time for air

To kiss me when I'm yawning

In my head as I close my eyes at night
Empty sounds on my pillow
Empty words that repeat throughout the night

This has to be the best thing I could choose
How could I lose to you?

The rain falls hard on my window
I can feel the pain receding now
Close my eyes and I'm with you
Keep them shut till you see those floating stars

How could I lose?
This has to be the best thing I could choose
How could I lose to you?

I have strength when I'm with you
I have strength but my arms can't hold you up
From the water when I'm drowning
Like they said I would always drag you down

I will be right here
And if you love me

To the grave, I thought

I just can't seem to make it happen

You're always around me

I know you want me to hurt myself
Somehow, somehow

Whenever I'm lost
You're there with cross
To see how long it takes
For me to go and pray

I know you want me to hurt myself

And get off my back
And get off my back
