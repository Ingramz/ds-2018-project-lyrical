Timmy Regisford,"I'm quite sure
That you never knew
All the pain that I've been through
Even this morning
Looked outside my door
For your letter on the floor
Seven long years
Of moving through the streets
Letting people in
But they don't talk to me
They look right through
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through
Just like you (Just like you, just like you yeah)

Sun comes up, I'm alone again
With the lights on in my head
Still loves us the wing, from my little room
'Cause I gotta go back soon

Other people's lives, all the long goodbyes
Watching in the mirror with longing in my eyes

They look right through oh oh
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through oh
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)
They look right through (They're looking right through me)
Just like you (Just like you babe)
They look right through (I can't believe it)
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)

I can't believe it, no no no
How can you change your mind?
Look right through me all the time
I'm gonna give you every part of me
But you just wanted to be free, yeah

They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me

I'm wondering baby
Am I a piece of glass
In your mind?

They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me

I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
Am I a piece of glass
In your mind?

They look right through (Ho ho)
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through (Oh)
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)

Timmy T,"It's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappoint you
I didn't mean to tell you lies

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why

[Chorus]
One more try I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

It's been a long time since I kissed you
It always used to feel so good
And if you knew how much I missed you
You'd forgive me if you could

And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try (one more try)

Timmy T,"Time after time 
When we're together I tell you I love you 
Now & forever
You're doing me wrong
But there's nothing I can do

We've been through days 
Where nothing would go right
In your arms your holding me so tight
Please won't you let me come into your heart
We would make love 
Through raining weather
And go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me

Girl, why don't you just understand
Why I've got to be your man 
Why don't you let yourself go
Don't you know

Time after time 
My feelings get so hurt 
It will take both of us to make our love work
I'll give you love if you just give me a chance 
Once in your life see that this is real
Will it be pain & sorrow that I feel
If this is love won't you see it through my eyes 

Remember the days
When we would just hold hands 
Holding and kissing in the warm sand
Those were the times when I knew you cared

Girl, why don't you just understand
Why I've got to be your man
Why don't you let yourself go
Don't you know

Girl, why don't you just understand 
Why I've got to be your man
Why don't you let yourself go 
Don't you know

When we're together I tell you I love you 
Now & forever
You're doing me wrong 
But there's nothing I can do",Time After Time,1990
Timmy T,"When I met you, you meant the world to me 
But you were the type of girl that set love free 
Now I'm out cold, you stole my heart from me 
But I know someday you'll think back every memory 

Chorus: 
Now what will I do 
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 

Now love is gone 
You're far away from me 
You would have been so rich with love but set it free 
Now you want home but it's too late for me 
'Cause I won't be used and abused and then set free 

Chorus (3x)
",What Will I Do,1990
Timmy T,"I know it's over
You know it's over
We're just goin' through the motions
But we're sailin' separate oceans world's apart
And you know it's breakin' my heart

I was a dreamer
You were a dreamer
But perfection is consuming
And it seems we're only human after all
And we've both been takin' the fall

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end

Maybe we're older
Maybe we're colder
So we disregard solutions
While we cling to our illusions once again
And we keep rememberin' when

Seasons are changin'
Reasons are changin'
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
While the years keep slippin' away

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end


",Boats Against the Current,1992
Timmy T,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,1992

Timmy Thomas,"It's turning out just another day
I took a shower and I went on my way
I stopped there as usual
Had a coffee and pie
When I turned to leave
I couldn't believe my eyes

Standing there I didn't know what to say
Without one touch
We stood there face to face

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

You said hello then u asked my name
I didn't know if I should go all the way
Inside I felt my life have really changed
I knew that it would never be the same

Standing there I didn't know what to say
First time looked away when I whispered your name

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

One hello changed my life
I didn't believe in love at first sight
But you've shown me what is life
And I now I know my love (I know this love is right)

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside

To heal my wounds to lead me to the sun
To walk this path with me until the end of time

Who'd dive into the sea with me

And doesn't wish to feel the shame, anymore

To wash away the feeling of pain

Questo cortile
Occhi scuri intorno a me
Ho un po' paura
Il peggio verrà da sè
Anche questa sera
Il mio orgoglio griderà
Cieco dolore
Dicon: ""l'hai voluto tu...

La vita scivola
In questo inferno che
Non si apre che per me
Un uomo nudo
Lividi e ferite sai
Non fanno male
Quanto la mia libertà
Sotto stracci bagnati
Ma che cosa vuoi che sia
Per te che non hai pianto sul tuo tempo che verrà?
Un nome un dio io non ho
Per cancellare il buio dentro me
La polvere del ricordo servirà
A caricare l'arma dei miei anni
Ma il sogno non sparirà mai
È tutto quel che resta della mia dignità

E' un inverno freddo che si vive a casa mia
E la nebbia scava dentro
Il mio viaggio è l'unica certezza che ora ho
E la sera lenta sale
Vecchi contadini che assomigliano un po' a me
Stanno lavorando forte
Un poeta antico li cantava come eroi
Raccontandone I segreti
Ma dovrò andar via
Tu sei me Lombardia
Sono nato in questa forte e piccola città
E Milano mi ha adottato
Con le sue vetrine, I suoi locali, I suoi metrò
Le puttane e I baracchini
Penso a quanti giorni spesi insieme in osteria
Con le carte e col bicchiere
Penso a quante cose non so più trovare qua
La mia gente piano muore
Ma dovrò andar via
Tu sei me Lombardia
Resta qua casa mia
Vado via

Certi giorni questo viaggio
Sembra non finire mai
Ma se guardo alle mie spalle
Non ho perso molto sai
Non see'è tempo per pentirsi
Tutto appartiene a ieri
Quanti ladri, quanti amanti
Troppi santi, troppi eroi
Non si può tornare là
Ma se guardi l'orizzonte
Sei a metà del viaggio ormai
Non ti importa della gente
Cerchi l'immortalità
Ad un tratto il tuono e il lampo
Squarcia il cielo sopra me
Tutti nelle loro tane muore l'elettricità
Giace inferma la città
Mentre piove, piove
Son felice perchè
Lava queste strade
Entra dentro di me
E tu uomo intelligente
Non puoi farci niente sai
La sua forza in un istante
Può schiacciarti se vorrà
E l'odore dell'asfalto
L'erba, I fiori, il vento che
Mi vien voglia di spogliarmi
Voglio che entri dentro me
E distrugga ciò che può
Mentre piove, piove

Lava queste strade

Risveglia la città
Dormono le fabbriche

Vivo non lo so
E incontro anche te
Che corri a pregare un po' Dio

E penso che un tempo quel tempio era mio
E mi chiedo perchè un giorno ho detto addio
Corro via, ma non so se
Fuggire o rincorrere
Qualcosa forse chi
Sono qui e dentro me

Mi spinge fino a voi

Un'ombra si vendica
Tradisce e abbandona la luce
Si crea da sè

Non cerco una tana ma
Solo vie un po' più sicure
Dell'umana realtà
Mi sento già stanco e deluso
L'ennesima vittima
Il vento accarezza il mio viso e
Ora canta con me
Se saprai ascoltare
Non avrai paure, il guerriero vincerà
Dove nasce il mare
Ti darà la forza ti accompagnerà
Ma ecco una nuova visione
Si plasma nel fumo e
. l'uomo che ha avuto ragione
Non si fa scegliere
Ricordati queste parole
Quando ti sveglierai
""nel sole risplende il tuo nome,
Anche se non vuoi""

Sembri bella ora che
Vado via, visto che perdonare non so

In un'auto blu... dille che vale molto di più

Si disseta da sè

When the rain is blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When evening shatters and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it frm the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

Another place in time

You gotta come clean
You gotta say what you mean
Don't make a big scene and run

Give me love, give me hate
I don't want to wait
You've got nothing left to prove
Make me laugh, make me cry
But don't tell lies
Go on baby cut me loose
Give me just one moment of truth

Love is so much more than you take it for
You just forgot its name
You're too blind to see you're what's good in me
Why don't you feel the same?

You were my best chance
Don't give me romance
I want the last dance - I want you

Give me love, give me hate
I don't want to wait
You've got nothing left to prove
Make me laugh, make me cry
But don't tell lies
Go on baby cut me loose
Give me just one moment of truth

Say what you want to say
We'll go our separate ways
But I'll hold on to this love song
'Cause I hope you'll stay

Give me love, give me hate
I don't want to wait
Give me just one moment of truth

You gotta come clean
There ain't no in-between
I want to live my dream, and that's you

Give me love, give me hate
I don't want to wait
You've got nothing left to prove
Make me laugh, make me cry

Not so long ago
When I could just pick you up
And warm your soul

We'd sit and talk about the difference between
The world of bad and good
And I was doing the best I could

Bedtime stories
Read you off to sleep
Wishing you all my love
And sweet, sweet dreams

An' over in the corner, much to my surprise

All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.

Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Timothy Seelig,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Tin Henry,"""How ya doin' girls? Long time, no see.
Listen, I've been to the doctor lately.
Honey, I just spent forty dollars to hear that from that guy?""

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
The way he described it he said,
""You'd be better off dead than alive.""
I didn't listen to his jive.
I knew all along he was all wrong,
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
He said I need treatment.
But I'm not that easily led.
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind.
And he thought I was nuts.
No more if's or and's or but's.
Oh, no.

They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas.
But I knew what was happenin',
I knew I was a genius.
What's so strange when you know that
You're a wizard at three?
I said, ""Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me.""

I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.
But I had saw some crazy things
Before I came to.
Now, do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.

They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,
They all laughed at Edison,
And also at Einstein.
So why should I feel sorry if they just
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic
That went on in my head.
I had a brain, it was insane.
So I just let them laugh at me
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top.
Aaaaaaah.

""Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?""
Ba, ba, ba, ba!
""Oh, here she comes again.""
Badada, badada, badada. Wo!

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
But I said, ""Doctor,
I think that it's you instead.
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.
And you know two heads are better than one.""

Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song

Tina & the B-Side Movement,"Your arms are warm but they make me feel
As if they're made of cold, cold steel 
A simple kiss like a turnin' key 
A little click and the lock's on me 
Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands 
I won't admit to where I am 
But I know baby, I'm in chains I'm in chains 
I pretend I can always leave 
Free to go whenever I please 
But then the sound of my desperate calls 
Echo off these dungeon walls 
I've crossed the line from mad to sane 
A thousand times and back again 
I love you baby, I'm in chains I'm in chains 
I'm in chains I'm in chains 
Should have known passing through the gate 
That once inside I could not escape 
I never thought this could happen to me 
Never thought this is where I'd be

Tina & the B-Side Movement,"It was raining when I woke up this morning 
So to escape I... I went back to bed 
But then the rain started leaking through the ceiling 
And pretty soon it was pouring on my head 

Sometimes it follows you home 
Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

So I jumped into my car and hit the freeway 
Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

Well the moral of the story is 
Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning 

It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

Cause It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day

It's not the end, it's not the end, 
Still not the end, it's not the end, 
I betcha wonder when this song is gonna end
But it's not the end 'cause I'm singing this song 
And I get to decide when it's the end
And it's not the end , well it's altmost the end,

Demain tu seras baptisé

Sa voix d'échos en échos
Dit au monde qui s'étonne
See'est pour jean-françois nicot
See'est pour accueillir une âme
Une fleur qui s'ouvre au jour
A peine, à peine une flamme
Encore faible qui réclame
Protection, tendresse, amour

Loin des chemins loin des humains
Voici qu'après 19 années
Coeur en émoi le jean-françois
Prend pour femme la douce elise
Blanche comme fleur de pommier
Devant dieu dans la vieille église
Ce jour ils se sont mariés

Tout's les cloches sonnent sonnent
Leurs voix d'échos en échos
Merveilleusement couronnent
La noce à françois nicot
Un seul corps une seule âme
Dit le prítre et pour toujours
Soyez une pure flamme
Qui s'élève et qui proclame
La grandeur de notre amour

Des jours ,des nuits le temps a fui
Voici dans la nuit étoilée
Un coeur s'endort françois est mort
Car toute chair est comme l'herbe
Elle est comme la fleur des champs
Epis, fruits mûrs, bouquets et gerbes
Hélas tout va se desséchant

Une cloche sonne, sonne

Obsédante et monotone
Elle redit aux vivants

Dieu vous fera signe un jour
Vous trouverez sous son aile
Avec la vie éternelle
L'éternité de l'amour.""

Tina Arena,"Sous le vent et le ciel de traîne
Se mélangent colère et violence
Aussi loin que je me souvienne
Je vois des joies et des souffrances
L’envie d’échapper à tous mes silences
De ne pas rester sans une autre espérance

Jamais non jamais je n’ me laisse faire
Je livre mes combats
Jamais je n’ reste à terre
Au quotidien quand je me bats
Moi, j’ai mes peines et j’ai ma foi

C’est en vain que les maux reviennent
Je suis le chemin d’où renaît la chance
Maintenant entre terre et mienne
Entre les distances c’est là que j’avance
L’envie de donner sans une récompense
L’envie de crier pour une autre sentence

Jamais non jamais je n’ me laisse faire
Je livre mes combats
Jamais je n’ reste à terre
Au quotidien quand je me bats

Les mots que j’attendais,
Dans un souffle, un soupir,

A me gêner.
Il fallait tout me dire,
Jamais, non jamais,

Sur des regrets.

Avant que le temps, 
Le vent,
N’emporte les mots pour toujours.

Les promesses à jamais,
Pleurer ne veut rien dire

Tu aurais dû me dire,
Et nous délivrer,
Le silence est bien pire à écouter.

A l’ombre de ses chances.

Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty
I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

'cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going
Through they
Can't understand
Some try to tell me
Thoughts
They cannot defend
Just what you
Want to be
You will be
In the end

And I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you

Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written

'cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you
'cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you

Breath deep
The gathering gloom
Watch lights fade
From every room
Bedsitter people
Look back and lament
Another day's useless
Energy spent

Impassioned lovers
Wrestle as one
Lonely man
Cries for love
And has none
New mother picks up
And suckles her son
Senior citizens
Wish they were young

Cold hearted orb
That rules the night
Removes the colours
From our sight
Red is gray and
Yellow white
But we decide
Which is right
And which
Is an illusion

You got it easy, you don't know when you've got it good
It's getting harder, just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting, even though I know I should

The cold is biting through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit is frozen to the core
Don't wanna be here no more

And wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?

Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

I got it harder, you couldn't dream how hard I got it

I'd buy a big house 
Where we both could live 

If I was a sculptor

Or a man who makes potions 
In a traveling show 
I know it's not much 
But it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 

And you can tell everybody 
This is your song 
It may be quite simple 
But now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life 
Is while 
You're in the world 

I sat on the roof 
And kicked off the moss 
Well a few 
Of the verses well 
They've got me quite cross 
But the sun's 
Been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you 
That keep it turned on 

So excuse me forgetting 
But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green 
Or they're blue 
Anyway the thing 
Is what I really mean 
Yours are 
The sweetest eyes

It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to hide and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

Sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there

And I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again

We met this August afternoon
His insight threw me like a typhoon
And I was frail, I think he knew
Whispered words of great escapes

Forget yourself and leave it all behind
Wait at the bus stop tonight
Meet me at the head shop
And let me free and open up your mind
You and I will take off tonight

To remind me why I don’t remember
I’m kicking trash against the wall
Evening fades, still waiting to rise
No-one escapes undisguised

Forget yourself and leave it all behind

Into the dark of your coffee cup
To cover up your footprints
How many times have I heard you say stay
Won't you let me tie you up?
With minor cords and smoke rings

Can anybody with truthful eyes
See anybody they recognize
Careful confusion is a thin disguise
And I think you're losing it

I hear you've found someone to take the blame
Playmate, is it true?
She's fuel on your roaring fire
I hear she's nice but messed up just the same
Sweet kamikaze, dying proof

Tina Dico,"It was a mild and lively evening at the end of May
I had run out for one quick coffee at the corner cafe
I must have looked a little tense and over-worked, I guess
'Cause this old man leaned in and said
My darling, what's the stress? 
Come sit, come have a moment's rest
Your work is nothing worth unless
Your mind is calm and clear and at it's best

And he went on
To everyone who's running faster every day, he said
To everyone who's not found peace and independence yet and
To everyone who thinks that life is where they're headed to
Who thinks a better day awaits as soon as they get through
These busy years of things to do
This wall of greedy cynics who
Persuade them to give up their dreams too soon

Take your time
It's a quarter to forever right now
Take your time
It's a quarter to forever now

To everyone who thinks that love was just a dream they had
Who thinks tomorrow and the future has nothing new to add and
To everyone who's watched their hopes run out and slam the door
And everyone who still don't know what they are looking for or
Found it and dropped it on the floor
Whose hands and arms have gotten sore
From holding on too tight to what once was

Racing 'round the restaurant

Where you can't come back at all

Waltz around the rumor mill
In your faded dress with the daffodils

Ever since I was a little child
I was taught that in a little while
You would come for me so I can be with you
Through the years You were by my side
Never left You, even though I tried
Cause when I lost my way, You would clear the view

Chorus:
It's not too far where I'm going
It won't be long till the conclusion
When the story ends, You'll reign forever more
There's no fantacy in the knowledge
For the truth will be and time will tell it
Then the world will know for sure what I know

With a word You put the stars in place
With compassion saved me by the grace
that is flowing from the fountain of Your love
And I'm secure because I'm in Your hands
And I know You're coming back again
So I make this vow to let the whole world know

You can make it, when God is on your side
You can make it, though you don't have the strength to fight
No matter what the circumstance, still hold to what is true
You can make it, for God will help to see you through

Don't let the fear within you rule the day
For like forgotten dreams they'll fade away
And when you look back at the steps you've made
Through it all, though times were hard, He always made a way

Though the world may fall I know, I see sunlight through the rain over me.

I'm floating nowhere like
A wasp in October
Summer's over and done

These empty dreams of mine
Are out of place and out of time
Is just a grain of sand for me

Seasons change, memories fade
Daydreams fall like golden leaves

Another day
I'm watching dreams just slip away
The summer moon

Gives way to autumn's dusky bloom
Seeds I've sown
Are almost spent, I'm here alone

Wandering, I roam
Beneath the half light of forgotten sunsets
Searching for my home

Inside this lonely place
I'm chasing shadows like a wasp in October
Fading in the wind

Seasons change, memories fade
Daydreams fall like golden leaves

Um dia de mas
Meu sonho desapareceu
Lua no céu

Rio da noite, coração
Sozinha aqui
Você não lembra mais de mim

Hear the punch line on the radio

Tina Malia,"Down from the water she crowns her head
Down from the water she grows
Down from the water she casts a spell
Down to the water she goes

Awaken the day with your morning light
She touches your shadow with fire
And in the shade of her open arms
She harbors your burning desire

And the more that you love her
The more that she grows
The more that you run from her
The more that she knows
The more that she knows

I can see by your eyes you’re a wise old man
I can tell by the way that they burn
Your beard has been growing six thousand years
While you’ve waited for her to return

And the more that you love her
The more that she grows
The more that you run from her
The more that she knows
The more that she knows",Isis,2002
Tina Malia,"Long is the river, flowing to the sea
And in my blood a shiver, rising in me
Across the horizon, far beyond the sky
Is a land that I dream of
Where a sparrow takes flight

And you come to me like a flame 
I warm my hands on the breath of life
Still haunted by the coldness that came
Torn between the love and sorrow inside

And you come to me like a thorn
A garland of roses around my head
Sweet and sacred as the sun
Beautiful ‘til my fingers bled

Under the black, under the night
Under the darkest thing you know
There is a light, there is a fire
There is an everlasting glow
And I’ll meet you there, in the lilac blooms
And well dance and sing under the rising moon

And there is a place I know
Where a songbird sings high upon a hill
I can hear her from the knoll
When my breath is quiet ad the air is still

Under the black under the night
Under the darkest thing you know
There is alight, there is a fire
There is an everlasting glow
And Ill meet you there, in the lilac blooms
And we’ll dance and sing under the rising moon

And you leave me now for a while
Long is the journey to the other side
But I am comforted still
When I think of you smiling like a child",Lilac Blooms,2002

Fade away into the night
Fade away my enchanted one
Rest your emerald eyes

We will dance in the new day’s sun
We will sing the angel’s song
We are all chosen ones

Don’t you cry sweet butterfly
Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing
When the moon in her fullness lies
She will birth all our dreams

Fade away into the night
Though the sun it faces away
Our love will never die",Lullaby,2002

The time has come
To cross the Tintagel sea
The fragrant air, the apple blossoms
Have all been beckoning
And there we’ll stand
Looking out upon the world that we’ve known
All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

You’ll be greeted there
By maidens fair
With eyes of the royal sea
In the garden they will braid your hair
With violets and rosemary
And there we’ll stand
Looking out upon the world that we’ve known
All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

Feel the wind on your face
As we cross the stormy sea
Close your eyes, don’t look back
There’s nothing left to see

The other night you came to me
Like an angel you appeared
And we climbed the endless sky
And held each other near

All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

Tina Malia,"There is a thundercloud in my heart, beating down
Drenching the soil of this shameless battleground
And I would not run away, I would not even try
For the silence that comes to find me
Is worth the turbulent night

And I am wasted away in the eye of the storm
I am wasted away in the eye of the storm

Take my flesh and bone,
You can have this foolish pride
Take the stories and the tales
Leave me nothing more to hide

Man you're a legend all over town

Sometimes I wonder if you've ever heard
The sound of a broken heart
It ain't real pretty, it ain't the thing the nice folks talk about
And the hardest thing you'll ever have to do
Is face the one who's done it to you

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,

Finding another world.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever

Hearing words that I have never heard

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Tina Sinatra,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 

First it was nothin', not even, a fake ? 
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along 
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes 
Thought I'd never feel this way again 
And you were supposed to reach my heart 
And find love within, love, love 
Oooh...oooh 

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love 
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me 
Wonderful 

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near 
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared 
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend 
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again 

Fall in love again, in a storm 
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses) 

Just when I thought I'd seen it all 
Our paths crossed, amen 
And I knew, from the first glance 
That you, would be hard to forget 
Your eyes, attracted me first 
But you reeked of sultry confidence 
I couldn't wait, to touch lips 
And kiss, with my heart's intention 
When we didn't, was what I expected 
And for that moment, we erased the tension 
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters 
And the initial blind date, first impressions 
We kissed again; and I felt the passion 
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin' 

We made love, within a storm 
In the midst of passion and chaos 
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost 
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder 
Those who prevail this drama 
Will learn to bring their love farther 
But now, the storm has past 
And the seas of our friendship are gone 
But as long as I live, I will remember 
The love within a storm 

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line) 
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love 
Ya know that I miss you, and love you 
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart

I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

That I might have been queen

For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation

Let the waters rise

From the gates of the city

With my senses of old
And the heart of a giant

Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes
No election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
If they could see what's going on around here

Makes me want to take a joyride

It seems now that nothing is right, there's nothing but pain.
If only I'd told you I love you, now all I can do is

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling.
I don't feel right on this sad night.
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow.

If you could believe in me, then I could be strong,
And then we could set our love free and right all these wrongs.
You'll know when I touch you how much you still mean to me, baby.

Hold on, hold on.

Just give me one more chance.
Please give me one more chance.

Tina Turner,"Some boys got the look of a Greek Adonis 
Some boys try to talk you off your feet 
Some boys they're gods gift to woman 
Some boys think they're sweet enough to eat 
Try to change the habit of a lifetime 
Don't even try 
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing 
You realize 

What you get is what you see 
Ain't nothing more to it 
And if you want to love a woman like me 
It takes a man to do it 
If what you get is what you see 
Then I don't want your kind of love 

Some guys got lips that you can't help kissing 
And some guys got a smile you can't resist 
Some guys gotta build a reputation 
They just want to add you to the list 
You got a lot of physical attraction 
I can't deny 
But can you guarantee me satisfaction 
While I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting

What you get is what you see 
Ain't nothing more to it 
And if you want to love a woman like me 
It takes a man to do it 
If what you get is what you see 
Then I don't want your kind of love

Before I buy 
I always read the writing on the label 
So give me reason to believe there's more to you than meets the eye",What You Get Is What You See,1988
Tina Turner,"Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel 
When things are going wrong, why don't you ask me how I feel 
The night is awful cold, ask me how I feel 
You're much too loose to hold, why don't you ask me how I feel 

I close my eyes to follow you 
To my surprise you're so untrue 
And I'm crying, I'm dying 

Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel 
When you keep me hanging on, why don't you ask me how I feel 
The waters run so deep, ask me how I feel 
When I don't get any sleep, why don't you ask me how I feel
 
And when you're down you lean on me 
You're a fool, too blind to see 
That I'm crying, I'm dying 

Oh I'm waiting in the storm, why don't you ask me how I feel 
What the hell is going on, why don't you ask me how I feel 
When you stay out late at night, ask me how I feel 
When you think that I'm uptight, why don't you ask me how I feel oh 

You don't treat me tender no matter what I do 
But I'm the great pretender 

I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel 
What the hell is going on? 
When you stay out late at night 
You never ask me how I feel, you just say that I'm uptight 
When you're down, I do for you 
And now I find that you're untrue",Ask Me How I Feel,1989
Tina Turner,"You got the right to tell me it's all over 
It isn't like me to be begging you 
Don't let go, don't let go 
Just stay with me another day

I'm so confused I don't know what to do 
But don't give up, don't give up 
It just may take a little time 

Be tender with me baby 
I'm so afraid you'll go away 
Be tender with me baby 
Always, for always 

I know that you've been patient with my weakness 
And that you hate to see me cry 
But I know, yes I know

I'm so afraid you'll go away

I hope you see this is not really me

Tina Turner,"Really brings me down, I don't know how 
That you can say you're not my kind 
Couldn't find a cloud for miles around 
Why do you change your story line 
It all goes gray again sometimes I don't know when 
To come out of the storm 
It feels like forty days and forty nights I've been 
Beating on your door 

I'm falling like rain 
Oh I, I love ya, love ya, love ya 
Falling like rain 
Oh I, I'm coming down around ya 
I will always think about you 

My sentimental ways don't seem to phase you 
I don't ever want to force your hand 
If you met me one time, just half the way 
I could meet you where you are 
Just meet me where I am 
'Cause every now and then you've gotta drive right in 
Deeper than deep 
You take a chance and then you give the wheel a spin

Tina Turner,"A one in a million chance 
You know the moment that you crossed over the line 
A casual glance 
No one has to read between the lines 
In the south of France it was spring time 
Special feelings come alive 
There's romance in the air, so they say 
Love could be a small cafe away 

Love is a piece of cake 
And making love is all there is to eat 
It's a heart out of a lamb 
When you start to feel forever in a kiss 
But you must remember there's no point of refuge 
You only have a part in a lover's play 
And you could be the one left in the dark 
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart 

All too soon you're touching for the last time 
No one has to tell you how it is 
It's just a memory two people share 
File it under foreign affair",Foreign Affair,1989

I know about love and I know

I don't even want to say goodbye 
I just want to hold on 
To this true love, true love 

Women who have made mistakes 
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances 
She will play the waiting game 
She's never impressed by those manly advances 

I know I've only just met you 
Maybe I should know better 
But when you look at me that way 
There's something inside that's so right 

I don't want to lose you

Last night we tried to talk, the words got caught in our throats

Baby look me in the heart 
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby 
And it's not in my mind 
Can't you look me in the heart

Should've been a heart of stone 
When you stopped me to say hello 
Would've been twice as easy 
To just say no 
'Cause I don't want to lose at love again 
But as a couple we were quite handsome 
And the moon was out that night 
So we let our hearts go dancing 
If that thing is missing in my life 

There's not enough romance in this world 
There's not enough romance in this world 
There's too many people thinking only of themselves 
You gotta give love for its return 

Want to sing about new lovers 
Stand up against the odds 
Nothing can change a thing that strong

I got my love to share 
And when you need something so tender 
What you're looking for is so rare 

There's not enough romance in this world

You gotta believe in what your heart tells you is right 
And I'm here to say that I believe in love 

We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games 
But that's the only price that you gotta pay 
We gotta keep believing hungry hearts run free

Tina Turner,"I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
My and my woman was just getting' right
All systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows - zero visibility
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine a woman all night
With good intent
But there's something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

Steamy windows - ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer
And it starts things happening again

Steamy windows - coming from the body heat
Steamy windows - steamy windows",Steamy Windows,1989
Tina Turner,"She was my lover
She was working undercover
Oh the woman knew all of the moves
She really had me rompin'
We were barefoot stompin'
She just kept igniting my fuse

I was blinded by the blackness
Of her long silk stockings
She was rocking with an optical illusion
This ain't how I'd thought it'd be
She just kept on keeping me
In a total state of confusion

She took me for a ride
Rattled me down to my shoes
And I found out
She was an undercover agent for the blues

She never really needed love
Omnidirectional
I was just an innocent bystander
She kept on getting kinkier
I sank hook, line, and sinker
Just, just, just too hot to handle

She took me by storm
It must of been a season for the fools
She's so bad
An undercover agent for the blues

Tina Turner,"I heard some news this morning 
And it almost devastated me 
It hit my heart without a warning 
The story is on the street 
I overheard a conversation it was all about you 
I can't believe what they're saying baby, it better not be true 

They say you know who is doing you know what 
How am I supposed to feel 
You know who is doing you know what 
I thought our love was real 

They say you can't believe everything you hear 
But you've got me feeling insecure 
I thought you and I had a good thing going

I'm gonna have mixed emotions when I see you tonight 
I'm afraid I see the true story when I look in your eyes 

They say you know who is doing you know what

You know who is doing you know what

Till the moment is right
I won't give up the fight
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier
Like a phoenix arises
Ain't no mountain too high
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier

Like the eyes of total strangers
Our future is unknown
In a world of hidden danger
Don't want to be all alone
Like a rainbow and the starlight
I'll keep holding on till you're mine

Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what I might say (missing you) 

 There's a message in the wire 
And I'm sending you the signal tonight 
You don't know how desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard to understand

Let me tell you about a man I knew 
Yeah, I knew him all too well 

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight 
But not for tomorrow 
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford 
More than you can borrow 
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I 
Pick their pockets hey 
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train 
And make my getaway 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 

I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes 
Did something strange to me 
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride 
But there was a fork in the street 
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules 
That I've been taught 
You never get involved, never drop your defences 
But this time I got caught 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart

Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
when you do what you do without love, without love

The only colour I need is blue 
You're out of love, baby you know it's true 
Tell me why and I'll try to understand 

 Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough

And now I've gotten no much more

There's a time for love and a time for healing 
Can't go back and undo what's been done 
The word of mouth, time is revealing 
Just how far we've left this kingdom come 
Hand in hand we're finding our way 
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Kiss of life and the hand of fate 
Boy grows up into his father's son 
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate 
To carry on the way it had been done 
All our lives, it's debts to repay 
Maybe someday we can put the past away 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down

Los momentos de los dos
La distancia, las pasiones
Encontrar una razón,
Hoy como siempre,
Estoy pensando en ti, si ya ves

Son humanas condiciones
El sentirse bien o no,
Si es de día o es de noche,
Si es nostalgia o desamor,
Hoy, como siempre
Estoy pensando en ti

Como si nuestro tiempo no hubiera pasado ya.
Dime dónde estamos, que podrá pasar,
Corazones flechados pero de cada cual
Esa es la barrera que hay que derribar
Estoy pensando en ti
Estoy pensando en ti

Son las cosas de la vida.
Van unidas siempre así
El esfuerzo y la fatiga que supone estar aquí
Hoy, miro al cielo
Con los pies en el suelo, por que
Ser humano es lo que quiero ser
Con mis manos yo lo alcanzaré

Son las cosas de la vida
Nunca me acostumbraré
Casi siempre es una herida
Que tu corazón no ve
Hoy, como siempre
Solamente pienso en ti

Esta noche que pasa lenta, rozándome
Trato de afrontarla, aferrarla
Y derrapo en las curvas de tu corazón, por que

Quiero provocarla, y que sepas que
Estoy pensando en ti
Estoy pensando en ti

Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before

You gave me the freedom to go on my own way

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming you just let it fly

You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings

I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on 
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why 
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways

There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away

Feel his presence in the crowd 
Other girls they gather around him 
If I had him, I wouldn't let him out

Golden chain, take him to the spot

Women he has wanted grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

Tina Turner,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2008

I was searching for myself
When I found an angel

Too scared to land
There was stardust in my eyes
When I crashed into something I've never felt before (whoa)

Cause I'm right here in your arms
And it's time that I live and its time that I give you more

And I love you baby river deep mountain high",River Deep Mountain High,2009
Tina Turner,"Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can`t make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains

We don`t need another hero
We don`t need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome

Looking for something
We can rely on
There`s gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

All the children say
We don`t need another hero
We don`t need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don`t need another hero
We don`t need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide

Would break my heart in two

Tina Turner,"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
I'm just about to love my mind

Honey you've got it
And what you need
Baby you've got it

All I'm asking
Is for a little respect when I come home

Do me wrong
Honey if you wanna
You can do me wrong
Honey while I am gone

But all I'm asking for
Is for a little respect when I come home

Hey little girl, you're so sweeter than honey
And I am about to just give you all my money

All I'm asking for
Is a little respect when I come home

Hey little girl, you're sweeter than honey

Tina Turner,"What would you do if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in love at first sight
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see hen you turn out the light
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody

Tina Turner,"Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight.

I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks,
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,
But I'm the envy of ev'ry single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style,

But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true.
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.

I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,
I guess her folks brought her up that way,
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,

No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son.
She says give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry,

And it's all right, what I can't do, 
Out of sight because my heart is true,
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah, 
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.",Uptight (Everything's Alright),2012
