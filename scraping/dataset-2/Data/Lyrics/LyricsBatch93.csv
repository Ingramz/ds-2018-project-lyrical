Cy Coleman,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1955
Cy Coleman,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1955
Cy Coleman,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1955
Cy Coleman,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Cy Coleman,"I've got your number
I know you inside out
You ain't no Eagle Scout
You're all at sea

Oh yes, you brag a lot
Wave your own flag a lot
But you're unsure a lot
You're a lot like me, oh

I've got your number
And what you're looking for
And what you're looking for
Just suits me fine

We'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

I've got your number
And I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
And more

So go ahead and pick a number
From 1 to 10
You're losing streak is over
I can't win again
And here's the punchline
You've got mine",I've Got Your Number,1963
Cy Coleman,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

",The Colors of My Life,1980
Cy Coleman,"Come follow the band wherever it's at
Let both of your feet beat time to the drum
And let your heart go rat-a-tat-tat

A flag in your hand, a plume in your hat
Battalions of brass pass and catch the light
Is there a sight that's sweeter than that?

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a Daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Hear the trumpet blast, heat the cornet blare
Hear the boom of the bass and the rattle of the snare
With the sweetest burst of melody I know goes the piccolo

Hear the silver tone of the xylophone
Hear the glide and the bellow of the slide trombone
Then a burst of crystal, listen to it peel, it's the glockenspiel

With the most majestic manner
You'll remember all your life
Comes mellophone, comes saxophone
Comes sousaphone, comes fife

Then the brass sings out the woodwinds sigh
The trumpets shout and the drums reply
With a crash and a bang as the whole she bang goes by

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Cy Coleman,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come,2002
Cy Coleman,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your're leading me to

But one that I'd never switch

Cy Coleman,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Cy Coleman,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Cy Coleman Trio,"Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Yes, miracles can happen,
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel,
That was the night I fell in love.",A Sinner Kissed an Angel,1996
Cy Feuer's Orchestra,"Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely,1994

If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?

Can't nobody heal me, won't somebody help me

broke wit no be	-i's feelin hella sad
I lied
I stole
always hella bold
but I make no progress, never reachin no goals
my potnas they used to, smash and bash
talkin trash wit no remorse cappin on my raps
even worse than that to make me feel low
they drunk all they Hin, and smoked all the dope
and girls used to say ""Num you're so cute""
""but you get's no action 'cause you have no loot""
well one day walkin down Six-Duce
I seen a brother wit Shelly he's lookin hella juiced
he said ""Here ye here ye, check out my thang""
""if you can rap real good and got songs you can hang""
""I already got a rapper Dru Down I'm bout to start""
""you can rap on his tape if you can rip it apart""
so I ran home and wrote a new song
the tape went platinum it didn't take hella long
got a couple of checks and I, brokes out
moved to Hollywood, now they think I sold out.

*(Chorus-Luniz, Cydal & T Luni)*
Uh.
When you makin mo mail then they could
hatas think you goin Hollywood
Never would, Hollywood.
When you move up out the hood
hatas think you goin Hollywood.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Verse 2 *(T Luni)*
All right stop what ya doin
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image of the game that ya used to
I look bummy
but peeps I'm makin money see
so yo world are you ready for me
now gather 'round, I'm the new playa in town
if you got mo grip then me, then I lay you down
I drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
so step aside, it's time to introduce myself
I'm T the Luni
surrounded by doobies
condoms and groupies, love me more then they do Lucchi
(you do your thang)
an all the notches in the top ten
please allow me to do it
I'm a freak, I like the girls wit the boom
I once got busy in the studio bathroom
I'm crazy
straight gangsta mack
I only stay if baby got back
I'm serious
they want to swallow me like licorice
I never faze back, girls they too ticklish
an wouldn't ride no hoochie in the hood
they think I'm too good, rumor has it that I'm Hollywood.

*(Chorus)* x1
Verse 3 *(Cydal)*
I can't be broke 
I inhale too much bomb smoke
the game is savage, makin cabbage in the city of dope
when I'm home I'm writtin songs, an I don't stop
nobody step up, or press up, when I set up shop
I used to stand in the crowd, watch the dope fiends an wonder
man who them fools in the ice cream van
that's Nummy-Num and Yuk trick, don't you hear the music?
playas always haven't, but playa hatas use it
been out for the cash since the day I was born
til I changed it, rearranged it to a street game form
I write a rhyme, anger feedin 'em
every show you see me in
deep in M.O.B., 'cause ain't no folks surviving greediness
fiends being wild, so they need to be tamed
so I keep 'em all in shackles, 'cause they gotta be chained
then I'm back to the honey comb
where hustlas get they money gone
Oakland ain't no joke, we all no it ain't no funny bone
a public enemy
not even a friend of me
the Mobb, will stand beyond the click that why'all pretend to be
so don't be givin me this and that about the hood
'cause they know it's all good
I never could go Hollywood.

*(Chorus)* x1
Verse 4 *(Yukmouth)*
I play the landlord, you be the apartment
you all know my name Smoke-A-Lot I gotta spark it
to get yo bitch started
who roll the hardest
me as the artist I gotta come out the largest
Yuk, I squat a Lexo's an Num's squattin Pala's
it ain't about who ballin 'cause we all clockin dollas
that's why 
I packed as an eagle
people be lookin at me smokingly roll by bomb-beagles
rap is like a kilo, of cocaine
illegal business and we in this dope game
buying so-an-so I'm a playa, I'm a mack
huh, but to me you ""geek-geek"" off crack
I smoke sacks wit the purple heads around from the Town
put that backyard boogie down,
you puffin wit Yuk, you know I blow greenery
you want to be like me the Ice Creamery
if yo ass ain't know by now I hits the scenery
so cleanery, sittin on chrome eighteeneries
I smoke a beedie, a tampa to the wood
mainly what I write is for the homies in the hood

Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,
We all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this

Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me
Here is where her heart

I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me

And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life",Sin City,2012

Fuck you busters and you suckers, you ain't shit in my pupil
Toaster in the kitchen, but I ain't fixing a stroodle

Thinking here lately that half this shit shouldn't phase me
Yet the media chauffeurs the crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Now is my net gross enough to even consider about saving
It's just a hard and a knock life
Where opportunity can't get right, it left us all in plain sight
To blinded to see, we can't believe it, yet it's true
What's hope without faith? Do you have a clue?
Another lost one falling, 
We all victim to the system yet racism they call it
Now what's a law abiding citizen
When the law can't abide what's being placed before the citizen
'Cause that don't make no sense
Just like the one extra penny you paying monthly on rent
I know the struggle is real cause this is everyday life
Too many dying and killing, some even take their own life

Years ago I heard this
Mama told me there'd be days like this
Who would have thought that it would switch, in time to reminisce
Stories that go untold like criminal minded shit
Some many hop on the band wagon just to say they support it
Wanting self glorification just to feel so important
I can't breathe
Just know the fact to these things
Instead of appearing just to be on the scene
You niggas ain't on the team
Believe me, cause I done witness some shit
Been apart of and accused cause I fit the descript
Should it be this way, nawl too much shaded grey
Areas and barriers that's placed in our way
'Cause I be speaking as a whole, when I speak unto you
Everybody wanting change but they fearing it to
I know the struggle is real, this is everyday life

I always hear people say, 
I’m always broke, ain’t got a dime to my name
And I hear them hope for change
That seems to be taking it’s time coming
They hope better dayz are ahead
They think things aren’t as bad as they were
Those people are dead
Alive, but dead and breathing
Forever wishing, on a star that doesn’t shine
What everyone forgot, a simple thing
Change is created by change
Is that too deep? 
Better dayz come with better ways
Better ways, 
Only sow what you want to reap

Keep us from tearing apart

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Say, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry, you
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear

If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting

Turned to gray

Eleven diamonds on the ring that he gave
I haven't seen him in eleven days
Eleven days, eleven days, eleven days

What am I doing?
Must be out of my mind
He pulled out the paper
And I signed on the line

He gave me two roses
He gave me two roses
One is open, one is closed
One is the future and one is my love

There were some things that people never needed to know
Guess there's one that you keep
That you bury so deep
No one can tear it out

And you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

Cyndy Duerfeldt,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings

Te veo bella y segura
No te borre del pecho amor
Mi pecho ha sufrido tanto tanto

El dolor que un dia senti
Se me curo con el tiempo
Que ironia, es la libertad
Esta libertad inexistente

Pero hoy se que algo pasara
Uuh, siento ganas, todavia es asi
Parece que jamas nos separamos

Cynthia,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try

It all happened so fast 
You said you love me 
And that it will last 
But know it seems 
That it was all a lie 
And all my love for you 
Is to pass you by 
My love for you 
Will never be the same 
My heart still aches 
From the sorrow and the pain 
Time has come for me to say good-bye 
Although the precious times 
Will never leave my mind

Your love was so easy and sweet 
Oh boy, I gave you all my time 
But why could not make you mine 
Why did you have to change on me 
Your love was so easy and sweet 
Oh boy, I gave you all my time 
But why could not make you mine

Was the best thing to do 
My love was to strong 
For both me and you 
You go your way baby 
I'll go me mine 
Searching for the love 
We'll  both hope to find 
If you decide 
To come back to me 
I'll be waiting so desperately 
Until then 
I hope to find 
Someone to love me baby 
All over the time

While my heart still lay deep inside for you 
Wishing and hoping for just one more try 
I refuse to wave the love we shared good-bye 
But it's not to late, no need to make you wait 
Your always in my heart, no need to hesitate 
It took us so much time for us to make it right 
So darling don't you wait, it's really not too late 

Chorus: 
So please make this an endless night 
With just a little love we can make it right 
Its there, I know I always loved you so 
I hope this endless night won't let you go 

Days pass by and still I wondered why 
The times we shared seem to slip us by 
The moments we spent were so few but true 
So come back to me, I'm still in love with you 
And though I know it may not be the same 
I'll try my best for now, no more time for games 
Cause deep inside I know our love is strong 
Knowing you and I would always belong

But it's not to late, no need to make you wait 
Your always in my heart, no need to hesitate 
It took us so much time for us make it right

I always loved you so 
Was afraid to let you know 
Can't you understand it's true 
That I'm still in love with you 
I love you, I need you to love me too 
Oh, be mine and I will love you all the time

Counting the blessings from up above

I'd hold you in my arms and I'd never let it end

I'm feeling so afraid, a love I have betrayed
Alone I cried and thought about the big mistake I've made
I wish I could explain, I'm the only one to blame

I've hurt enough of both of us and time will ease the pain
And how I regret that day and now that you've gone away
I'd give anything to bring you back home to me

If I had the chance to make love to you again
I'd hold you in my arms and I'd never let it end
If I had the chance just to be with you once more
I'd give the kind of love that you'd never had before

I've learned my lesson well my life's an empty shell
Without you, without you there's no story left to tell
I believe, I believe you and me can find the love we had

And you'd see that we can make it better
'Cause together we were once so strong but now you've gone
And how I regret that day and now that you've gone away
I'd give anything to bring you back home to me

If I had the chance to make love to you again
I'd hold you in my arms and I'd never let it end
If I had the chance just to be with you once more

Cynthia Clawson,"Someone said that in each life some rain is bound to fall
And each one sheds his share of tears
And trouble troubles us all
But the hurt can't hurt forever
And the tears are sure to dry

And it won't rain always
The clouds will soon be gone
The sun that they've been hiding has been there all along

And it won't rain always

The sun's gonna shine in His own good time
And He will see you through",It Won't Rain Always,1994
Cynthia Clawson,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could

For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly
From looking out to feeling free?

Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways

I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight

I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Comin' up in the world, don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin up
Looking in the mirror, dreamin about blowin up
The rap crowd, make money, chill with the honeys
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
It's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin with it
Nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears
And losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past,
Gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest
For the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Don't know how to act
48 tracks
Studio gangster, mack,
Sign the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese

You want to be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost
The route you took started collapsing
No fans no fame no respect no change no women
And everybody shittin on your name

You ever have big dreams of making real cream
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
And you want to look trendy
In the Bentley, be a snob and never act friendly
You want to have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be ok-acapo

Yeah, eat a bowl of dick'up fools!
Do ya wanna get crazy?
Comin' atcha in '93!

Through the car swings
The firing pins go click
When I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out of ammo no doubt my gatt is dry like a fuckin' drought

Got to make my way home
Hit the gate and get my chrome goddamn this song
They got me cornered lemme just warn ya
I'll pull this trigga make your family mourn ya

Boo-hoo! Where ya gonna run to when I pull out the Scooby Do
Run let me break ya off some, hit the floor 'coz it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin' punk, I'll break ya off somethin!

Break 'em off some
Break 'em off some
Break 'em off some
Break 'em off some

What the fuck I'm rollin'?
In a Mack truck that's stolen, guess what I'm holdin'?
Ammo to bust my load still I'm easin' on down
The yellow brick road

Whatta ya know?
A pig in a plain brown wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, lemme just warn ya
I'll bring ya ass down, make ya family mourn ya

21 gun salute, trying to take my loot
Don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a load
And punk, let me break ya of something

Break 'em off some
Break 'em off some

I got to roll with the self control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up, I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up

Got the pigs on my tail
What they get is the hollow point shell, caught in the sail
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice in the hood
But the nigga is senseless

Out on parole
Now the nigga has turned to my fold, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, wouldn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the fucker would stop
But nothin' would stop me from havin' to break 'em off something

Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin'
With the bitch-ass styles I hit you like Deacon
Jones house, cough without the bones
I rolled ya up and smoked you like cones
Split the seed and grow you like clones
Don't start-me-up, cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
But I get stoned with a little help from my friends
With the (gubla), then I passed it round back to me again
I can make you famous like Amos
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus

Yeah home direct ya

Take my weapon, step into a whole new realm
And step back, as I take up the helm
On the pirate ship I'm steerin'
Droppin' the geran
Just realize what you're hearin'
The cannon sounded
That's my companion: surrounded
As my crew comes bounding
As the captain
Afro-america
Whole lotta gattin'
With the loc'ed out latin
Busted!

You're a red beard with a musket
Better talk quick 'cause ya might get dusted
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted
Oh look away, look away boy as I rush it
Yes I know that you can't withstand it
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it
With a steel-toe, how you feel now
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo
Cry on a pillow, weeper that's willow
The Hill got the skill for the static like brillo
Hmmm, what you talkin' 'bout punk
Gimme room as I light up the boom
Cock the hammer, wave the white banner
Ever heard a Glock go 'click' like a camera?

Some say I'm no good
Claimin' I'm a criminal

I'm just one man man with a whole lot of homeboys

You get the click of the Glock
When I pull of the chrome toy
Check me and I'll check you back

Like I'm not a bad guy
But don't take advantage
I'm throwin' out the garbage
Just show me where the can is
All I was doin' was searchin' for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with a broom
Lucky I ducked quick
Or else I'd be assed up
Last thing I wanted
Was have to pull the gatt out
Here comes a nigga
And he's got a 38
Well my roundhouse said
Hey yo, I'm shootin up straight

Hug my kids, tell em I love em, my mouth, hit the fried
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hard to console tonight, feeling nobody's lost
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, I paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig

DJ Muggs cuts and scratches'This pig' from Pigs

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin news hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick SUCKED by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all FUCKED, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Look into the eye of the pig, I see it all

Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Look into the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
Watch this, a dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out ""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the FUCK out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the FUCKIN floor, I need no probable cause

Pigs in a wagon
Lookin' for the Afro - one that's saggin'

An' f***ed down too
Ploy me
Don't let your punk a** try me
Gonna take more
Then you better call your backup team
And wait for the crew
I'm the one flippin'
Keepin' the clip
On my hip an'
Just watch your back if you're slippin'
Oooo
Where did that .22
Come from
When the bullet past through my lung
I've lost my breath I'm winded
I've been hit, by a slug that wasn't intended
I hear thunder
I wonder
If a n**** like me's goin' under
Take a number!

Lick a shot!

Shit I still get down 
So just sit down 
When my thoughts stops crawling 
Time to sit down 
With yet I go wrong

And she make me feel strange 
Now I've got to call out her name

Damm and she always smells good

Are you experienced 
Have you ever been experienced 
Not for the life, make you delirious 
Why is the room spinnin' 
I can't stop now

So let me put my clip in, watch this nigga start flippin'
My, why must they always be trippin'?
Shut up, what up, fool tried to nut up
Dropped the gat, riccocheted, the fool got cut up
(Why'd you drop the gat, G?)  I got hit from behind
Now a nigga like me, I gotta go for mine
Bring it on, bing, make ya bells ring
When ya hit that pavement, what a feeling

Want me to let up, but I ain't tryin' to hear that

Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold

Now let it out

Got you by the balls

I don't know but that shit sounds good to me

Hit the joint, up the bomb, take a puff

Cooking up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleeping with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be coming to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence, crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-you niggas talking fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seeking, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speaking, wild as Indians
Tomahawk, Shaoling slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports

I'm taking these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Coming out the dime piece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashing your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surrounding me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not fronting or bragging, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon

Fools on the street want to feel the funk
Looking for the 'skunk' that's what'cha want
Ya better, sit back and let the track flow
Like smoke in ya lungs from puffin' on the indo
Rhythms upside ya brain, can ya hang, can maintain
Can ya feel the funk flowin' in ya veins
Get ya fix and ya bag of tricks
In tha mix I got the stix and stones a few bricks
I'm gonna hit 'em high

Open up ya mind so that you can feel the flow
On, an' on till there all gone

I'm the freaka

People always want to get what you got, no matta what
Can't take care of themselves in the big hunt
In the quest for the crown
An' the jewels, and the cheese

Enemies want to plot against me with envy in they hearts
But, I rip their sorry ass apart
In a minute, I can take ya to the limit

Motherfuckers be driving me up the walls
Hoping that I fall but they can suck my balls
Straight jacket, strap it
In a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from our reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
They all fucked up now
Cause they let a nigga back on the street somehow
I'm looking for someone like me
Living in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city looking at the ho wit the big titties
Looking at me and I feel shitty
A little tensed up getting hot
Cause she looks like my girl who just smoked at the crack spot
I'm trying to find ways to cope
But I ain't fucking round wit the gauge or a rope

'Cause I ain't havin' it, if ya got ya gat
Ya betta start grabbin' it, I can handle it

Lookin' back in the days of my youth no doubt
I didn't have any role models kickin' the truth out
So who am I supposed to look up to?
[Edit] on the corner, or the boys in blue
Now I had 2 choices, what could I be?
Down with, runnin' with the pigs or the g's
Let's see, a pig ain't done nothin' for me
But try to guide me to the penetentiary
The g's on the other hand want to see me
Callin' shots in the hood, recruitin' homies
Either way I'm [edit] unfortunatley
So I think I'll roll with the neighborhood family
G's in the hood are influential
Pigs on the street are detrimental
A g's got stripes on his credentials
Growin' up ain't easy in the Central

In the soul of the one holdin' the gun
Of the Assassin, elimination, blastin', assassination

And rooftops, scoped and aimed at your brain
Until we meet in the next world again
Until the year 2000 come on in my friend

An O.G. told me how to make some ends
To get the Rolex and the phat fuckin Benz
All I gotta do is take out a few friends
Disappear for a while then come back again
I used to have to hit them with the long range shot
In time I got better in the closer I got
The last thing I learned was the knife in hand
Blade to the throat, Oh, how I could kill a man
You could never understand how my mind works
The professional methods I use when I do dirt
Enemies and adversaries on the contract
No combat, I catch them in their Z's

[Chorus]
No one ever knows how the cards get dealt
In the hands of the maker when you break yourself
Why do I do do do things I do
Nobody was ever there for me to talk to
Once I was youngster, pure and true
Now I'm runnin' with the sick, sick crew
You could never understand what I go through
There could never be another [edit] fillin' my shoes
Sometimes I wonder how I made this far
In the gang set trippin'
Givin' up the set I claim
Pigs lookin' at me and they want to take aim

The opposite direction of the room, he pulled his gun and said

Word up you'll get hurt up like the jury callin murder
You're deaf 'cause i freak shit you neva heard of

Steppin to the park in the hill you can't hang
The original baby gangsta on this compton thang
Don't slip, the late night hype, is when i dip
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip

Can't feel me, if i was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, want to peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got
The green-eyed bandit, cypress hill, and the funk doctor spock

You wish you could hang, like i hang
Dwells in the see-p-t, the hood thing
G, the trigga finger, i'ma get you
Hit you, the tech 9, i'ma split you

Ain't no poppin, no stoppin
Tick to the tock, tick tock i hit your block
Throw your hands in the air, don't bite this

Like me, and you thought that you know me?

Whatta you feel? When you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?

Makin funky music is a must... I'm number one! *one echoes*

People still takin rappin for a joke
A passing hope, or a phase with the rope
Sometime I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MC's
I try and tell them, we're all in this together
My album was raw, because no one would ever
Think like I think, or do what I do
I stole the show, then I leave without a clue
Whattayou think makes up Cypress Hill?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but the break of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original, teacher of this type of style
Rockin off beat with a smile or smirk
Or chuckle, yet some are not up to
Cypress Hill Posse, so I love to
Step in the jam and slam, I'm not Superman
Cause anybody can
Or should be able, to rock a turntable
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that, a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no one's from the old school
Cause rap is still a brand new cool
I say no one from the old school cause rap on the whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
Cause we'll be the old school artists
And even in that time I'll say a rhyme
A brand new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin around, spendin money havin fun
Cause even then, I'm still number one! *one echoes*

Soul Assassin crew of course
Comes to express with styles galore
Ways of rhyming, old and new
Past and present, knock knock who is it?
A brand new style, RRRAH time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
And after all you can say you saw
Cypress Hill, stompin once more
I play it by ear, I love to steer
The fifty-seven Bel Air from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
Cause I'm not stupid I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin, because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old school artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper whose had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots, posing as kings
What are we here to rule, I thought we're 'sposed to sing
And if we are to sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated open your mouth and speak
A Cypress Hill soldier, is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin, overseas people dyin
Politicians lyin I'm tryin
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
From bringin out the truth in the song
So see-H-P short for Cypress Hill Production
Made a little noise cause the crew was sayin somethin
People have the nerve to take me for a gangsta
An ignorant one, somethin closer to a prankster
Doin petty crimes goin straight to penetentiary
But in the scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compellin me, to explain the silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple, Cypress Hill will teach reality
No beatin around the bush, straight up, just like 'My Weed is Free'
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, cause I'm still number one! *one echoes*

The deuce never stop, I refuse to play by the rules
Uptight, when you stepping into the night, right
Pigs coming up and shining the bright light
Nothing better to do, than fuck with the pride
When you hide behind your badge, your gun and ride
Billy club show me no love, think you above
All the fuss and the locs is rushing in too close
Let me lay it on the table, forget stable
Freak niggas, coming to slay to the label
You got nothing to lose, come on choose
Stay away from niggas that bring down your crew
Whatever it takes, you make or break yourself
With the wealth or the chance to stay in good health
Sword blade swinging you back off away
And the track off the real, straight off the Hill
What the deal motherfucker?

Taking this pencil, across the brain
Ain't stopping there til the rhymes all drained
All out my system, take em, and then I twist em
Put em out one day and see, who want to diss em
As you fold I'll sting ya, run up and you bitch up
Y'all get the picture, just call Mr. Excitement
Coming with the thunder and lightning
Shit is quite frightening how niggas keep biting
So I keep the writing, down for the fighting
Cold with the flows, they both quite exciting

The question, filling your body with intention
Don't mention the profession, keep adressing
The real motherfuckers in the crowd pay attention
I'm goin the fuck out, Smith and Wesson
You better stall me out, no extension
Only the strong will ever be setting the pace
When you look up I'm gone and never left a trace
No worries, set you with flurries and no juries
Eight million stories in the city of furies
Don't get the twist, you listen or get the fist
I got nothing to lose so I gat fools with this

A group that is simply just marvelous, just marvelous

16 men on a dead man's list
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

So many fucking emcees claim supremacy
On whose got hip-hop locked, it could never be
One who is solo, running the whole game
That's bullshit, like cops never sniffed cocaine
But I'm taking on all comers, dropping bombers
Reducing numbers, making it hot like the summer
This, one emcee he couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill, I rolled his ass down the Hill
Beaten broken and coughing and choking on the rhyme
Like a hooker, sucking a dick for the first time
His, rhyme was hollow with no flow to follow
Bust a nut, all in your mouth, and made him swallow
I take 16 emcees, lock em in a room
Make em feel the contact, eating the mushrooms
Playing with your mind, making you feel the Force
Had to cancel out, two punk niggas up in The Source
Tried to get XXL, they still fell
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montel

16 men now there's 13 left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

The physical, better run to the spiritual
Ass-whoop critical, or you can get it
From the lyrical, bitch-made niggas are invisible
Dysfunctional, hypocritical, smile in your face
The fucking cynical shit brains
As I sit back and say, tally-ho!
One of these days your punk ass gonna go
Guess you had a key to figure the fucking flow
But you're locked out, and the bomb's about to blow

16 men let me see who's next
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

Twelve punks to go, who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed overcame the nigga who at all costs
Changed up to gain it all, but shared none
Who made him all the money to overcome?
Niggas up on the Hill, in the lab
He was rolling big balla style, high profile
Oh child, make me want to act juvenile
All smiles, right in my face, but wait a minute now
Welcome to the 360, degrees
Pay a fee when you fucking your people over the cheese
No soul, no conscience, no loyalty
To the niggas who got him treated, like royalty
Hey yo time's up, you're gonna end up seeing visions
Of everybody, you fucked over, you're Scared Sober

Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go
16 men till there's no one left

Fuck the hater with the symbol and no soul
And that bitch nigga who stole my car stereo
Trick Deez, gets no love, she gets nuts
Like Ass Miller, and that fucking ex-dealer
Can't forget the nigga who was down with the Hill-a
And that punk who tried to dip into the squealer
You get bucked like C. Tucker and Will Bennett
Let me step, over the hump, and represent it
You go down like Jerry, and get smacked

With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, covering the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down

Attention
You creating hysteria
Attention [Repeat: x2]

When people stare at the scene like a machine of the team
Looking for theme between cracks searching for cream
Physical image can never be lost
Never be cleverly read or took on into the search of your own
Suckers are looking for treasures and pleasures endeavours images of plastic
Material whenever your ready your steady rolling with deadly and friendly
Territorial glorious story you've heard nothing but bull for me
Coming from ghetto the g'ero the heart in the metal
Settle for gas as we passing you fast in the pedal
Head to the floor and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to FUCK OFF!!
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws
That's what you get for faking it hot and no more
Living I'm sucker I'm pushing the bomb.

Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more

We ain't joking serve it up oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust.

? is loaded with snakes serpents who come and they take
Pieces of those who they break bodies are found in the lake
Only the victims its pass you thought that you gonna last
Pockets all over the cash now that you're actually grass
High kids taking and slipping away
Look at you tricking and sipping its clicking the trigger
And so is your place
Only the strong will survive hoping to keep 'em alive
I'll never be denied watch on who you can find
People around and they're proud looking for those
Who obye dying like these killers defy so I keep up the withdrawal
Join fucking with the pace your just a waste in my face
Hit you in base in your case if all you want is a taste
Even the lemo the rebel bringing the metal in temple
So many rebels incredible time we battle
Looking for action don't judge us avenge us redempt us
Don't give me negligence your all though in time no revenges

[Chorus]

Under the heavens we representing directions of flesh and feeling the heat
The tension now dissin' we stressin'
Life is a battle to the cattle you gonna die
Just how that'll just suffer your glad you built up your high
And go up the chain the pages keep turning and burning
The rage is concerning the day is becoming disarming
Searching for harmony you wanna be balling me
But you never get no where cause I'm killing your whole philosophy
Robbing like temperature I signal your flow when we just clowning
Just tell me just pass me watch me I'm truly tampering y'all
Must be simple delinquent to try to get what the sick is
So leave the hard is to limp it and only the thrill will we get it?
I'm an assassin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin of honies you see
Blasting at those who obye blasting at last at the weak!

Bring it raw, like the red, dead meat, in your plate
And I'll fill you up with the energy the Hill create
I gets sticky, like a green bag of the bomb diggy
Now I'm fucking with your head, and you realize that it's tricky
Got you paranoid, feeling the void, you can't take it
The reward being destroyed, freakazoid toy
With ya mind, all styles deployed, you find danger
In the stranger's eye, the killing comes second nature
Your battle filled up the mind it's falling out, hear you calling out
For help, and all the fucking yelling to is yourself
Crawling and begging for mercy means nothing when you bluffing
I'm pushing the button and straight dumping on fools fronting

""Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!""

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growing without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Ayo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinking and driving and swerving
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brushing a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowing a fucking smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinking up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I want to leave it alone
But never ever ever gotta worry from my home
What that funny sound knocking at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't want to buy no weed from no cop
Get knocked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growing my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growing like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!

Now lately I've been finding myself, pouring my guts out
Expressing my thoughts, letting my nuts out in the walls
Of sleep, I can't keep it all in the hall clear
While others keep it inside for the pride they hold dear
Should of been, would of been, could of been the cops
Stop look and listen, you'll get a vision of hip-hop
Individuals looking to the battle the shadows of man
See it all, be it all, you need a plan
It takes one man to understand this
Learn fucking with a deadly gas, you get burned
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Of living it's all given to you, don't lose it
Every man's given a tool, but don't use it

[Chorus]
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burning up see
The window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burning up see

[B-Real]
From the window of my room, the gloom spreading across
The land of milk and honey, no money to feed the boss
Funny the cost of life, cut clean blood streams
Out the body, nobody wants you dreaming about shorty
No longer don't need a 40 to take away any pain
So punk me and I'll give you the world exact change
Or quote me and you're never the same, I claim no one
I show none the weakness individuals go forth ya seek this
Wherever I roam is home to me
You Shogun, look at my enemies try to do me
The influential status, you know the baddest
Lookie here, show you what that is, bringing the madness
Sadness to those appealing to any conflict
Looking out my window pane, I see you falling
What are you a man or a mouse, the house light
Shining within, that's when you begin to live again

There it goes, the pride, you missed it
I ain't upset with the motherfucker dissing
Find me in Watts when you want to come hit me
Some shit ain't what it seems, in the land of dreams
Some sell their soul to get the cream
From the teens I don't sling or slang no crack
I'm known for bringing in funky ass raps
See those magazine crews and I'm a goner
Dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
Unlike some of these fools on the turf
Look like the real thing, but they soft like Nerfs
So unrehearsed that it shows in the product
Need to get the fuck out, before you get caught up

Cypress Hill,"Now this some bad weed
  
The very first time I hit the weed I was young
Coughing up a lung, high strung, back in '81
Going to school, hitting the Buddha behind the bleachers
Coming to class high, selling the lye to the teachers
Nickel bag, nickel bag, dime to a nickel
Selling joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle
Others wanted the 40 but I wanted the weed
While everybody was running out, I was planting my seeds
Homegrown, backyard boogie, I'm still stoned
Got my weed plants taller than your telephone's corner
I can remember when I could only get sess in those days
Now I'm rocking that chocolate Thai, skunk and the haze
Roll a fat one, pass it to the left don't front
But I hate it when they don't take the seeds out the blunt
A bunch of blunt-rollers are like rookies on the field
Spilling the weed plant fucking dookies with no skill
I should write a book, how to roll it then pass it
Light it, grow it, sell it and then divide it
Mr. Greenthumb, Dr. Weed, I proceed to give the herb man what they need
True indeed, blow your fucking smoke up in the sky
And get high with your bong or your Philly or dutchess give me a light
  
[Chorus]
Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to another
  
Get the weed sack, smoke it up, til it's all gone
No roaches up in the ashtray, smoke up all the bomb
I use to spend money but now I'm growing the crops
But I hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot
It was once said I smoke so much weed, by a brother
That I look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover
Maybe I use to look like that way back when
When my nigga Sen Dog was around sippin on the Hen
Let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk
We got the High Times cover shows you how to roll a blunt
Quarter pound, quarter pound, pound to a quarter
Making trips to Mexico running down to the border
Long hairs, bald heads, dreads and punk rocks
Kids of all colors be puffin it down the block
I got the weed on lock with all the hydro methods
Call me Puffy cause I making and taking a hit record
Blow your fucking smoke up in the sky and get high
With the bong, Philly or dutchess, give me the light

Had it all going on, but it didn't mean shit

And all the fame that came my way I gotta say
That she was all that, and a bag of indo
With no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Hey yo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
Bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran

So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
Or better yet like a fiend, who need a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., ""Tougher Than Leather""
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature

Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
But her sister's, banging too, what should I do?
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Planting my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playing the second string, on the squad
I'm blowing up, all in your face, word to God

[Barron Ricks]
Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
It made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fucking dick is throbbing
She started slobbing and goggling, spitting burbling burping it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
Between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
Was a motherfucking work of art, she rode my dick
Just like a Kawasaki til the pussy started sounding sloppy
Like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
On her face in between her lips
Then she started licking it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich, damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks

So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, feeling nobody's loss
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge to merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain

Think I'll get my dick sucked by this bass head bitch

Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all

So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about my abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt

No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
from the innocent man down, to the pedophile

Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside

And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fucking head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talking about is slanging and shooting off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the fuck out of the truck

Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game

Como un muÃ±eco, yo te controlo
Con las maÃ±as de maniaco
Mi ejercito crece como mota
La familia mas grande que la chota
Ahora te ecuentro en panico
Atrapado por mi clicka en el auto
Nunca encuentran cuerpos que tiramos
En lagos entierran evidencia why cae la miseria
Muy tarde llegan a buscarte a ti
Si me preguntan digo que yo no te vi
Un miedo vive en tu mente
Vente why deveras vas a conocer la muerte

[Chorus]
So you want to be a rock superstar? 
And live large 
A big house. Five cars, You're in charge. 
Comin' up in the world. 
Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror, dreaming about blowin' up 
The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys. 
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me.
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest 
And the games that be comin' with it 
Nevertheless, you got to go for the gusto 
But you don't know about the blood, sweat, and tears and 
Losin' some of your peers.

And losin' some of yourself to the years past, gone by 
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy 
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act 
Shit's deep 
48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal 
Think he's gonna make a mil but never will 
'Til he crosses over, still 
Fillin' your head with fantasies 
Come with me 
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's 

You want to be a rock superstar in the biz 
And take shit from people who don't know what it is 
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high 
And some can't pay the way 
Feel trapped in
What you rappin' about? 
Tell me what happened when you lost clout? 
The route you took started collapsing 
No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and
Everybody shits on your name. 

[Chorus: x2]

People see rock stars, you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out 
More like everybody else, you know, its a fun job, but its still a job. There's 
Gonna be another cat comin' out,
Looking like me, sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside 
Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.

You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream? 
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream 
You want to look trendy in the Bentley 
Be a star band, never act friendly. 
You want to have big fame 
Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains 
First they get played like all damn day 
Long as you sell everything will be ok 
Then you get dissed by the media and fans 
Things never stay the same way they began 
I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest 
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet 
Think everything's fine in the big time 
See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine 
So you roll far and live large 
It ain't all that goes with being a rock star

[Chorus: x2]

My own son don't know me 
I'm chillin' in a hotel room, lonely 
But I thank God I'm with my homies 
But sometimes I wish I was back home 
But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love 
They're phony 
Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony 
I'm in the middle like Monie 
And the press say that my own people disown me 
The best way back to keep your head straight 
Never inflate the cranium 
They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium 
Who just want to cling on, swing on, and so on 
Go on fall off - the ho's fall off 
To the next rock superstar with no shame 
Give him a year and they'll be right out the game 
The same as the last one who came before him 
Gained fame started getting' ignored 
I warned him 
Asured him this ain't easy 
Take it from the weazy 
Sleazy people want to be so cheesy 
They're fucking evil 
Assassins, assassins

You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid

Take advantage of the rilla, rob killa who scrapes

Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed

Throw you in the trunk take a ride to the Eastside

Duck from the gunshots that is sticking to ya
Standing all alone shotgun goes boo-ya
Watch it go through ya 
Ya smelling like manure
Fools all bloody body chilling in the sewer

Straight turn tricks for the fame and the money
Walk a little bold 'cause their record went gold
Got him a new ride and up rid it their ho
Need this looking raw before you come acting
Flexing on some brothers that is twelve times platinum

Sweep you and that bullshit under the doormat

Living on the Eastside fighting for survival
Gotta be nifty with the Han Solo and trying to show yo

Over little shit you do
Pretty hitting in me
What you done for me?
Robbery (Spanish)
Acting like it was my homie
Just a fucking phoney

A weakness so you can damage me
And discarnate me so you can take advantage (yeah)

The live it, you fucking gimmick
What you want -- disease?
For me and my homies
Niggaz want to act, damn
You don't even know me
What you need to breathe?
To think it over clearly
You can hear me over the speaker
It's best you don't come near me
What you got for me?
Back up and a lot of weight
But now, you hating on me
In every single way
What you have with me?

You get disconnected over methods you choose
To make yourself get ejected

What you need from me?
Someone to put your shit on
Never forget what I've done for you
Before you get on
What you have to be?
True to the family
And fuck 'em and feed 'em
If you ain't understanding me?
What you want to be?
Hard or a pop star
Going out and doing the same shit
That's a love song
What you want from me?
Nothing but burn riches now
I should snap your jaw
And knock it off the hinges
What you after me?
Doctors and nurses and hearses
And the worst thing you feeling
The blood curses
What you have to be?
Gone another memory
Remember this if I gotta choose over them or me
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand

Born for the big bank robbin your own

Cypress Hill,"Most people don't see how much work is really involved
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm saying
No matter what you just been through

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large a big house
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror dreaming about blowing up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be coming with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losing some of your peers
And losing some of your self
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees want to make a mill
But never will
Till he crosses over still
Feeling no hate
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You want to be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another be	-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And motherfucking get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sitting up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
'cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the palladium
Who just want to cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started getting ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people want to be cheesey
They talking evil

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house

Now I'm heading to the Eastside looking for revival
Living on the Eastside fighting for survival

Gotta be nifty with the Han Solo and trying to show no
Wittinesses 'cause people will use it to kill your show yo
Off to the stone garden you go and stay there
When I'm dead I'm bringing my music to play there

For all the soldiers, money folders, you're on my shoulders
You can't hold us back I'm spitting out boulders
Crushing every opponent in opposition
I know you're wishing that I would bow to submission

Eastside L.A., Cypress Hill all day
Spark the lah, we live this shit

And spark the lah, we live this shit

Smash you with the switches 
The hitch is, you're getting too big for your britches 
Why you running like bitches 
With your tail up, I'm the thug pirate
Put the sail up, your whole crew frail, what 
You want this joint, suck it inhale nut 
Niggas are feelin' this track in Braille, huh 
We're grade A while you motherfuckers fail, what 
You understand, imitators gotta bail up 
To all the males and females gangin' up 
All on my cell phone talkin' shit, hangin' up

My high lyrics constantly brain damagin' 
Brandishin' a fire arm, still managin' 
Hurt niggas, bandagin' who give my lyrics 
That play like a mandalin 
I hold my mic like my dick, but you handlin' 
I kill flows on tracks who abandonin' 
I eat you like pussy, then take a sample, 
Then spit fire in the places you standin' in 
I take a fool to the Hill 
Light a candle then you in the dark stuck part in the scandalin' 
Now I see your whole brain's scramblin' 
Don't like what you hear, change the channel then nigga

Stolen shit, rolling it, Cypress ownin' it

Suck it hard swallow easy, put a soul in it 
Your body's on the floor, head got a hole in it 
The weed master, rhyme killer, mic controllin' it 
You still fuckin' but your wack, ain't throwin' it 
Stepped in shit, now your chillin' all alone in it

You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquette

At the club, and they don't want to share theirs
Can I get a hit of your weed [Repeats]

[B-Real]
You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they want to be up in the party
Laughing and giggling, sipping on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talking about you want to hit, spitting in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinking about these fucking jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they sucking a dick, fuckers
Flipping it, loving it, smoking it to the head
Giving it to me half way down, ""thanks again""
Then when you see 'em later smoking they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, ""sorry this is my last""
I shared some with you, ""Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you want to buy some""
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothing's worse when someone's asking for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bol
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
'cause the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it

And that's just the way it is man
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn
You just can't come, asking for some shit and not giving none in return
What the fuck is that man? We going into 2000 motherfucker
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people

Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at impressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I won't run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away
 
[Chorus] 
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die 
(we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
 
I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you 
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

Teenage gangsters with something to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just, having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

[Sen Dog]
I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that 
Flavor of the month, bro, ? try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

[Chorus: x2]
Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You want to party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""
'cause we take away ya stress and never settle for less

[B-Real]
When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'cause I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

[Chorus: x2]

""Say what?""

[Sen Dog]
Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (Cypress!)
want to see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

[Chorus: x2]",Amplified,2001
Cypress Hill,"[B-Real]
I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
For the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
It's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
Some of us out, he used to think we were invincible
On the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

[Chorus]
Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand

[B-Real]
So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
They turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
Walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
Don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
Then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown

[Chorus]",Bitter,2001
Cypress Hill,"[B-Real]
I slay punks who don't know their own identity
You spit my name and use it like an obscenity
You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don't mean shit to me and you ain't got a clue
Of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
Cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather

[Chorus]
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: ""You ain't shit to me""
Without you takin' it personally

[Sen Dog]
Ten, proper years of bringin' funk
I, still count mine, it's hella gettin' over the hump
I got the loads on the skull, I got my hand on the pump
Still got the boss to go nutty on you punks (yeah!)
I don't want to be the King of the Sing
Just a Soul Assassin for the Cypress Team
I rhyme and sing and make bitches scream
They love that old South Side gangsta lean
Call the Psycobeta, I guess you're crackin'
Turn into Mad Dog when I start rappin'
Look at hostile - ah, damn wild
Shake you up in a hurry from the voodoo child
Don't get caught up hangin' on the mortar
Hold on and I'll turn y'all punks all wild

I'm tired of whack rappers and fame seekers
Like you know the deal to be in my same sneakers
I don't mind exposin' you hollow bitches
I got the medicine over the swallow bitches
You play roles like an actor but get no oscar
Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you're in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That's when you get introduced to the street sweeper

I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People tryin' to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cause it's a  Chronicle 
My life, I realize I'm responsible for obstacles 
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame 
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay 
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay 
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'cause you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone

Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more

Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect 
Now, what's ? all with this year 2000's?  
We putting the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
Not many have lasted

Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean
""Damn"", you defy, when you live or die

Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?

You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage 
Not that many can deal with the fury

'91 ('91) Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feelin' Kill A Man (Kill A Man)
That was about the time we was openin' up for Naughty
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party

'92 ('92) a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs and Sen
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP

'93 ('93) Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it in rap music
But it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin' paid and I stopped smokin' stress

[Chorus]

'94 ('94) still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage

'95 ('95) I was alive and survived so far
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a rap star
'Cause that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusin'(I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (Yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution

'96 ('96) wit' no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every click, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
'97 ('97) was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms

'98 ('98) was kinda great, 'cause it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cause it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again

'99 ('99) I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate

Two-thousand (Two-thousand) 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish

Two-thousand and one (Two-thousand and one) 
Goddamn, who knows what's in store
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated

Psychedelic visions would ensue
My view feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I ?, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
'cause you lack style, and you need all the help brother
'cause you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:

Yo yo yo, all my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It aint no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!

[Chorus: B-Real]
We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high

[Method Man]
Yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like Simmy Colan
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
Take the back seat and smash beats
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off

They feel it in they heart: I was there to test things
Didn't arrest aim, the bullet-proof vest came
These niggas shoot first, then askin' check names
It's less strain 
It's all real; I bet fame; it's a chess game
Wrong move and it's checkmate (That's right) 
I might sound funny out here 
But, really, niggas get money out here 
And, hey, everyday is sunny out here
So listen, don't play dummy out here

Gettin' trampled, dumped on, and thumped on
Scraped on the six-five with the hand on the pump song

It's been a while now
Been around the block many miles 
Many faces, many places 
That I found ?friend's? traces
Where I spend time, places where my roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just want to be alone
When I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down
'cause they never have their own
They won't get the best of me
But they try hopelessly 
Why you want to fuck wit' me?
I'm not, what you s'posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawed off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself 
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, 
Trouble always found me, 
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide,
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come INSIDE!

No, TROUBLE'S NOT MY goal!
You want trouble, c'mon, 
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon

Trouble on the line, all the fuckin' time
Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don't really matter  
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in the Cypress Hill pen
Like the critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn 
I try to put it to you ? so you bitches can learn 
That no-body get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin' that some shit is cool 
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself 
Put in all on the line make sure that I'M FELT!

No!

Look, the wall's closin' in 
and my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown that you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me ""Rock Superstar"", ""Insane In The Brain""
But I know I haven't changed
So I brush you to the side 
Trouble's knockin' on the door, askin' jus' to come inside
Times I gotta block it out, no-one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't want to have to talk
If you're feelin (?), son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your (?)

The shit weighs out in a month, the loss goes on timeless
Ya rolled into crimeless, aggravated and shineless

Stop actin' like an infant, I'm tired of force feedin' you

Start to realize what the fuck in speech is scary

Go for broke cause if ya lose control ya end up in the hospital
Incomprehensible, unconventional, go go go

Cypress Hill,"So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid
Growin' up, lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds make money chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me, shits funny

How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers and losin' some of your self

Music has past gone by hopefully you don't manifest
For the wrong guy Egomaniac, in the Brainiac
Don't know how to act, shits deep
Forty eight tracks studio gangsta mack

Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will till he crosses over still
Feelin' no hate but fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin' cheese

You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play

Trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect
No change, no women, and everyone shits on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know just signed your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off

They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone 'n' Noreaga
And they'll find another B Real
So you need to just keep stack your chips up

Do what you gotta do while you hot?
And mafuckin' get out the game
This isn't the drug game
It's even worse

Because in the drug game
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sittin' up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home

But only no radio or videos
'Cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony

I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back

Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on

And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year

And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame started gettin' ignored

I warned him, assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They're fuckin' evil

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged

Life style got wild, similar to rock singer
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dream

Fools need to get back, I ain't really with that
Flavor of the month, programmers try to dispatch
Always got the good batch, take it to the head
Got you wasted like Jerry from the 'Grateful dead'

Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down and stripped butt naked
I just kicked the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time that you hear it

'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside

You wanna party with the best say, the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

When you chill with the hill, keep your mouth sealed
If you rely on your skill, then rely on your steal
If you have no ideal or any thoughts to bill
What you sought was real to give 'em slots to fill

Busters stop and yield but I'll daze them
Quicker than takin' a box of pills, now you gots to chill
Get cops and shields, steady, hawk the fields
And they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill

As I lock the will don't you mock the drill
'Cause I'll cock my steal and make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you top the deal
Quit talkin' nil, you won't top my will, bitch

Wanna see a dog show put your money on my set
Real MC's and real DJ's, real Southsiders from the heart of L.A.

Now back in the days we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can't beat the LP from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin' without a hit single

Time to get locin', put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage and start up a commotion
No, I ain't jokin', see my mic smokin'
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken
Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken

Audio thumpin' and head bumpin'
Motherfuckers want to hear somethin', CD's jumpin'
Thumpin' the ground all of a sudden
In the mist of the smoke I shut it - all competition
Set the condition to submission
From the contact I'm sparkin' at brain cells
through songs and magazines and through the e-mail
I'm worldwide, six side, killafornia highs
No time, define, no wolfs, we need the blind

Yup.

My first mission runnin' through the head to smoke jack
With memories poppin' in my head recall that

Late night creepin' through the alley with six deuce
Strapped up everybody focused no mixed views

A sawed off pumped in my hand with two shells
The other four holmies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga lookin' for popos and foes hell
Someone lookin' through windows the door bells

Goes off followed by the punk you gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up still I remain calm

House lit up you could see it for eight blocks
Runnin' through the hood run in front of the fade cops

The game chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
Rolled out ran into the spot to meet up

Strapped down covered up the tracks and back home
Laid low earned me a stripe perfect no

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Soot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the hip-hop
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the gunshots

Yeah I'll hit your block up better lock up
Fuck the gang and shit don't stop uh

A mad dog with a bob in the reagle
Go into mode and just kill all your people
Coast to coast ain't a nigga more evil
Now made me act a lot and call Sen Diesel

Rock the block with the M one six
.44 mag like a east war fit
This here granadilla break you off right quick
Be prayin' up to Jesus and all that shit

Uh niggas be jackin' when they see my bucket
Roll down they block they hide and say fuck it

Come back in form of an assassin
Three hundred yards with the infrared action

Troop is the layer black Doc Holiday
Cuancho raider the modern day huh

Yeah, now shooting up your town. Them bad ass assassins, boy. Thought you knew. Check this out, you better be packin', fool. Hyeah.

I manned all missions when I was a youth so thoughtless
G ride no fingerprints it's spotless
Six bows hittin' all the Gs and we got this
Rag top down like a stripper that's topless

See me hittin' the corner you meltdown
Slugs fly thugs die moment ya fell down
Somebody's screamin' you hangin' the hell down
I'm certified nigga when you're sittin' there spellbound
No thoughts barkin' just hearin' the hellhounds
Burn you with the heaters spittin' out twelve rounds

It's life in the hood no escapin' the gunplay
Buy one day I'm out gotta figure out some way
Rats in the park all scatter when guns spray
Got you locked in now where do the slugs stray
I found ways out but the street be one way
Got a dark mind no thoughts blacker than Sunday

Cypress Hill,"[B-Real]
Well here's a little story, I got to tell
About a thugged out homey, I know so well
It started way back, when I was a teen
In the hood, on the corner, slangin dope to fiends
Had the little stash that could serve your need
You can do what you want but I got weed for me
Ridin for my fam, tryin to hit a grand
CRASH unit on my ass, now I'm in demand
One lone-ly fami-ly I be
All in the hood, I got no-bo-dy
The sun is beatin down on my red dark hat
Pigs are roamin through the alley so I gotta toss my gat
Forgot about the sack, lookin for a place to hide
If they ask me for my name - fuck 'em, I'ma lie!""

[Chorus]
One O.G. gangsta I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangsta stash
When they caught me with the weed, and the dope and hash

[B-Real]
He said a little something, I wasn't so impressed
No more running homey, now you're under arrest
The sack was in my hand, felt like a sack of bricks
I swore he couldn't see it when I threw it in my whip
He said he wanted some, I said I don't have none
Found it in the sun on the floor next to my gun
Next thing I saw was the gun to my head
Now the lead will make me dead, and yo this is what he said

[Sen Dog]
My name is Sgt. Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yea)
Now what do we have here? A banger and his peers

[B-Real]
He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears
Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin
You think the story's over but it's ready to begin

[Chorus]

[Sen Dog]
Now I got your crack and most of your crew
You got a couple choices of what you can do
Better make the right decision if you know what I mean
You can do some time, or fork over your green

[B-Real]
I said I got no green he started looking at me harder
I said I don't have nothing you can go fuck your daughter (WHAT?)
He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat
He put the night stick to my back, so
I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun
It isn't looking good, I got ink on my thumb
Another pig walked in, said he's playin games
He gave another look at me, found out my false name

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
Sitting there pissed as I dwell in my cell
The place smells like shit, in the County Jail
Homey looking at me like he seen me before
He started throwing up a set, then he spit on the floor
I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid
It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib
This dude said, get ready, pulled a shank on me
I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy
Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye
The guards yelled, ""Give it up!"" and let two fly
The guards said down and we hit the floor
If you make a move after you won't move no more
He said I think you once again best protect ya neck
I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect
I said you want to come with it, any time and place
And I'll leave you like Pacino with a Scar-on-ya-face
They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped
But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped
P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load
I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed

They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch

Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work

I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, don't be a hater son

Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your a** up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying n****

You ain't a player hust a frail n****
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street

Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix

Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

Legendary criminal destined to be professional

Ever since my days you rock vest just to push your range
No doubt about it

Read up in your magazine just to see what were about

Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black a** n**** flow over the piano
Droppin it good
For that hoody in the front row

that's my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherf***er rattle

Either man rush I'm gonna hit em with the head rush
So be careful on what you trusting

I was walking on the block
Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg

And I know who did it
They gonna get it

Bounced upstairs and got strapped up

I love that drama s***
I'm all ga**ed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul s*** I did

I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay

Ran up on homes
And blast away
He pa**ed away twin got the last laugh today

Shit it never easy, homie people will connive
Better have a hustle if you mean to survive
Why you're so greedy, can you tell us all why
Look homie believe me, you're fuckin' metal ply
For the Dollar everybody is a target that's real
Talkin' is smog you're fate's signed and sealed
You could be the next one cross 'em in the path
What maybe if you do the math you can avoid the blood bath
All the Money that we stole too weak to take greed

Was it drugs or your lady
We had good times
Committin' hood crimes
We drew lines
But you never understood mine
You don't go fucking homies
Just like my momma told me
I held my hood up only
You were a fucking phony
I guess it manifested when I got the call early
They said you bunkered down in the hood with old girly
She had your back covered but that didn't matter did it
I know you're livid but you put your fucking self in it
Don't try to make a move nigga don't go fucking dare
I know you're hurting cause you're tied up to the fucking chair
You never loved your family
You robbed them all gladly
They tried to love you sadly
You let 'em down badly
Just call me death angel
But we were never strangers
You bout to get mangled

Now it's time to pay
Any last word to say?
I know your minds strayed
Son, I think you need to pray
Don't even need to tell you,
You were a smart nigga
Save your teardrops,
Yo don't even start nigga
Ya should of thought a that long ago before ya fucked me
Ya dodged long enough homie now ya been lucky
But now it's pay the piper
No fucking traps or snipers
Just a gas a lighter
Caught up in the web of spiders
And now you get devoured
Burned up in the flames you coward
This is the fairy hour
I sent your family flowers
I'm sure they all will miss you
But they will be good without you
They'll reminisce and light a candle
When they talk about you

Give you a light

Gone where some of y'all niggas, couldn't come back

Came back with a hard shell and hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all

Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge
Much closer to death, every step I kept on

Ill have you jumping fences
And running down the treat like a track star
I'm at the finish line, its essential
We so influential
Well strip you of your street credential
Game recognize, game we all about
Think you can diminish mine
Look homey I got a career

[Chorus: x2]

They call me dog homey
Look I don't sell woof tickets
I got my fingers on the trigger
And I'm ready to click it
I never back down
there's nothing you cand do to me nigga
Who the fuck are you
Your face is really new to me nigga
You want to run with the dog
Try paying your dues homes
Bum nigga yelling every time that I use chrome
So many niggas, ain't none of them blast, the right lights
In the woods be stunning their ass
I took a chance
To advance, in my life believe it
It takes a stand to be a man
Plus the gang conceited
Fools trying to be hard
They only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, Ill smack you hoes
Try to fool people
Make em think you something your not
I'm exposing all you bitches
By provoking the crowd
Raw dogging, dying for some action, drama
Your bitch shocked out
Bullets through plastic dome

[Chorus: x2]",Till Death Comes,2004
Cypress Hill,"How many times have we been through this
I can tell you that it's getting harder every time I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
Helped my feet moving on the ground
No matter what situation occasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep dough up blazing 
I kept you by me, but when we separated I was thinkin' foolishly
Remember when your Ex-Boy tried to bug on me
I told to bring it on and I'll buy you a slug on me
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song

[Chorus]
Till Death Do Us Part
I do
Till Death Do Us Part
I do

Who would have thought it would last so long
So many new ones think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you caught me outta line
If you thought I didn't respect it, I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got on my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Maybe think about my life where I'm going a little tricky ? Huh?
I know there were time where you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on some
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some have tried to steal you all, I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, 'cause the truth will free you but don't get mad
When truth is leaving I'm only telling you 'cause I got your back

[Chorus]

You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it
When I trip not too many who can put with it
But you still there, still care so well, oh yeah
Got so much love when you need you can go there
I appreciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour, I go on, we could make it up like never before
You want all the little things that make it work it
Why not, we can get it, we both deserve it
It's hard but nothing's good, it's ever so easy
We have a bond that won't break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me through when I'm in the dark
They said we'd never last but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song, c'mon

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't. 
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits.
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips,
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every ni-
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain, 
She gave no play, tend to offer numbers and she said no way.
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me. 
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. 
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I 
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my 
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name

[Chorus: x2]
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation? 
The night is young, Girl 
Give me a chance

She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while 
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her 
A drink she turned me down flat she said ""If you want my name 
You gotta do better than that."" I said, ""Okay, now your shit 
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink."" 
As I began to walk away she said ""I'm sorry for reals, but every 
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each 
And everyone would lie to you"" I said ""I understand but that's 
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but 
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I 
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want."" 
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
[Chorus: x2]

Lets go!

She said I want a man with the plan and ambition not an immature,
On a., get mission. I'm too good but that I have so much to offer.
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. ""You got 
Goals?"" that's what she asked, ""Yeah, I want to fill my home with 
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming 
After."" She said ""Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper"". ""I do 
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love 
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough 
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk  on the street? 
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get 
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends 'til 
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz.

Comin' out the slums! It's da hoodlums
I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bums
So bring it on when you want to come fight this
Outlaw, kicking like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
Chill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you want to get drastic
I'll pull out my plastic glock, automatic
Synthetic material, burial plots in order
Headed down to the Mexican border
Smokin' that smellie, Northern Cali
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum, hear the gat come, boom!

Erratic, .45 automatic
Screamin' at ya, the red lights beamin' at ya

Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under, don't make Stevie Wonder why
Cause he'll testify

I got you thinkin' ""What the fuck is this?"" 
Lettin' you know I take care of business
Can, I, get a witness?
To verify when I depict this style
That makes you ecstatic
Tragic, when I get a poof of the magic buddha
When I roll with my crew
I betcha one time can't find my hootah
In my vehicle with the belt unbuckled
Pig rollin' up but he ain't that subtle
Pulled to da curb, so we exchange a few words
But he got me stirred up, enough to grab the handcuffs
I'll huff-n-puff and blow ya head off!

But don't be fooled
They say it never rains
I can tell you that ain't true
'Cause when you hustle on the streets
So that you can feed your family
Depending on what you hustle
Niggas could just kill a man

The game of life
I'm a full-time player
Never settle for less
I keep searching for what's greater
Inspite of any hater portrayal
I keep it moving
Never fucked anyone over
Because it comes back later

At the dump it's a long fall
When you the bottom
People remember
All the attitudes you shot 'em
The minute you fall
You're as good as forgotten
Thought you had it all
But it all went rotten

But no many times I have failed
I've never let anything get in the way
Of my dreams and hot spells

I stay focused
With my mind on the prize
And if you try to block me
Then we push you aside

Easy they go when yo' shit gets old

This business ain't nothing
But a series of comebacks
Write you off as dead
Til you come back with a bomb track

Man you got to save food
?
Nothin' all over your stuff
That's right
I believe in myself and my talent
Skills have been diminished
Motherfucker, there you have it
You got to learn the game
Master every angle
Like a zen master runnin' the triangle
Just when they think that you're all dried up
Surprised that they asked when the back don't cut

I'll tell you what it takes
Patience, persistence, perseverance

Know it in your song
They gon' love it when they hear it

Nobody's taking me out
I'll decide
When I'm outta here

[Chorus]

I got love for every fan
Ever part of the plan
So while you can
Take some pictures
And sign some autographs 

But if you push I put my foot in your ass

Not many in this game would last so long
So they can get what they can
Before the time is done
People are gonna stay with you
But you must never mislead them
But if you treat them wrong
Lead them on
They'll say ""We don't need you""
Then it's back to the streets, to square one
Nigga screaming, ""This ain't fair""
Yeah
But nobody cares
You had the money and the cars
Big house and pearls
Jewels and hot beats
So that you could spit out words

So much time and emotion invested
From being on top
Nigga, can't get arrested
Easy come, easy go
When they forget 
In every regard

Cypress Hill,"Featuring Eminem and B Real

[ Eminem ]
WAAAHHHOOOOOO , hahaha (laughs)
guess who's back !?
mommy , we're home
say hello to my little friends , DJ Muggs , Soul Assassins , Cypress Hill
everybody , put your hands where my eyes can see

[ Eminem ]
everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck , forty fifty Samoans , they knowin´ when D-Bo was
50 , Tweezy , Obie there won't be no hoe in us , they pop shit like they gon´ do shit but no one does
from New York down to Texas , back up to Los Angeles , we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up gettin´ rushed by too many to handle us , it's funny I guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched , it's not like we're just feelin´ ourselves that much
it's just , that if someone ever does put us in the clutch , we just know that y'all ain't gon´ be the one who's gon´ do it
cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that , you fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in , we ain't even gon´ be in it , no one's gonna hear nothin , no one's gonna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it , them boys is bout it , bout it , the noise from (???) be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be layin´ on the ground gettin´ trampled by people dancin´ , till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened , nobody saw it happen , all cause your jaws are flappin´
and you couldn't stop yappin´ and took it past rappin´ , it ain't about the music no more , it's about tryin´ to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off

[Chorus - Eminem]
shit's about to change , cause we ain't playin´ no games
we ain't budgin´ neither are they , we ain't sayin´ no names
shit just ain't the same , when the K's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop , cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryin rip shots , to get props no more
it's about tryin´ not to get popped , and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911

[B-Real]
step off my holster cause shit it's gettin´ serious , all these drugs you be fuckin´ with make you delirious
thinkin´ you coming with heat , yo son I'm curious , how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us ?
some people can never fade us , that make us so furious , mistake us for fakers , homie we great but glorious
we livin´ for real and others just makin´ the stories up , allusions are broken , so live it up , you corny fucks
if you take a fuckin´ minute to think about what you've done , when you stood against the gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one , sprayin´ you bitches till there is none , i'm like a rolling stone homie , I got you under my thumb
you silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches , we cut you and give you stitches , for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget , you're clockin´ a small digit , dealin´ with the Giant Goliath , people that's how we live it , c'mon

[Chorus]

[Ganxsta Ridd]
uh , gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit , on this shit you call hip hop , this function is where did it
when I put it in motion , my focus is gettin´ branded , my appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
got you stumblin´ for cover , this music dyin´ in numbers , but you wouldn't pause and wonder , admittin it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinkin´ you runnin shit , you witness that funny shit , your bitches they ain't shit
we gangstas we blast first , ask questions later , all these imitators parading like they some playaz
tryin´ to save hip hop the task is somethin greater , cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught , I'm not tellin´ , or more like killin´ not caring , i'm ridin´ a gangsta feelin´ , no fearing when gangstas dyin´
I'm in a full circle with homies that supposed to bleed , on an 8 mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

[Chorus]",911,2006
Cypress Hill,"Zippedy do da, zippedy hey
Cried oh my, wanna get that punk with my AK
And get on the way
On a mission, puffin' on a fat as* jay
Prude! You can't hang
Flash back on the skills when I used to bang
On the corner
I'll warn ya
Gonna roll on ya
Fool
Hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden
Blastin' at these fools with a passion
Look at the Glock when it's time for some action

Let the gatt hum
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hum

Let the gatt hum
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hum

Sunday morning
Wake up it's stormin'
Raindrops fallin' on my head it's pourin'
Cats an' dogs
Pigs in a wagon
Lookin' for the Afro - one that's saggin'
Scooby-Doo
An' fucked down too
Ploy me
Don't let your punk as* try me
Gonna take more
Then you better call your backup team
And wait for the crew
I'm the one flippin'
Keepin' the clip
On my hip an'
Just watch your back if you're slippin'
Ooh
Where did that .22
Come from
When the bullet past through my lung
I've lost my breath I'm winded
I've been hit, by a slug that wasn't intended
I hear thunder
I wonder
If a nigga like me's goin' under
Take a number!

Let the gat hum
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hum

Let the gat hum
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hum

Had a bad dream
Woke up in a casket
Now I can't even get back at the bastard
Bull-shit!
This pine box
Ain't strong enough to contain the Afro Marx
Critical bell rings
Snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam
Pointin' at me
I got no strap G
What now: gotta duck, they're gonna gatt me
Bam, I feel numb
Where did the shotgun blast come from

Let the gat hum
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hum

Let the gat hum
Lick a shot
So I let the gat hum",Like a Shot,2008

And I set out from the beginning, to kick on the scratch
Using modern technique, I place a beat in a rap
I went to learn acquire knowledge of a scholar went to college, all
Comes very handy when it comes to pushin', shovin' and stuff
Then ask who is he though, I'm not a sissy
I'm stiff the neutral brother, and I'm born to get busy

Whole lotta gattin' 
With the loc'ed out latin

Better talk quick 'cause ya might get dusted

Yes I know that you can't withstand it 
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it 
With a steel-toe, how you feel now 
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo 
Cry on a pillow, weeper that's willow

Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hard to console tonight, feeling nobody's lost
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, I paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law

Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin news hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick sucked by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all sucked, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers

So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Look into the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
Watch this, a dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out ""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the fuck out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the fuckin' floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny? Get that smile off your face

In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game runnin' for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sittin' on top is the Hill lookin' over you

Killa Hill N****s, cream in my dream
Cookin' up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a f*** who it is

Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleepin' with the fishes

Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be comin' to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-you n****z talkin' fast like Puerto Ricans

What you seekin', son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speakin', wild as Indians
Tomahawk - Shaolin slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?

I'm, a weak seed, no, I'm the humble weed
Not feed to chewin' it , this spliff this tweed
Actin type of stylin', how do you spell it
Take a hit from outta New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, so the smoke can let out

Ahhh, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another!

Put me in the bamboo, with just the tape deck
There go white brother, rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
(Yeah man) Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off, the hype or croak off
When you blow the smoke off, hold until I get off
Or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm, the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another

Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another

You wanna feel the effects of the high?
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?

He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley

This pig is known as a Narco
If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be
This pig he's a fuckin' fag
So all his homepigs they call him a pussy

Well this pig he's really cool
So in this class we know he rides all alone
Well this pig's steady eatin' donuts
While some motherfuckers out robbin' your home

This pig he's a big punk
And I know that he can't stand the sight of me
'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart
And when ya tell 'em that your a group from society

This pig works for the mafia
Makin' some money off crack
But this little pig got caught
So when he gets to the Pen it's all about the pay-back

'Cause once he gets to the Pen
They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest
To protect him from some mad nigga
Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest
 
And it's all about breakin' off sausage
Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?
Niggas want to do him in the ass
Just to pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)

I used to know this girl that slanged the green shit
Had it all goin on, but it didn't mean shit
She wanted to be a star, with big cars
And all the fame that came my way I gotta say
That she was all that, and a bag of indo
With no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Aiyyo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
Bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran
Had all the holy books, and notes to get still
I never met another dealer with that appeal
With those electric eyes, hypnotized
Any wise man surprised, the queen of the lye

[Barron Ricks]
Bee eyes, bouncin five deep, clicked of innocence
Hangin with friends, all under surveillance from the government
While Don want tights they floss rights, just chewin on ice
Meditatin with her camp, gettin damp
She's a pimp or tile freak bitch, high maintenance
She got her fuckin clit pierced, chained to her anus
Professional for wettin niggaz up, suck em first
Til they bust, swallow nut, then she's quick to strut
Right out the projects, been a whore since ninety-one
Suck a niggaz dick for fun, holdin guns in her buns
Type of chick tell you 'fuck me in the ass' talkin shit
While she goin WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA on your dick

No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

Yeah since I seen the queen of green on the screen
So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
Or better yet like a fiend, who need a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., _Tougher Than Leather_
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature
SkyPager turned off, datin one of the Lakers
Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
But her sister's, bangin too, what should I do?
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Plantin my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playin the second string, on the squad
I'm blowin up, all in your face, word to God

[Barron Ricks]
Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
It made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fuckin dick is throbbin
She started slobbin and gogglin, spittin burblin burpin it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
Between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
Was a motherfuckin work of art, she rode my dick
Just like a Kawasaki til the pussy started soundin sloppy
Like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
On her face in between her lips
Then she started lickin it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich.. damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks

A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty 
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey

Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run!

You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride

If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep

My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks 
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

Take the back seat and smash beats 
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You want to be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cause you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten 
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You want to roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You want to test with the sess, well first off

Climbing the billboards for the number one spot

Look and learn and loose your top

Pocket's swollen
We're locked and loaded

I'm the king in this area hombre
Knocked em out the park when I'm standing on home plate

So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without me the dogs stay switching the gears
I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still getting luck from Africa to L.A.
Tape one hit play
Burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to say
'Cause they stay loyal so it's harder to go
And like the lights I got's to grow
That means I'll roll but I'll return later
Give props to my and buckshot's to haters

Hip hop culture we fuck you both
Just as you caught in the rapture
All I hear is laughter
In a year's time some of you punks won't matter
Let's see if you can hang if you can climb the ladder
You're not a rapper you're a fucking joke
A one-track hack on a track get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
Come hard for the paint and I'm blocking you out
So run for the hills and hide in the can
Just put the mic down 
And be that fan
With your petty hands outside the lobby
I'm a pro get my signature
This ain't no hobby

We live hard still armed and dangerous
We young love be alarmed, don't play with us
Play this song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along hit the bong and blaze with us

You know the first time I fuckin' blazed up, eh
I was listenin' to those vatos Cypress Hill
You ever heard of them, homes?

Yeah, I heard of them
They fuckin' suck

Are you fuckin' stupid, eh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Those vatos are firrme, homes
You're a fuckin' hater, eh
Those vatos will shoot you, homes

Whatever

This is for all those haters and imitators
Take your medicine; you won't like the flavor
The taste ain't sweet; we lace that beat
Never forget how we play in the street
Never forget what you say in the street
If you talk too loud, get laid with the heat
We want that cake and, Jay, you can't stop us
Out the gate we take those dollars
Get a crew while we doin' some real shit
Me and the Dog steady pushin' the Hill shit
We flip scripts like doughboys flip bricks
Get money like lottery quick picks
We sick wit' it and, homey, I'm quick-witted
Still in the game, insane, we still spit it
Top level, livin' like a rebel
Settle down, bitch, or we spit that metal

Remember when you motherfuckers
Tried to take what's mine
Niggas left me for dead
But I'll never forget it

I came up in the game, do my thing for the paper
Never gonna change, biggie-bang on them haters
They used to gang bang on a (?)
Dropped Insane; now the world's (?)
I remember when you niggas used to front on me
Everywhere I'd ride, I kept a gun on me
I only used to listen to my one ol' G
He said get money, but stay low-key
So it's the payback 'cause I pay it in the back
Whole world get high when I say it on a track
And I stay wit' a gat; I'm never gonna slip
Quick to hit him up if you ever wanna trip
All it takes is a hit and you never gon' forget
When you smoke on the Hill with the kill that we twist
Fuck a shot--we drinkin' a whole fifth
And I ride 'em (?); you know we gon' miss",Bang Bang,2010
Cypress Hill,"I was an outcast, outsider
Trouble-maker
A lost soul, outta control
In danger
Didn't have a care in the world
My feelings were numb
Never showing emotion
Is easy for some
I don't know how it happened
How I got to this point
But I needed a way out
I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck
My head was so fucked
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing
I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin'
With a chip on my shoulder
An insane, hit the brain
Certified street soldier
So close to the grave
You at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

[Chorus]
Oh, the sky overhead
Is like a canvas of gray
I dunno how much time
I'm beginnin' to save
From the first spring to light
To the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life
Till they come carry me away

I've been there in LA nights
In the block where I came up
My pops used to hate
When we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
Fight, don't run
Is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground
And stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars, and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen
None of 'em there
That's when I figured out
That nobody cared
If we lived or die
We'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time

[Chorus]

My mother would stand for me
Every step of the way
She did not judge me
She told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest
When I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter
Said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me
I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for doe
So many nights I didn't come home
She thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down
Without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well, I regret all those times that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down
I wish I could take it all back
And make it better, but I can't
So I try to make amends
And be there, through thick and thin

[Chorus]

Come carry me away

Back from the dead, a resurrection

Where the kush blows free and the low-lows drop
It's a photo-op, no flash, we smash, get cash
Dash out the fuckin' spot

So off the chain, no complication

No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the kush
When I harvest, put a K on the bag like the Nike swoosh

Cypress Hill,"It's been a while now, been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places, that I found friend's traces
Where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home, places I can get stoned

I just wanna be alone, when I'm feelin' in my zone
People wanna knock me down, 'cuz they never have their own
They won't get the best of me, but they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me? I'm not, what you s'posed to be

You did not give a damn, coulda just killed a man
Sawed off in my hand, but I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind, feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself

It all goes around me, and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, trouble always found me
I know I used to welcome it, with my arms open wide
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come inside

Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me, but it don't really matter
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggaz run and scatter

Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in the Cypress Hill pen
Like the critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn

I try to put it to you bluntly, so you bitches can learn
That nobody get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there, a lot of you have been fooled
Into actually believin', that some shit is cool

Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit, from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line, make sure that I'm felt

Called me, Rock Superstar, Insane In The Brain

But I know I haven't changed, so I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, anxious jus' to come inside
Times I gotta block it out, no one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' in and I can't seem to lock it out

Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin' froggy son, then I guess you gotta jump

I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognize

Cypress Hill,"I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites,
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life,
I'm under pressure but the time is right,
For me to look inside of myself, the time passes by every night,
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise,
And my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes,
Quad and tea, the streets filled with death and lies,
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise,
So when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected,
Some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it,
I gotta believe, in more than I see,in something better than this, whatever it is,
I need a quate before my feeling is gone,
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But ill embrace it like a beautiful song,
I feel something strong coming along,
I cant explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone.

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred,
The feeling is saw like I'm getting a message from god,
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws,
The reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost,
I'm searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity,
I'd vanity my home is a warzone calamity, randomly,
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life,
I'd give in a minute the Vicapri is from stripe,
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us,
When the day comes and we rise the high of our faith,
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers,
Now the bees inside of my head, the life that I lead,
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread,
I blade so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

I gotta new thought in my mind, in a matter of time,
Ill be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind,
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside,
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie,
If the celebration continues Ill follow my heart,
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart.
Its fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise.
So I'ma have to make a difference to remember I tried,
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night,
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet,
No words need to be said as my patters begun, cause
Nothing can break the chain of a father and son,
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies,
Tryin' to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties,
Rollin in a club god damn these people are young,
But needs to be done so Ill reach you over the hoe.

Switchin' lanes back and forth, poppin' strains of Indo
We ridin' high
Foot on the gas, car full and we smoke
Ridin' high
Laid back, smooth, it'll put you in the mood
We ridin' high
We're the Kings of the Chronic and this is how we do

D-Loc:
When I bounce out, I got a pocket full of weed
Pants always sagged, Double Dash burnin' trees
??? Can't understand the next line ???
Stop at the liquor store to get a little somethin'
Pick a 12 pack up, a couple of blunts
Go back to the crib, now it's time to get drunk
Call my girl up, 'cause I need a lil' love
Roll another blunt, let the smoke float above

On a Sunday afternoon, just washin' my car
Gettin' it ready for the night and the boulevard
Polishin' all the chrome and shinin' up the tires
Smokin' joint after joint, I couldn't get no higher
Keep a mini-bong chillin' in my cup holder
Plus a bag in my lap full of nothin' but the dosha
Cruisin' out the neighborhood on a slow stoncreek (??)
I'm just out ridin' high, simply doin' my thing

be Real:
Hittin' the weed and become just like me
Kush smokin' rebel full of THC (??)
One hit, two hit, three hit, four
Then five more hits from my eight foot Roor
Then roll that shit up and hit it, pass it around
Don't hog it up or we take it away and put you down
You wanna medicate, meditate
Been known for hittin' the bong, blunts, and the vaporate
We ridin' high with an endless supply
Because we ?? and put the red in your eyes
We sack it up in three months, packin' the free lunch
After the 420, we stackin' the damn money
And so it goes if you're holidn' the dro
Break it out, blaze it up, then you hittin' & hold (??)
With the KMK or the Cypress blend
You better twist those ends and go tell your friends

We rollin' out like Willy and the Chocolate Bunch
With a ??, blowin' nothin' but the Skunk

More attention to the light
Burning up at the very touch, runaway train
I perform the ritual, take away all the pain
Free you from this life, from my hands I release you

Another chapter starts and more darkness fills the ages
And another stage is set for many names upon the pages

Blending with the masses, now I'm fittin' in society
Hide behind the mask overwhelmed by the anxiety

I dreamed of two blue orchids
So full of love and light
That I wanted to possess each tender bloom
Then my dream took wings
And through a thousand springs
Blue orchids seemed in a world apart
But when I met you
Something pale and blue
Came stealing from the meadows of my heart
I saw my two blue orchids
My beautiful blue orchids
Last night and what a sweet surprise

Cyril Grantham,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Say it isn?t so,
Everyone is saying
You don?t love me,

Everywhere I go,
Everyone I know,

Whispers that you?re growing tired of me,
Say it isn?t so.
People say that you,

Found somebody new,
And it won?t be long
Before you leave me,
Say it isn?t true,

Say that everything is still okay,
That?s all I want to know,

And what they?re saying,
Say it isn?t so.

It fills me with longing for you;
Am I taking too much for granted,
Wond'ring if you miss me too?
 
Tho' we said ""goodbye,"" when the moon is high,
Does your heart beat for me?
I wonder if I still linger 
In your memory.
When you hear my name, is the thrill the same
as it once used to be?
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart, 
Does your heart beat for me.

Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""

Said when the next one arrives

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Me crie ""bonjour, mon loup""

You took the bait and now you're looking like a fool 
Don't ask how we do it so cool 
Don't ask us to break the rules 
It's all about the bassline, it's all about the clues 

It's all about the hairline and it's all about the game 
Don't ask me to say my name 

Don't ask me to share my fame

It's all about the flashlights, it's all about the flames 

You took the bait and now you're looking like a fool 

Don't ask how we do it so cool 

Don't ask us to break the rules 
It's all about the bassline, it's all about the clues",Intro,2007

Czech Film Orchestra,"Yo era la rosa dorada del sol,
Lluvia de vino, burbuja de amor
Why mi palacio fue la juventud,
Cuando cantaba yo, soñabas tu.

Tuve la gloria, tuve la devoción
Why me sentí querida,
Mimada por la vida,
Ciega de delirante ilusión.

Aria de amor,
Mientras apluaden tras el telón,
En el ocaso muere el viejo dios.

Aria de amor, una quimera, una canción,
Que la victoria es grande
Why Europa grande, ay.
Grande es el destino hoy.

Yo era la diva de aquella nación,
Grandes teatros llenaba mi voz
Why mi palacio tan hermoso ayer
De soledad why mármol fué después.

La decandencia, la solución final.
Entre mil banderas, cruces why calaveras.
Símbolos de quimeras,
Te perdí.

Aria de amor,
Mientras aplauden tras el telón
En el ocaso mueres, vieja Europa;
Sola, ay, loca why hundida.

Aber warum ists so dunkel hier?
Warum diese dunkel hiet?
Io sono disperata
Je suis saoule, je suis saoule d'amour?!!!

Oigo las bombas, águilas de terror
Why sueño en la basura
Que vuelve tu figura
Why me refugio en el alcohol.

Aria de amor,
Una quimera, una canción;
Que la derrota es grande,
Why Europa, ay,
Why grandes al fin tu why yo.

Czech Film Orchestra And Choir,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai
Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai","Caruso, for voice & orchestra",2005
Czech Film Orchestra And Choir,"The house where I was born
Still stands
For who I am
Every stone laid
Is a bridge made to my past

The house where I grew tall
Towers
Over me
Shadows bring everything back in soft light
I wouldn't change yesterday not in my life
And so, I live in a house of no regrets

There are many rooms inside my head
Corridors that wind, through time, never end
They are journeys made to be

Every house is part of me

The house where I found love
Lingers
Sends me shivers
Like the first time
Stairways I climb to the heights

The house where I grew old
Will be
Free of ghosts
From what I've done I won't run come the dark night
I wouldn't change yesterday not in my life
The years show, I live in a house of no regrets","Chi Mai (originally composed for Maddalena, film score) [From Chi Mai]",2005

What a wonderful thing a sunny day
The cool air after a thunderstorm
The fresh breezes banish the heavy air
What a wonderful thing a sunny day

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face

Shining is the glass from your window
A washwoman is singing and bragging
Wringing and hanging laundry and singing
Shining is the glass from your window

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face

When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down
I start feeling blue
I'd stay below your window
When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face

Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.

Walk on through the rain,
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown.Walk on, walk on

And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone.","You'll Never Walk Alone, song (from ""Carousel"")",2005
