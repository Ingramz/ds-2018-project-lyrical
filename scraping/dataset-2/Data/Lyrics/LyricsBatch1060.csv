You can catch him on the dance floor, I toss to this

Our description (uh uh)

Motherfucker that cant be
All I gotta say is keep oit pimpin' pimpin' (keep it pimpin' pimpin')
And I dont trust these motherfuckin' hoes (oh oh)",Bitches Ain't S**t,2004
Suga Free,"[Verse 1]
Okay which way you want to go nigga
Left, right, up, down, come on man
Just find it on yourself, man come on now
Pimp's probably a bit too much
Pimps went dead with this year's shit here
Man pimp pimp pimp pimp, you got chewed up
Lisa had a problem
She never realized that all the dick she was suckin
In the hood, she could have made herself mountains
But it's my fault cause she a ho and didn't listen to a pimp
So she writin you in the pen over and over again
See I believe in servin a nigga his papers wHen I knock his ho
Like a pimp did me on Beach Blvd, know
I got knocked, gon get knocked, de-knocked, re-knocked
But I'ma knick-knock my motherfuckin self, I'm Suga Free, ha
I, P-I,	oh my, M-P, oh I, for life
Knock knock for winter (ha ha), me too
Like a are-2 twin magnetic pimp response
Plus yo ass sweatin me like a cheap suit

[Chorus]
Just when you thought the pimpin was in you
Ah ah, it's just on you (I can't warn you)
What's wrong? Kitty cat get her nosebleed?
It's red ribbon week? It's just on you (you can't win)
Fire engines, and ????
It's just on you (you can't win)
And just when you thought that $500 was for another abortion
Gotcha, it's just on you (I can't warn you)

[Verse 2]
Now I, can't, believe, how, y'all, niggaz
Still, don't, know, how, a ho, go
They make more, pay more
A doctor or a nurse or a vet
They say a pimp walked on water, and he never got wet
See sometime it feel like the pimpin be dead
But that's a temporary condition too
A quota peep that he could be a ho
But he called back (cool)
And I can't believe how some of y'all niggaz
Let the glory pass you by
But steady want to pick my brain about the game and ask why
And if it wasn't for tony
y'all motherfuckers'd still be ridin around Pomona Gospel
Spittin like bitches to my homies

[Chorus]
A strong wind 40 days and 40 nights
Suckers, it's just on you (you can't win)
When she disrespect you in front of your homeboys
You are the weakest link, cause it's just on you (you can't win)
Man I mean she gon be either a stand-up ho
or a fall-down bitch, man it's just on you (you can't win)
Now you know you're with a square when Red Cross won't give her coffee

[Verse 3]
God said he wasn't gon put no more meat that I could stand
Ho it mean after you leave me I cop and blow
And be the chain of a man (Amen)
Here's a story about a pimp that they ain't took out yet
But died 8 or 9 times and ain't found him yet
I tell your man I just be sittin back lookin (lookin)
Listenin (listenin), learnin (learnin)
Pimpin (pimpin), and I don't see no difference
Peep, wolf disguised as sheep
That's how I stalk my prey
Every single day, I don't know no other way
Born again! Pimp different, hear different, feel different
Look different, Walk different, talk different
And the tricks you fuckin never try to keep up with him
That's what they do
Don't even think you fuckin her better than him
I mean the joint bout-it man will knock you straight on your back
Just like you got the Holy Ghost, feelin good, go like that
And to inquirin minds that want to know
I got on Stains, fucked it up
Popped the pen, I left with my ho

[Chorus]
And outta all the pimpin goin on around you
It's just on you
I mean that a goddamn drop touched on you
See, it's just on you
Mean to tell me you mad at the pimpin cause
you don't see no difference? (it's just on you)
Just when you got a taste for steak in your mouth
She gave you bologna cause it's just on you
When she said all she did was kiss him
And you said okay that's when she knew it's just on you
Just when you thought that givin her all that dick
Was the shit nigga I couldn't warn you
Better get yo ass way from around here
I ain't playin (good morning)
Be good or be good at it
goddamnit, it's just on you
I'ma go in a worm but I'ma come out a butterfly motherfucker
It's just on you
Relax all your muscles (it's just on you)",Born Again,2004

[SUGAFREE]
Hey sugafree why roxy jock'n
Probly because she don't want you to know she got caught watchin a parrot fuck a carrot of some of that oxy cotton
She said one time at band camp she was a rat
And sold girl scout cookies lyin flat on her back
One day I was in the middle of some sucka duckin
Got tired of throwin my hood up at this trick
Bust up like it was nothin
I met her out the blue sky, I truly neva knew why
But kept it pimpin in that ora she love me 'cause I'm to fly

CHORUS:
'cause I'm the only kinda man that she'll eva understand because that's what the pimpins there for
She rather deal with a mack and keep her flat on her back because that's what the pimpins there for

SUGAFREE:

You wouldn't believe that bitch used to be a fuckin custodian
That's what I get for lovin shit
Sincerely yours suga free and thank you for nothin

CHORUS: 2X

Writin these raps checkin traps all day
Spittin real butta stay away from parkay
Ask me what I do man I pimp and parlay
What's really though

I wouldn't care if she smoked dope shot rope aor chased a billy goat
But you don't hear me though
Paint her red
You need to pray and repent
She might be ya girlfriend yeah but she my trim
And I ain't payin respects I'm just takin the checks
And beat the shit outa buff niggas fakin the flex
We keep it A O B....all on baby
Y'all pay for puss man y'all so crazy
Ya trick harder than the N be A
And got mad when ya be's got sent my way
'cause you in love with yaself and she in love with ya wealth
And wanna grin while she still fuckin everyone else
But she ain't got no manners or self esteem
If I push the right buttons I could sell her a dream
And y'all still poppin collars imma dust my kicks
While y'all still go to clubs and handcuff yo bitch

CHORUS:

suga free and baby bash talkin

Made her steal some new shoes and get me some dough
And this ain't no studio shit
How you think them ugly cats get a beautiful bitch
And I just call em how I see em
From the a.m to the p.m
Its young baby bash from the hustle mozileum
I spit cash, I spit cash
I put a hoe on the track in iraq

[Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a mutharfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the muthafuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my muthafuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cuz the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

[Daz]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this
(Snoop: BEEEYYAAACHHH!)

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to long beach
Just so i could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)
Cuz a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)
Cuz a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out
Now

[Snoop]
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a muthafucka lickin' the protung
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the muthafuckin' county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some muthafuckin' chin checkin'
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo

I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!

(Dr. Dre in background ""Bitches ain't shit"")
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin' my own thing down with the swang
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
Cuz I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck (Repeat x3)

And now I gotta do some
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flo' ho
But they can't hang with my type on swang
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With the tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung

In the spot coming from my Gucci lenses
Plus tour buses scoops and Benzes
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts
Now I get my homies and my hemmys down
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere 
But success don't rest out of hair corvair
Big rozay hoe's day when I come and show them
This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze
Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over , baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

Two fucker take a break to take a shot
Restaurant closed so we go in
Have my Iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Walk by my hotel room door and 
I'm sure you hear us bone and probably came the moment
And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10
Blind 'cause you really bout eaten a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
And I got one more favor to ask
Can I put a lil' bit cocaine on your ass
I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider ass

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over , baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg
Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nervous nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin' hoe
Pow, vroom! shake with a fine grim
And both out to shine like a barn bill
I'm too cool don't I walk like I got it all down to a science fiction
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning, 
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free

When I walked on the snow baby
And the sound of shy day fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hussler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that,
And understand God made pimps so a hoe can have a man
A trip won't understand
Suga Free, my man!

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over , baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober",Sober,2013
Suga Free,"Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for
Got my dope from cross the border
Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go

Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it

Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you

Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?

You mean to tell me, you'd rather save this bitch than save this whale?
It's mighty skeptical
Quik, all these years and you ain't gave me a Pee, nah, I'm talkin' about the vegetable

How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar, because we are hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them
And then they sex play me, sounding fruity

Eleven coffees, Rickki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue

Erased your number from my telephone

Eleven hours on a brand new day

A bunch of flowers and I slam the door

Takes more than begging to reverse my brain

Nothing more 'cause life is how I wanted to be
With you and me
Staying together, yeah

Take it all, I'm here boy
I got what you need here, talk to me
And help me breathe
I wanna hold on
To sweet memories

It's wasting time until your heart and mind realizes I am the one
I can't disguise my love for you-It's true I can't

Wait for you to be there
All my life, I need
Someone to make me feel good
And I wish that it was you

Images always pass me by
Feel like leaving the walk behind
When I think of you

Every moment I'm fighting this
Had to erase all your messages
Couldn't handle the things we said
Still I'm feeling you

Lately you've been slipping away from me
I try to keep holding on
I cannot be wrong
There's something I didn't see

We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Every time a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes then I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together

Ain't how funny how sweet I dream
But the bed keeps on getting colder

It feels like I'm living by numbers

I gotta stop 'cause it's pulling me under

Lettin' you work your way around my body.
Whatever you got I'm guessin' I got more.
Even with no regrets you won't be sorry.

I'm getting down, low
But things ain't right, you're gone,
I'm losing ground, no

Do you remember when your heart was mine?
It's all I ever think when it comes to you and I
No I can't feel right, I'll be good and seal the deal
The rhythm can't just go its the only thing of you

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
I lost my rhythm when you said it's over,
And as the final record starts to play,
I feel the dance floor turning colder,

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
Cause all the music in my world has faded,
I know it's never gonna be the same,
I guess the moves just never made it

All this time, I'll work, I'll find
A perfect picture that I store in my heart
We were so bright to know we couldn't get it right
Our bodies are in twain now I can't get you off my mind
As we dance you know our feelings show
You oughtta know you got me
As we dance we know my heart's exposed
Now I'm alone you left me

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
I lost my rhythm when you said it's over,

The record goes around, they're playing our song
I gave into the groove but its giving me pain
There's nothing you can do for me Mr. DJ

So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified

It terrifies me to think I'm not the only one
You'd be surprised how much I cry when you are gone

When your angel's the devil
Your church is a tomb
But I need to be with you

I'm undignified
Enough for two

It's not how I wanna live

Backstroke lover,
Hidin' undercover
Still I talk to your daddy, he say:
""You ain't seen nothin'
'til your down on a muffin
And I'm sure I can change your ways
Then I met cheerleader,
Was a real young pleaser
All the times I could reminisce
The best thing lovin'
Was a brother and a cousin
And it started with a little kiss,

School girl Heidi
With her classy, kinda sassy
Little skirt climbin' way up her knees,
Three young ladies
In the school gym locker-
I noticed they were lookin' at me,
I was a high school loser,
Never made it with a fella
'til my girls told me somethin' I missed
A next door neighbour, 
With a son, had a favor
So I gave him just a little kiss,
Like this!

And our feet flyin' up in the air

Singin' hey-diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You'll be swingin' like you just don't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With the boy - he was ready to play

Was it me he was foolin' 'cause he knew what he was doin'
When he told me how to walk this way?

He carved my name into a tree
First cut's the deepest
And I left him bleeding

Boy 2 had earned a law degree
He charged me with a felony
I stole his heart
And pled insanity

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Boy 3 worked at the cemetery
His crooked smile was kinda sweet
All things must end
Now he is 6 feet deep

Boy 4 was filthy rich indeed
He flew a private jet but see
He crashed and burned
There's just no buying me

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Boy 5 composed a symphony
Strings and choir just for me
Then he turned deaf
It was a tragedy

Boy 6 lived in a monastery
He chose a life of poverty
I chose Chanel
So much for chastity

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done

He tried to kiss
And tell on me so now he
Sleeps with the fishes, arrivederci baby

Last boy was a director on a silver screen
He went and wrote a slasher flick just for me
When he said cut
I took it literally

Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done

Christmas comes this time each year

There's a tale about Christmas that we've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

Just a little bob sled he calls Little Saint Nick
But she'll walk the toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

With a half a dozen reindeer with the Rudy the lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

The way you're longing inside

Exactly what you need
I know it's been your fantasy
But I can make it real

I want to taste
The chocolate on your lips
We both know
That your body can't resist

I know you're longing inside

So why fantasize alone?

And I just laugh cause he suffered the wrath
Now the man added time to his liberty path

Dressed in holiday style 
In the air 
There's a feeling of Christmas 

Children laughing 
People passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear 

Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day 

Strings of street lights 
Even stop lights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures 

Hear the snow crunch 
See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle 
You'll hear

I'm a togger not a fogger step on hunts and don't do stunts
I got soul power never took a cold shower
Never had a girlfriend the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy 'cause my rhymes are kinda greasy
Some brothers wear curls, 'cause it ain't easy being peasy
Like a kung-fu flick, I stick you in the dick, with my toothpick
Tell 'em rick (you hit them harder than a fuckin' brick)
I like clothes and hoes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feets move, they happen everyday
When the ro to the j bring his ass out to play
I weight one-eighty but I'm, fat
I ki-uh-kick up dust when I bust like a cap
Tha alkaholik crew, and what we're here to do
Is rock a show, knock a hoe, and crack another brew

Make room, for the crew with beats that thump 
Make room, for the crew with beats that thump
Make room, for the crew with beats that thump

It's the licks baby, it's the licks 
It's the licks baby, it's the licks 
It's the licks baby, it's the licks 

The super, duper, gets it poppin' with the quickness
King tee and the alkies straight gettin' down to business
It's all about the liks 'cause we're heavy on the kicks
But we're easy on the treble (adjust my mic level)
So fools can here me mic checkin' all the way in china
The skills you can't front on, tha alkaholik rhymer
Could rip a show up to' up so I always flex my talents
But my words don't be slurrin', I never lose my balance
But that's 'cause I'm slick tossin bottles like a discus
The liks could rock a party from Halloween to christmas
That's why I'm screamin' on mc's like I'm onyx
I'm hooked on gin and tonics like your momma's hooked on phonics
So when we steppin' through, with the thirty-two of brew
Niggas better make way for the alkaholik crew
When we're steppin' through, with the thirty-two of brew
Niggas better make way for the alkaholik crew

[Chorus]

First you gotta have respect, money comes next
After you get those, come the hoes and the sex
Girl you keep askin bout the niggas in my crew
Yeah I'm down with pooh, but what's up with me and you
Cause I don't give a fuck whose your cousin who could fuck
Cause I just wanna fuck, damn I wanna fuck
So unlock the gate and make room for the heavyweight rapper
The slim light skinned coochie slapper
Pull over to the side so I can roll up the indo
Got the bitch head bumpin' on the front window
Wham, bam, I spanked you ma'am
I wonder how they make these rubbers from the skin of a lamb
I blow into the mic when I check it
Had hoes gettin' naked way before I made a record
I smoked a gang of liquor, I drink a gang of boom
Like ted, I gotta zoom zoom so make room

We gotta give a shout out to the crew

With my pencil turning moments into line
High above in the violet sky
A silent silver plane - it draws a golden chain
One by one, all the stars appear
As the great winds of the planet spiral in
Spinning away, like the night sky at Arles
In the million insect storm, the constellations form
On a hill, under a raven sky
I have no idea exactly what I've drawn
Some kind of change, some kind of spinning away
With every single line moving further out in time
And now as the pale moon rides (in the stars)
Her form in my pale blue lines (in the stars)
And there, as the world rolls round (in the stars)
I draw, but the lines move round (in the stars)
There, as the great wheels blaze (in the stars)
I draw, but my drawing fades (in the stars)
And now, as the old sun dies (in the stars)
I draw, and the four winds sigh (in the stars)",Spinning Away,2000

Sugar Ray,"Now this is somethin' from back in the day
I'll always remember Run DMC
And all the good times
That we had on the beach
Stealing sips from a paper cup
And making out in the sand
Maybe I'm dreaming
Can you tell me

Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)

I'll always remember everything we do
Rockin' the eighties blastin' K-R-O-Q
I remember Culture Club
The Clash, and Men Without Hats
Seems kind of funny right now
But it's taking me back
We'd always sing along
And laugh out loud at ourselves
Don't want to stop dreaming
Can you tell me

Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)

I want to rewind every time
'Cause the words have so much meaning
They were there when nobody cared
Always knew what I was feeling
Stay tonight don't leave me reminiscing
All I do is wind up missing you
Are you missing me
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Are you missing me (Na na na na na na)

And I probably should fix my hair

I'm never really sure that I'll ever change 
But if it makes you happy then I will lie

The first thing they do they want his autograph
And I just laugh cause he suffered the wrath
Now the man added time to his liberty path

But he gets a lot of love from the kids in Jodeci

In these hills
Looking for a map to find
What we left behind
Knowing that we will
Always end up right where we start
'Cause I've got time on my hands
And hope in my heart

Bring May flowers
I have seen rain before
But if Sunday morning
Lets that sun in
What are we waiting for?
'Cause love leaves an open door

If I had one wish
I'd wish for two
One for me, baby
One for you
It would find you
Right where you are
With time on your hands
And hope in your heart
We both understand
We were written in the stars

Bring May flowers

But if Sunday morning
Lets that sun in
What are we waiting for?

Till I find what I lost in your eyes

Cherry bombs and cherry wine
Just past the Texaco

Spanish moss on a welcome sign
Catch a buzz, we all get scary

Out where you leave them all behind
Out where the moons shines sweetly
Won't you meet me
Down on the county line?

Pink slips and white wall tires
Bet you twenty I'll beat you there
Down on the county line

First love and football wars
French kiss and battle prize
Further then I've been before

Learned to smile even when I was falling down

When they sleep, he swears they're angels
He wouldn't trade a day for all those Friday nights

Can you see me?
If you saw me you would cry
I'll die for getting better
I will write you love letters, I'll try

I'll be a biblical boy
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

It takes time, it takes two
You better wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, to come back
To make our comeback, you better

It takes time, it takes two
You better wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, to come back
To make our comeback, you better

Does it hurt now?
And the pain will explode
Is it hard when you're running down that road
While carrying that load

So release me
And I'll make you aware
That it takes time, it takes two
To make old into new, and I swear

I'll be a biblical boy
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

It takes time, it takes two
You better wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, you better
Wait for me too, to come back
To make our comeback, you better

You'd better come back
You'd better come back
You'd better come back

His love for me is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and I are one
I bow to his might
Too powerful to fight
It's my destiny
Now the maniac lives inside of me
He's back
An army at his command
A strength that you can't comprehend
A force unknown can now be told
The power of the world he holds
A feeling you can't kill
It's the power. It's the will
Controls your thoughts but you can't see
Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears
He feels no pain, he has no mercry or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue
And now the maniac's a part of you
And the time has come. The maniac you'll meet
He takes your hand and now you bow down to his feet
His love for you is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and you are one

Say goodbye to peace and order
You and my terror will meet

Well maybe that is true
But I can't describe the feeling I get
When I take revenge on you

Forgiveness is the key to destruction
But you can't open my door

But if anyone were to read a bit - they'd think I was a bit pecular

The feeling's back and you just can't stop it
The feeling's back and you just can't stop it 

I fought a thousand times, I never knew the meaning of the word fear
Till that one day when I stood alone, staring straight in the mirror

Until I realize I'm the only one that put me in this place

Suicidal Tendencies,"Got home kind of late last night
My mind wasn't clear, but I could tell something wasn't right
So silent I could hear my heart pump
But then I heard a sound that made me jump 

I tried to get real brave, tried to look around
I tried to find out from where came that sound
The more I looked, the less I could see
But the voices keep calling, calling out of me 

I hear voices, when I'm all alone
Hearing voices, but there's nobody home
Hear the voices, could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices, I look why can't I see 

I hear voices, can't stop those voices 

It happened again, the very next day
I still couldn't understand what they were try to say
Could only get the courage to open up one eye
Couldn't see nothing, but the voices they don't lie 

I search and search but not a soul I found
Pretty damn sure no one was around
The more I looked the less I could see
Then I realized the voices were calling from me 

I hear voices, when I'm all alone
Hearing voices, but there's nobody home
Hear the voices, could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices, I look why can't I see 

Are they demons, or are they angels or am I crazy 

Now the voices I start to understand
They have to do with the Master plan
You think about what you'd do
Cause one day the voices will be calling out to you
The voices I hear now I know are true
They come not from one but they come from two

From which voice will I listen

Suicidal Tendencies,"Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help but no one's around
Silently screaming I bang my head against the wall
It seems like no one cares at all
Always an emotion, but how can I explain
How can I explain
Kind of like the scent of a rose
With words I can't explain
The same with my pain
Caught up in emotion-Goes over my head
Goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death
Am I living or am I dead
The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And when I think about all the times that I've had
So few good-So many bad
I search for personality and I look for things I can not see

Love and peace flash through my mind
Pain and hate are all I find
Find no hope in nothing new
Never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony
Through my eyes that's all I see

Will you wipe away my tears?
If I'm gonna die

If I don't wake up in the morning-would anyone even be there

You can put me down-you can put me out, you can try to ignore
But now you're gonna hear me when I shout WAKE UP

Why should I wake up in the morning-it be just another wasted day
Why should I wake up in the morning-don't do nothing right anyway

That was then-not anymore-now I go blasting out the door
I'm gonna wake up in the morning-I'll prove you wrong I will not fail

Suicidal Tendencies,"I sailed forever, I sailed so far, and now I know just what the consequences are
I laughed out loudy, while I cried inside
But I didn't haave the strength to say enough of this ride
Like a fool-I believed in a miracle
I wanted to forget, of what I'm not sure
But I found an answer-it seemed to be a perfect cure

Controlled my actions, controlled my thoughts
Controlled my feelings, and now I feel my body rot-like a fool
I believed in the miracle

Twisting and I'm turning-freezing then I'm burning
Laughing then I'm crying-am I living or am I dying
Swearing then I'm praying-don't even know what I'm saying
Happy then so sad-forgiving then so mad

Do you still, do you still believe, do you still believe in,
Do you still believe in miracles?

Pushing then pulling-who am I fooling
A friend then a foe-do I really even know?
Love and then hate
Peace then at war-but what am I fighting for
And you always try to
Keep me-oh so sleepy
So I can't realize-that it's all lies
And the more it takes hold of me-the less chance that I'll ever be free
And even though I don't believe-it's so hard to leave-a miracle-a miracle

Waiting-always hesitating-for that perfect day-that day was yesterday
And the more you're gonna wait-the more of a chance that it will be too late

How can you afford to wait, you just can't afford to wait

And now you'll see me cry no more, don't even know what I was crying for",The Miracle,1988
Suicidal Tendencies,"Never good at talking, so many things I couldn't say
But those thoughts never went away
And I'm sure you remember, said that all I wanted was sympathy,

Too many times-I felt so sad and lonely
Too many times-I needed someone there
Too many times-I tried to tell you something
Too many times-It seemed like no one cared

And I don't like asking-and it's not easy to say-
I never learned how to pray
So if you have a moment it means so much to me oh can't you see-
If you'd just say a prayer for me

Too many times-I didn't even have a second
Too many times-you thought I was much too strong
Too many times-you said the feeling wouldn't last forever
Too many times-I proved you so damn wrong

Saw the changes-thought they'd go away-do you still remember that day
Can't really fault you-only have myself to blame-
But do you still feel the same

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
But I waited so long-for someone to take my hand, and say they understand

And I waited so long-for someone to show the way-to make a better day
and I waited so long-for someone to spare a kiss for the love I miss
And I waited so long-for you to looke me in the eye
And say it's worth another try
But yo keep me waiting-waiting-too many times

You keep me waiting, one too many, one too many, one too many times,
Too many times
One too many one too many one too many times too many times

9. Feeding The Addiction

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

You haven't eaten in days and your gums are bleeding
Swearing to God the pipe's all you're needing
It's robbing or stealing or turning a trick
You do whatever it takes to suck on the Devil's dick

The more you feed it, the harder it is to tame
Taking in the Beast, playing it like a game
Lying to yourself saying the same old shit
""I don't need it, I just don't want to quit""

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

The hunger of addiction calls
There's nothing romantic about going through withdrawals
You're craving a sample well, here's just a taste
Picking and scratching the scabs on your face

Your life support system's a syringe
Killing a piece of your soul every time you binge
Praying to God and begging for forgiveness
Knowing damn well that you can't keep going on like this

This is addiction
Feed the addiction
This is addiction

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

I won't give up the plot but here's a few surprises
Muscle spasms, you're puking as your temperature rises
Led off to slaughter like a heard of cattle
The demons inside have won the battle

The Devil takes another soul to burn
What does it take for another fool to learn
The ritual's over as another one dies
The ritual begins as another one tries

It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
Feeding...the monster!

To say what I feel when nothing seems real
Not easy, it's not easy
To be someone's friend when the pain it never ends
Not easy, it's not easy
To keep up the fight when nothing turns out right

Easy I got to take it easy, I got to take it easy
Easy it's not easy to open your heart when love's torn it apart
Easy it's not easy to hold your head high when you want to sit and cry

Suicidal Tendencies,"Well I just had to turn off the radio
But not before I heard thirteen songs about love in a row
Well I don't know what the next song's gonna be
But I know how the words are gonna go
They'll be singing 'Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby I love you so'
So won't everybody sing along cause her comes just another love song

I need you like I need a hole in my head
I need someone to steal my money and wish I were dead
I need someone to always put me down
And everywhere I go she wants to hang around

[Chorus]
Do you really even think dreams come true
Do you really even think you'll find something wonderful and new
Do you really even think someone's waiting for you
Do you really even thiink that love is near
Do you really even think it's me dear
Do you really even think I want to hear-but I still say
I won't fall in love today

I need a chick who's got expensive taste
Who's not afraid of whose money she wastes
You expect me to buy you a diamond ring!
Well I suspect I'll buy you not a thing!

[Chorus]]

Well I could tell you you're the only one I love
And how your eyes sparkle like the stars above
And that I carry a picture of you in my heart
And as long as we live we'll never be apart
And that you're the most important person in my life
But I can't handle a girlfriend, how am I gonna handle a wife

Love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate
love-hate
I love, love, love to hate you but I'd hate, hate, hate to love you

I could promise all my love to you
But that would take me only a second or two
And if you're waiting to be my one and only
You're gonna find out what it's like to be awfully lonely
Your song was alright for awhile-But now your tune's gone out of style

You want to cuddle and hug all night
But I'm going out with my friends tonight
And I don't need someone to act like my mother
I already have one-I don't need another

Suicidal Tendencies,"Fuck it!
He's a carrier of death, a stork in reverse
He blesses you with sickness
Cause love is a curse
The arsening in your Koolaid, the bomb in your mail,
He disappears in motion
But leaves a bloody trail
(Chorus)
Drop to your knees, humble you pray
But can't put off your judgment day
There's a knock at your door, who could it be?
You got a new friend that's gonna set you free
He's making a list, he's checking it twice
No amount of money's gonna stop this vice
(Chorus)
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy. You want mercy?
No fuckin' mercy! Oh no
With the wink of an eye, a snap of the finger
Now the smell of death is all that lingers
A doctor of death with a PhD, a specialist in pure misery
(Chorus)
See you fucked with him even though you knew
And now your worst nightmares all come true
You scream and shout you beg and plead
But he's got your soul and that's all that he needs

He's the master, master of no mercy, no mercy, no mercy",Master of No Mercy,1989
Suicidal Tendencies,"Kept in the guard of Mother Nature's womb
Resting in the safety of their tomb
Sheltered by six feet of soil and rock
The spade is the key with which their gate we'll unlock
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied
So we wait till the stroke of the midnight hour
Then we'll unleas the darkest of power
Hell's gates will open a new judgment day
Now is the time that the dead will pay
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied
Waking the dead, waking the dead, waking the dead
All rise!
Hell's gates open the earth trembles and shakes
Now their pardons are over they pray for their mistakes
Mausoleums firebombed now rage in flames
When the dead come out their bodies we'll maim
CHORUS
Rob-Robbing their graves stealing their bones
Bang-Banging our heads to their screams and their moans
Fix-Fixing the wounds that even time cannot heal
Soon-Soon we will know how good it feels
This is not damnation or an act of God
Now the dead they rise ripping through the sod
Purgatory has to wait, but how can this be
The dead are free-the dead are free!
CHORUS
Waking the dead-you said that it wouldn't be
Waking the dead-You said that we wouldn't see
Waking the dead-Now the dead stand before our own eyes
Silence is blaring the earth opens wide
History repeats, reburied they die
Darkness descends through nature's pores
They return to their sleep on earth's basement floor
Now they rest not so peacefully
As they've had a taste of our misery
I didn't care that they'd already died
That wasn't enough to make me satisfied
Return back to their tombs now they lay
This is no game for the novice to play
Repeat not a word lest ye be forewarned
The punishment of Hell's darkness and scorn
Repeat not a word of the sermon said
A prayer for the dead, don't play with the dead
Don't try to comprehend what's going on
You can't understand, please don't understand
Waking the dead-And we'll be
Waking the dead-All rise now
Waking the dead-We're gonna wake the dead
Waking the dead
I said the words what have I done
I thought it cool, I thought it fun
The words I say they start to change
The syllables now rearranged
A language I can't comprehend
I shut my mouth it doesn't end
The bowels of nature open wide
I cannot move I cannot hide
I can't believe the things I see
The dead are free, the dead are free
I close my eyes and pray it's not real
Their presence close coldness I feel
What have I done Lord please forgive
Once they died, but now they live
I wake the dead, I ake the dead, I wake the dead, I wake the dead!

Suicidal Tendencies,"Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help, no one's around
Silently screaming as I bang my head against the wall
Seems like no one cares at all

Always an emotion but how could I explain?
Kinda like the scent of a rose but you can't explain
The same with my pain, caught up in emotion, goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death
Am I living or am I dead?

The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And then I think about all the times that I've had
Some were good, most were bad

I search for personality, and I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind, pain and hate is all I'd find
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony through my eyes that's all I see

If I'm gonna cry, will you wipe away my tears?
And if I'm gonna die, Lord, please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow, well, I just want to say
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?

Today, today, today when I can't even smile today
Today, today, today when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?

You think something?s funny?
Laugh at this

So when I look outside my room, I see the world but not the reason
What is done to me is not fair, you call it fate, I call it treason
But I know not what to do, gimme a sign, I'll take whatever
But if you want me, here I am, ain't gonna die forever

And I tried to hold you but you just turned away
And I tried to tell you but not a word I say
Cried out so loudly but you just covered your ears
I gave you all the signs but you ignored my tears

So if you want me, here I am, I sit here, waiting for your decision
But my body fights my mind and it is headed straight for a collision
So am I getting near or am I still looking in all the wrong places?
But the only thing that seems to change are the looks on the faces

Doesn't anyone? Seems like no one cares at all

I search for personality, I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind, pain and hate is all I'd find
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony, through my eyes that's all I see

Suicidal Tendencies,"I scream at the sky, it's easier than crying
I'm shyest when I'm shouting out loud
I feel so alone in a room full of people
I'm loneliest when I'm out in a crowd
I'm alone, and nobody hears me
Can't nobody heal me, won't somebody help me

I'm alone (I just need)
Someone to take my hand and pick me up when I'm feeling down
Someone to take my heart and give it a home
Someone to help me through the times when I'm down and lonely
Someone to be with me when I'm alone, (I'm alone, all alone)

Alone is the way I live, it's not the way I want it but you know
You can't give in, alone is the way I feel, it's so hard to understand
Why I've got to be alone

If you took a look at my heart you'd see it
I'm trying to be something better
If you look at my heart you'd feel it
I've got to keep moving on
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm just trying to make my world better
If you look in my heart you'd see it
I got to do it alone

I've been down, I've been down
I've been down, down, down so low
I've been lost, so lost with no place left to go
I've had emotions, emotions that you better hope you never know
Sometimes it feels like I just can't take no more

If you took a look at my heart you'd see it
I'm trying to be something better
If you look at my heart you'd feel it
I've got to keep moving on
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm just trying to make my world better
If you look in my heart you'd see it
I got to do it alone

Seems like things just keep getting further out of hand
Why can't for once things just go as I plan
How dare you, how dare you tell me that you understand?
Let me tell you straight out, there ain't nobody here that can
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone

If you look in my heart, you'll see it
If you look in my heart, you'd feel it
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm not trying to make no one bitter
I'm just alone, leave me alone, alone, alone, now leave me

I've lived in places that you wouldn't never ever want to be
Places where for a minute you couldn't ever stand to be
I've seen things, I've seen things you'd never want to see
So what gives, what gives you the right to be the judge of me
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone

A room full of people, can't nobody hear me, can't nobody help me, I'm alone
I just need someone to take my hand
And pick me up when I'm feeling down (when I'm down)

Someone to take my heart and give it a home (when I'm down)
Someone to be with me and help me through the times
I'm down and lonely (when I'm down)
Someone to be with me (when I'm alone)
I'm alone, all alone

I was in meditation and prayer last night
I was awakened by a shining bright light
Overhead a glorious spirit, he gave me a message and you all need to hear it
""Send me your money,"" that's what he said
He said to ""Send me your money""
Now if you can only send a dollar or two
There ain't a hell of a lot I can promise to you
But if you wants to see heaven's door
Make out a check for five hundreds or more
""Send me your money"", do you hear what I said?
""Send me your money""

Now give me some bass, um yea that's how he like it
Now let's have some silence, for all you sinners
Now give me more bass, yea that was funky
Now take them on home Brother Clark, send me your money
Here comes another con hiding behind a collar
His only God is the almighty dollar
He ain't no prophet, he ain't no healer
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer
Send me your money
Send it, you got to send it
Send me your money
You hear what I'm saying?
You got to send it, send it
Send me your money

Now how much you give is your own choice
But to me it is the difference between a Porsche and a Rolls Royce
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket
'Cause it makes me feel so good to watch my profits rocket

Send me your money
Now dig in deep, dig real deep into your pocket
I want you to make it hurt!
We'll take cash, we'll take checks
We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them
So whose gonna be the new king of the fakers
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker?
See my momma, she didn't raise no fool
'Cause you can't put a price on a miricle

Suicidal Tendencies,"What the hell's going on around here?
First off-let's take it from the start
Straight out-can't change what's in my heart
No one-can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me
You ain't-never seen no one like me
Prevail-regardless what the cost might be
Power-flows inside of me, you can't bring me
Never-fall as long as I try
Refuse-to be part of your lie
Even-if it means I die, you can't bring me
You can't bring me down!
Who the hell you calling crazy?
You wouldn't know what crazy was if Charles Manson
...was eating Fruit Loops on your front porch
Time out-let's get something clear
I speak-more truth than you want to hear
Scapegoat-to cover up your fear, you can't bring me
You ain't-never seen so much might
Fight for-what I know is right
What up-you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me
Stand up-we'll all sing along
Together-ain't nothin' as strong
Won't quit-we ain't in the wrong, you can't bring me
You can't bring me down!
So why you trying to bring me
So why you trying to bring
Well you can't bring me down

Just cause you don't understand what's going on
...don't mean it don't make no sense
And just cause you don't like it,
...don't mean it ain't no good
And let me tell you something
Before you go taking a walk in my world,
...you better take a look at the real world
Cause this ain't no Mr. Rogers Neighborhood
Can you say ""feel like shit?""
Yea maybe sometimes I do feel like shit
I ain't happy about it, but I'd rather feel like shit
...than be full of shit!
And if I offended you, Oh I'm sorry
But, maybe you needed to be offended
But here's my apology and one more thing...Fuck you!
Cause you can't bring me down

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just want to know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray

Too scared to think what will bring tomorrow

Well I've got a little story to tell
About a little red-assed punk that came from Hell
He said Satan's been lookin especially for me
He said Satan's got a paper gonna set your body free
He said power and glory, bitches for screwin'
All in your name and all for you today

Oh yeah
Power and fame, all in your name
All the gold and bitches you ever could have

Oh yeah
You'll have power, fame, all in your name
All that you want, all that you need
Everything that you ever could read
Anything anything that you ever would need
Well sign the paper that's all you do
Sign the paper it's ready too
Anything there it's all for you
Well this is all you got to do

So I looked him in the eye and I said
""Fuck you you little red-assed goblined-breathed horned-he'd motherfucker!""
'Cause I don't care too much about gold
And I don't really give a fuck about what you've been told

It's like I concentrate on it real hard but it just doesn't work out

But then again I was thinking about nothing
And then my mom came in and I didn't even know she was there she called my name
And I didn't even hear it, and then she started screaming: MIKE! MIKE!
And I go: What, what's the matter?
And she goes: What's the matter with you?
I go: There's nothing wrong mom

Why don't you get me a Pepsi

She goes: No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!
I go: Mom just give me a Pepsi, please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me

They go:
Me and your mom have been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of problems,
You've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody,
We're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere
Where you could get the help that you need
And I go: Wait, what are you talking about, we decided!?
My best interest?! How do you know what's my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'm crazy?
When I went to your schools, I went to your churches,
I went to your institutional learning facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy?

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead

And you found a better fuckin' way, not just a fuckin' excuse
To complain. And beware of people who try to use you as

Tell me some more-Turned her over and saw the tire tracks on her head
Then what-That's when I realized she was dead

her body was minced meat
Bust crawling on her arms

But I'll live forever so it's not really goodbye

In the blindingly brilliant pure white

My soul rises separates from my body

I've gone to heaven

And nobody nears, nobody hears, nobody hears, nobody hears",Nobody Hears [Album Version] [Version],2016
Suicidal Tendencies,"Never good at talking, so many things I couldn't say
But those thoughts never went away
And I'm sure you remember, said that all I wanted was sympathy
Now add this to your memory

Too many times I felt so sad and lonely
Too many times I needed someone there
Too many times I tried to tell you something
Too many times it seemed like no one cared

And I don't like asking and it's not easy to say
I never learned how to pray
So if you have a moment it means
So much to me oh can't you see
If you'd just say a prayer for me

Too many times I didn't even have a second
Too many times you thought I was much too strong
Too many times you said the feeling wouldn't last forever
Too many times I proved you so damn wrong

When you saw the changes thought they'd go away
Do you still remember that day
I can't really fault you only have myself to blame
But do you still feel the same

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
But I waited so long for
Someone to take my hand, and say they understand
And I waited so long for
Someone to show the way to make a better day
And I waited so long for
Someone to spare a kiss for the love I miss

And I waited so long for you to look me in the eye
And say it's worth another try
But you keep me waiting waiting too many times
You keep me waiting waiting too many times

Many times
You keep me waiting
Many times, many times",One Too Many Times [Album Version] [Version],2016
Suicidal Tendencies,"Lights, camera, silence on the set
Tape rolling, 3, 2, 1, action
Welcome to the Church of Suicidal
We'll have a sermon and a wonderful recital

But before we go on there's something I must mention
An important message I must bring to your attention
I was in meditation and prayer last night
I was awakened by a shining bright light

Overhead a glorious spirit
He gave me a message and you all need to hear it
""Send me your money,"" that's what he said
He said to ""Send me your money""

Now if you can only send a dollar or two
There ain't a hell of a lot I can do for you
But if you want to see heaven's door
Make out a check for five hundred or more

""Send me your money""
Do you hear what I said?
""Send me your money""

Now give me some bass, umm, yeah, that's how he likes it
Now give me some silence, for all you sinners
Now give me some bass, yea that was funky
Now take them on home Brother Clark, send me your money

Here comes another con hiding behind a collar
His only god is the almighty dollar
He ain't no prophet, he ain't healer
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer

Send me your money
Send it, you got to send it
Send me your money

You hear what I'm saying?
""Send it, send it
Send me your money""

How much you give is your own choice
But to me it is the difference between a Porsche and a Rolls Royce
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket
'Cause it makes me feel so good to watch my profits rocket

Send me your money

Now dig in deep, dig real deep into your pocket
I want you to make it hurt, we'll take cash, we'll take checks
We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them

So whose gonna be the next king of the fakers
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker?
See my momma, she didn't raise no fool
'Cause you can't put a price on a miracle
Amen",Send Me Your Money [Album Version] [Version],2016

Suidakra,"I see a hammer smashed upon
A burning shield

Nightfall came to join me
And with it a nameless fear
I ran away through woods of stone
I never felt so alone

Always looking behind
A fear undefined
But I was feeling strong as I see

It's slowly coming into sight
I prepared to fight
With giant leaps it came upon me

To chain my body
To blaze a trail
Through my valour
To take my gods and my freedom away

When eve was fallin' I was almost crawlin' - my fate was sealed
Desperately I was fighting and untiringly I stroke back
I stood my ground with a blackened shield
Nothing would beat me
Nothing would withstand my grim attack
With my beckoning spear - And a blackened shield

Death is all around me
But at least I am free

Chain my body
And blaze a trail
Through my valour
You won't take my freedom away

See the winter is coming
Falling leaves dance to a silent tune
I'll take their hands I'll make them stand
When they're all alone
Years passed and the dawn of light
Spread through time to leave tales behind

The Queen of witches
Gathered the wisdom
For a year and a day
Gwion takes care of the cauldron

The spell is broken
Flown into the youth
They're hunting and chasing
Through the hills and braes

The queen of witches
Swallowed the young lad
So in year and a day
Taliesin the wise rose from the dead

[Chorus:]
Praise the one who breaks the circle
The one who dyes all grey away
Laud the army of dwarves and elves
Companions for the final day

Now see the man in legends veiled
A wise, a brave, of fortune hailed
Now hear the man and his flaming rhyme
Divinely anthems for glorious times

The king of mortal
And the source of wisdom
For a year and a day
Taliesin's the guard of the cauldron

[Chorus]


5. To Rest in Silence

[Music & Lyrics by Suidakra]

Fear his words
Creating worlds
For now and ever a living memory

Holding the crown
He reigns all alone
One man, one will but no destiny

Straight through the memories of woe
Into the fields of buried glee
Here the wilting dreams below
Source and ending of this story

Fall down to your knees to adore the lie
Fill the power and right to reign in violence
Time and failure have sharpened our mind
Disarmed and voicless it finally has to rest in silence

Hear the tales of thousands and one death
Of revange and wreath
See the veils which cover our mind
Silently making us blind

Silentium est aurum
Step back to where it once began
Silentium est aurum
The adornment in our requiem

So die in lies...

He's creeping through the dephts of living
Holding out until the end
No remorse and no forgiving
All he learned is to pretend

Oh bah mince alors, si t’es seul, prends tes jambes à ton cou
Ne reste pas dans l’bois, des sans-papiers pourraient vendre ton boule
Et puis fais des grands pas dans l’escalier, n’y traîne pas beaucoup
Tous les démons sont sous des mensonges, tous les démons sont choux

Oui, c’est bien Suik’On Blaze, et ton fiston bave
Si tu bois mes paroles, tu vas puer d’la gueule
Ecoute la métaphore, c’est comme snifer d’la colle

Le temps passe et n’attend pas, t’es plus proche du trépas qu’tu n’le penses
Si tu danses avec le Diable, p't-être que Dieu t’fera une demande
Justement, le pacte est signé à ta naissance
Et tu verras qu’l’humanité, dans ton anus, glissera juste le gland
Juste le gland? Oui, juste le gland, mais les keufs mettront plus de doigts
Car, si t’es vraiment con, p’tit, sache qu’ils le sont plus que toi
Plus de lois, plus de tarés. Plus de tarés, plus de lois :
Bienvenue dans un monde où toutes les putes se croisent, mais t’en as rien à foutre
La vérité, c’est ça ; tout s'résume à des bites et des chattes
À débiter des cartes de crédit, tu rêves de strass et d’paillettes
Tu vas sniffer des traces
Et fumer des spliffs
Tu diras que tu niques l’Etat, mais c’est lui qui t'biffle, oui
Demande à Wikileaks! Et tu trouveras malin de porter des armes pour venger tes amis
Tes amis, c’est qui? C'est quoi? Ceux qui t'balancent des bises, des fois?
Ou bien ceux qui aiguisent les lames quand s’agitent les flammes de la fin de la partie?
Les enfants de la patrie sont partis, tu les trouveras sur Google
En attendant, le Diable gambade dans le noir et, toi, t’es tout seul

Up in a nest
You've earned the right
To take a rest
You've sung for us for
Oh so long
So sit back now and
Hear our song

If you're a robin, hawk or owl
Pigeon, crow or waterfowl
Sparrow, duck or cockatoo
Hey, listen up! This song's
For you
Sing it!

On s'est battus sous les draps
Hey, elle pose nue sous l'orage
Dans le labo je l'embrasse
Elle me coupe dans le montage, perdu dans un mirage
Elle voulait voir mon corps pour son album d'images
Elle pose nue sous l'orage
C'est ma copie c'est mon scan
Je la retouche dans le noir
Sa peau en écran géant le soir

J'ai fait cauchemar où elle me dévore
Se transforme en méduse dans les entrailles
Échoué dans le décor après ce que j'inhale
J'ai flashé sur sa poitrine, sa nuque et sa taille
Éclaté dans le bain, je fais des pâtes, file en vitesse, change de sapes
Je veux la peindre, ou la photographier sous absinthe
Ouah! Elle m'a tranché à la gorge
Je l'espionne comme un fantôme à la morgue
Elle voit un Van Gogh ou un Manet, des poèmes et des pavés, oh-oh
Foncedé à l'opium dans les travées
Allongée sur le sol, trou noir de l'instant
Les yeux vers le ciel, le regard absent
Ses lèvres format, cinémascope, elle et moi

Les mains sur sa chair, j'ai flashé dans le noir
Intéressé par son art, on a shooting ce soir
Amour mort, toujours en vie
Enterré dans ma tête, magnifique sur-cadré par la fenêtre
Laissez-moi hors champ, on déchire le fond blanc
Accrochée au barreau, allongée sur le bureau
Cette chimère est spéciale, dans mon espace vital
Sensuelle, heureuse, coupable
Elle s'assume, elle est connue, poupée vaudou décousue

Would you still remain the same
Or live your life, so shallow
And take it for granted everyday

So take away tomorrow
And tell me again why we blame
Why we waste all our time
With bullshit and pride
Time may not wait another day

Ooh, ooh

So again, years grow back
So many tears I cried
Now that we're through
I'll still honor you
And harmlessly swallow my pride

Its time to fall away
Its time to separate
And maybe we'll be alright
Its time to fall away, and baby
Maybe we'll be alright
Life is but the memories we've created
For all those too, remember you and celebrate our life

If all that we are
Is all that we've been
These bridges were built in vain

Can we get to that place
With dignity and grace
And live with all that remains

Its time to fall away
Its time to separate
And maybe we'll be alright
Its time to fall away, and baby
Maybe we'll be alright
Life is but the memories we've created
For all those too, remember you and celebrate our life

Its time to fall away
It's time to separate and fly

Seven years gone by!
For seven years I've tried to make it
But how long can I take it
It's time to fly
Seven Years gone by!

If there was no tomorrow
Would you still retain all your hate
Or live your life with no one to spite
And free your spirit again

Its time to fall away
Its time to separate
And maybe we'll be alright
Its time to fall away, and baby

Afraid to walk the line, again

That I'm weaker today than I was yesterday

",Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else But Me),1990
Sully Mason,"Playmate come out and play with me
And bring your dollies three,
Climb up my apple tree,
Look down my rain barrel,
Slide down my cellar door,
And we'll be jolly friends forever more

She couldn't come out and play,
It was a sunny day
With tearful eye, she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say,

I'm sorry, playmate,
I cannot play with you
My dollies have the flu,
Ain't got no rain barrel,
Ain't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends, forever more",Playmates,2013
Sulpher,"Down in the park
Where the mach-men meet the machines
And play 'kill-by-numbers'
Down in the park with a friend called five
I was in a car crash
Or was it the war
But I've never been quite the same
Little white lies like I was there
Come to ""Zom-Zom's"", a place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans
Trying to run
Oh look there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if he'd look the other way
You wouldn't believe
The things they do
Down in the park
Where the chant is ""death, death, death""
Until the sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
A different face but the words never change",Down in the Park,2004
Sultan,"I'm feeling it, I'm feeling a change
I'm feeling it, I'm feeling a change
In the air

To look the other way to get what you want
Throw out your troubles to find your song
Cause there's a change, a change in the air
In the air, in the air
Just one more minute here with you
All I give to have this come true
Can you feel it too
Can you feel this heart beating in time
Wishing it was yours but it's gotta be mine
Couldn't believe everything I feel
You walked in you saw me just there

Don't close that door, don't walk away
Don't shut your eyes, you can hear me say
I love you now more than everyday
It's OK

Give every bit to have you here
Give every moment to see your tear
Give everything I got from now til my last breath",In the Air,2011

Chez nous les anciens sont malades mais la plupart sont à la Santé
On veut des pépites d'or, on s'contente de celles du Sundae
La violence est gratuite, espérons que la paix soit soldée
Y'a qu'une lettre qui sépare entre être opé et faire une OD
Chez nous les petits frères, ont des rêves de projecteurs
Les galères nous remontent même sans l'aide de émetteurs
Y'a des jardins secrets et les histoires des premiers coeurs
Ah ouais on a menti, vu qu'on était prometteurs
Chez moi que l'illicite à décider de domicilier
Chez moi que tout ces types ont cherché d'quoi remplir l'cendrier
On a tous en retard, le Diable nous fait des avances
D'mande pas à une poucave entre quoi son coeur balance
Chez nous les 400 coups, les forêts dans les roues
On avance de pied ferme, des fois on trouve les verrous
Chez nous on tient les murs et c'est nos projets qui s'écroulent
Nos ennemis sont nos frères donc c'est notre sang qui s'écoule

Tu sais bien d'où l'on vient, pourquoi on parle comme ça
Peu importe combien, moi j'donne ça
Respecte les anciens, fréro ne déconne pas
Chez moi, chez moi
Souvent catalogués ce qui vient de chez nous
Les bons délires ça vient bien de chez nous
Souvent on s'fait du mal entre gens de chez nous
On fait avec ça restera chez nous

Chez nous y'a peu d'repères, souvent des climats de guerres
Mais on s'tape des barres, plus de fois que de crises de nerfs
Foutez moi la guerre, ou foutez moi la paix
Porte les courses de ma mère, par preuve de respect
Chez nous la chose unique, c'est nos familles nombreuses
Les cris des voisins, nous servent de berceuse
Chez nous on est des cibles, souvent montrées du doigt
Suffit de reconnaître que chez moi c'est chez toi
Chez nous tout le monde en veut, chez nous tout le monde s'en veut
Chez nous on s'porte l'oeil, sous forme de ""Meilleurs voeux""
Chez nous y'a les footeux, y'a ceux qui prennent le micro
Y'a des soeurs qui sont bien mais y'a aussi les grosses mithos
Ça commence en disquette, ça finit en pilule
Hier on était en classe, on finit en cellule
Les peines additionnelles, les plats traditionnels
Chez nous c'est tout plein d'anges même si tu vois pas leurs ailes

Tu sais bien d'où l'on vient, pourquoi on parle comme ça
Peu importe combien, moi j'donne ça

Tu t'reconnais hein? Le bruit des compéts' dès le matin, les barbecues sauvages à 30
Les cotisations pour les mandats, les lits superposés ahah
Jamais nos parents nous ont laissé crever d'faim, jamais!
Et pourtant le frigo il est toujours vide ahah, tu t'rappelles?
Les p'tits ponts massacreurs, les chasses à l'homme, les descentes
Les après-midi dansantes où toujours ça part en couilles, on se sait hein!
Les frères qui s'en sortent dans la musique, le foot, les taxiphones, les boîtes de location
Bref. Pour rien au monde j'regrette d'où j'viens frère!

Et j'me disais qu'en vrai, j'étais mieux dans mon hall
J'ai trop passé mon temps à insulter le temps
A vouloir camoufler mon peu de sentiments
On subit le présent, on regrette le passé
Chez nous on craint l'avenir, on se sent menacés
Les huissiers à ma porte, des factures dans nos lettres
Y'a que ma solitude qui perçoit mon mal-être

On surmonte les galères, oui on a fait nos preuves

Au milieu dl'a cité, on s'prend pour les rois du monde
Les soucis nous rattrapent, tout bascule à la s'conde
Oui j'ai purgé ma peine, à Fleury-Mérogis
Mais si jamais j'y retourne, ça fera de moi un égoïste
J'ai fait pleuré ma mère, j'ai attristé mon père

P'tite soeur ta vie est un échec car tu joues trop aux dames

Les matons me surveillent, la liberté en mode veille, khey
J'ai vu mon avenir dans une bouteille
Bienvenue en banlieue, seul le rap, le foot, le crime paie
La mort ne fait jamais semblant tandis que la vie simule
Banlieue Sale, S-Kal, l'histoire continue

La cité dans mon rétro, une villa à l'horizon

Comme tous les matins le réveil sonne
À peine ouvert les yeux, je me questionne
La vie en vaut la peine, tout s'additionne
Tous les jours la routine et ce boss qui me presione
Y'a l'obscurité qui me détend
La routine me donne de envies de détentes
Mes journées se répètent, je zappe les chaînes
Toujours les mêmes clips, les mêmes infos, les mêmes problèmes
Aller au charbon pour un vieux SMIC
Aller se casser l'dos pour un peu d'fric
J'accumule les verres et mon calvaire
J'pense que la France peut m'enfermer pour un vieux stick

Si j'te conseille mon frère c'est que je connais tes erreurs

Si j'traîne plus dans les halls c'est que j'y ai perdu mon temps

Si mes sons ont une âme c'est que je rappe ce que je vis, ouais
Je serai ce que je suis et sûrement pas ce que tu dis, ouais
Si j'finis sur le banc c'est qu'on m'a poussé à la faute
Et sûrement que j'suis pas dans l'coup, que ma place est aux autres

Si j'tombe pour outrage c'est que j'aime pas Monsieur l'Agent
Si j'ai coupé les ponts c'est que l'amitié m'a trop déçu
Mon ex-meilleur ami m'a montré les mauvaises issues
J'accumule les chapitres, c'est sûr que j'en ai tourné des pages
Si j'pète un plomb c'est que j'ai trop caché ma rage
Si j'te raconte ma vie c'est que ça m'fait du bien au fond
Si j'aime pas les conflits ça veut pas dire qu'j'suis un bouffon
Si j'réponds à ton clash c'est sûrement que t'en vaut la peine
Si j'envie toutes vos plages c'est qu'à Paname on a la Seine
J'suis soutenu par mes frères, alors pourquoi demander mieux?
Même si des gens ne m'aiment pas de Vitry ou de Bagneux
Si ça m'atteint pas, c'est que j'investis dans des fous rires

J'ai vécu dans les marécages où les miens ne servent que d'appâts

Tête-à-tête c'est dépassé, tête-à-queue dans les WC
Du son déplacé, j'paie ma tournée car j'ai tout casser
J'ai besoin d'un lasso, dans la violence même pour s'enlacer
Et d'une Thalasso, faut qu'j'ai la peau douce même pour embrasser
Y'a comme un trou dans ma poche et l'épicier veut pas faire d'crédit
En plus j'ai des ennemis aussi balaises que Riner Teddy
C'est la descente en Enfer dans mon horoscope, zarma c'est prédit
C'est la fin mon petit, moi j'y peux tchi, are you ready
Les dettes font mal à la tête, les keufs font mal à la tête

y que el idilio perdure siempre al llegar la noche.
Y cuando venga la aurora llena de goce,

y me quedo en un vacio
sufriendo con todo y amorio
te llama mi corazon!!

que se funda tu alma y la mia

Sultans of Ping F.C.,"My brother knows Karl Marx
He met him eating mushrooms in the public park
He said: ""What do you think of my manifesto?""
""I like your manifesto, put it to the testo""
Took me down to meet the anarchist party
Met a groovy guy, he was arty farty
Said: ""I know a little Latin, a kissen an a kai
Said: ""I dunno what it means"", I said: ""Neither do I""
Eat natural food baked twice daily
Fill your nostrils up with gravy
Don't drink tea and don't drink coffee
Cover your chin in Yorkshire toffee

Dancing in the disco, oh no, oh no, oh no
Dancing in the disco, go go go
Dancing in the disco, oh no, oh no
It's all right to say things can only get better
If you haven't just lost your brand new sweater

I know I had it on when I had my tea
And I'm sure I had it on in the lavatory
Dancing in the disco, go go go
Dancing in the disco, oh no, oh no
Dancing in the disco, bumper to bumper
Wait a minute:
""Where's me jumper? Where's me jumper? Where's me jumper? 
Where's me jumper? Where's me jumper?"" 
It's all right to say things can only get better
If you haven't just lost your brand new sweater
Pure new wool and perfect stitches
Not the type of jumper that makes you itch, oh no

Dancing in the disco, oh no, oh no
And my mother will be so, so angry
And my brother will be so, so angry
And my girlfriend will be so, so angry
And my dog will be so, so angry

Sum 41,"What's the difference of never knowing at all
When every step I take is always too small
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,
I feel like I don't give a shit

Motivation such an aggravation,
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
I don't care so why should I even pretend

Motivation such an aggravation,
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it

Nothing's new, everything's the same.
It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame
I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind

Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this years trend
and though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same but who's to blame,
For all those stupid things I never said

Motivation such an aggravation,
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it

The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin.
It's not meant to hurt you but let me assure you,
It's not what I said but intentions you've read.

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left.
There's nothing more you can't ignore,
And say it makes no difference to me.

Now that you're older life's weighing on your shoulders.
You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight.
With most things so basic you might as well face it.
You can't help but worry it's all just begun

So when you hold onto the past then you,
Will break down what little is left.
There's nothing more you can't ignore,
And say it makes no difference to me.

I don't want to hear you bitch no more.
I was better off a year before.
No matter how I try I can't ignore.
Every time I think my brain gets sore

What's so hard about good-byes?
I'm sorry I'm just not as keen
On planning out our perfect lives
When I'm only 19.
I'm happy to be only all that you see.
And I'm not one to learn to be the same.

I don't want to try and just be friends
Nothing's change my mind again
If ever there were thoughts I had they're dead.
I can't even think inside my head,
When I'm with you

I'm on my way, can't you see that's the truth.
So long, can't stay,can't you see that's the truth.
I'm on my way,can't you see that's the truth.
So long, can't stay, can't you see that's,

Well I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school

Attention that we crave don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing act your age

I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity

But what would you expect with a conscience so small
Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the Gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back packed and I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kerfluffin'
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The dentist said my mom should have had an abortion

Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay

Why get up in the morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do

Remember when we would hang out everyday
And we would rather not be told what to do or what to say 'cause nothing mattered
Never boring with slept in mornings
