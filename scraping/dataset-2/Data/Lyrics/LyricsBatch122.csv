David Usher,"So he dies and I'm the joke
A Play Doh mask a million miles to go
A suped up cock tease with a little twist
When sex got ugly I'd insist
Hear you'll empty all I've got
Fucking's over but I can't stop cumming
Still born dead or never born at all

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

It's impossible for me
Harder even if I turn it over
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
Hear you've taken all I got
Fucking's over but I just keep cumming
Still born dead and never born at all

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl
When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl
When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symphony of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease",Jesus Was My Girl,1999
David Usher,"Borrowed in black you are mine
Don't make it easy don't make it hard
Don't make it so simple again
So so easy again
Bound like a child you are mine
I can't defend you
I won't complain
I won't go so so quiet again
Go so gently again

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn

Promised your mother I'd write
I'd kill you quickly
I'd keep you calm
I'd make it all so simple again
All so quiet
Here once the morning was bright
But violence changes changes the light
And now I've grown so empty again
Grown so empty again

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn

I can be cold dear I can be cold as you wanted
Living is hard here
When I'm just the whore that you wanted me to be

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn",Million,1999
David Usher,"I'm so dead and angry
I'm justified to feel this way
I'm broken in pieces
The only game I would not play
And you might be angry
And you might have the last laugh said
And you might be waiting
That's your choice so take it all the way
I don't want you anymore
Your way
I don't want you anymore

I'm broken in pieces
And you might never know the way
The kitchen is easy
And I won't be the first to say
And I might be over
And I might be the last to waken
Weakened and broken
But I don't care if you sight
Moment's easier
Moment's easier
Moment's easier to find

And you might be angry
And you might be the last to take me
You might be over
But don't tell me that I can't be defined",Mood Song,1999
David Usher,"Smells on the air
See there it's crushing the final impression
The stains on the paper
Where words fell like water
Unearth all the changes that never did matter
I think it's beginning to freeze here

Caught in the rage and the fire of things
All the brightness that burns me
I'm fumbling through like a child in the dark
When the nakedness comes
I am shocked by the colour the glorious weight of your skin
Comes alive
And I never thought we'd make it back so soon
Might be nice
But I knew you'd be your own destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Here please forgive me
Could we escape all the bitterness piled upon bitterness
Held in the face of the things that I don't understand
Intellectualize over and over
This helplessness suits us
Funny how quiet has slipped to our corners
Worn all our edges away
You are watching breathing and baiting
Wanting and warming and cautiously waiting
For some simple signal to creep cross your conscience
Uncover redemption and oh did I mention
I carried you down to the St. Lawrence River
The banks running dirty the water's beginning to freeze here
Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning

Comes a lie
And I never thought you'd get me back so soon
Might be nice
But it's only if my own destroyer
Comes alive
And I always knew I'd make it up to you

I saw on your face such a curious grin
As I let go your hand
I was desperate to hold you again
But you're sinking so deep in the water
Outsmarted myself and so easily gave up what I wanted
Solid by morning
What I wanted
Winter by morning

Comes alive
And I never thought you'd make it up so soon
Night be nice
But I always knew you're my destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning",St. Lawrence River,1999
David Usher,"I'm the trickster burn so brightly
I still hate you motherfuckers everyone
Wrapped in glory bound so tightly
I still crave you even when I'm overcome

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright

I'm the trickster burned so badly
I still hate you motherfuckers everyone
Wore my sickness so politely
I can't be your everything to everyone
Void of meaning swelled just slightly
I still need you I still need you
Gone forever so concisely
I still need you I still need you

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright

And if you hate the world
Let's say I've been there
And if you hate yourself
Well don't go changing
All the times I used your body
Done my way can't say I'm sorry
Ripped the gloss off all your memories
Consequences so demanding
Bruised and beaten
Conscience bleeding
Sexually, sexually, sexually

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
And I'm saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
Let me go bright",Trickster,1999
David Usher,"Bound by the time on the clock
Bittersweet wondering the quiet transfusion
Hold tight nothing is complicated
Hold tight everything's fine
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simple's illogical so it be logic
I'm caught in the diaries with all your complaining
The curious scribblings of one who has everything

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful

Cherish the lies that you bought
Charming delusions gone crack in the fire
I know we might be mediocre
I know nothing's on fire
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simple's illogical so it be logic
I'm caught in the diaries with all your complaining
The curious scribblings of one who has everything

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful me
Unholy and dirty and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Unholy and dirty

You can give a try
Average to sustain
You can give a see
You can give a stay
Everything's to the feel
As the years go by
Listen to the tide
You can make a stride
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful me
Unholy and dirty and beautiful

Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again...","Unholy, Dirty and Beautiful",1999
David Usher,"Jamie's on the bathroom floor she don't know why
She's shaking underneath the sink can't feel a thing
She'd love to live a life she's afraid of failure
With all the voices in her head
Now what was that I thought I hear you scream

I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it
You're already
Don't you know we're freaks and creature
Wake up I can almost see the light

I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone left wondering why
I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone in the universe tonight

Alex on the last train home from god knows where
A million miles away from where he thought he'd be
He's got his suit his tie his drink his MTV
He's trading all his life away
You can't escape we're all infected now

I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it

David Usher,"Something ugly this way comes
Through my fingers sliding inside
All these blessings all these burns
I'm godless underneath your cover
Search for pleasure search for pain
In this world now I am undying
I unfurl my flag my nation helpless

Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your kings and queens
All your sex and your diamonds

As I begin to lose my grip
On these realities your sending
Taste your mind and taste your sex
I'm naked underneath your cover
Covers lie and we will bend and borrow
With the coming sign
The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape

Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your kings and queens
All your sex and your diamonds

Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core

David Usher,"Turn me out then turn me on
Pretty flower can you tell me what's become of who we are
Only asking what you'd like tonight
Well take America
Just shake my tits and ass yeah we'll go far

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can't try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded

Sell a little bit to you
A circus sideshow but the makeup's shining through it's not so bad
Is there anyone to know
Forget my politics just sex me 'til I'm done it's not so hard

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded

And all the stars are out for you
And everybody's hiding here
And all the stars have come unglued
But everybody everybody's changing
We're changing
We're changing

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can't try to be as plain as daylight

Always blinded

David Usher,"You came apart on me last Sunday morning
Chocked and indicted by the truth
And it's always tough when there's never enough
Of the good things coming
And there was never enough for you
There was never enough for you

I can't see you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore

Got excited when I thought that we would last
Twisted inside out 'til we were drowning
From the first attack we could never go back so we just keep on coming
But I was never enough for you
Was there ever enough for you

Baby well you know I felt the same

Why's it always feel like, feel like
It feels like rain

David Usher,"You had to lose
A funny thing the part we can't play
I'd love to offer you with all the blame
But now we have to choose
Another round for all my friends and me
Another poke at sensibility
We've found out

Why are we floundering
I'm drowning in the reveler's sin
I've taken you up on your offerings
I don't even know it's good bye

You had to lose
Always knew that we weren't quite the same
I blew it up with everyone who ever knew me
Had to change
A revidescent light to shine the way
And we're not always following the same way out now

I've taken you up on your offerings

David Usher,"Did you feel small today when everyone had gone
'Cause I was beaten up and jaded by the news
And underneath the skin the truth is breaking through
So they just sewed me up and spit me out

Had to stop to rewind my memory

David Usher,"Well I woke up last night in a technology haze
My eyes were all sparked
From this common malaise
So I found me a doctor who said he'd even me out

And as the day becomes night
And we only want greys
And the innocence runs out

Comes belonging and believing,

Living quiet days,
Walking through the world
Changing it in quiet ways,

Lights a spark,

And the walls can tumble
And the mountains can move,
The winds and the tide can turn,

Yes, ordinary miracles
One for every star,
No lightning bolt or clap or thunder
Only joy and quiet wonder,
Endless possibilities
Right before our eyes,
Oh, see the way a miracle multiplies,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away

David West,"It's painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive

When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat

I'd love to call him something, but I think I'll just call it a day

Or did you just sit down and cry?

Pray for the ones who don't know?

Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,

Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high
Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year",The Perfect Year,1996
David White,"They don't want me any more
They all say I'm through 
Well it's time they knew 

With on look 
I can break your heart 
With one look 
I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role 

No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

This time I'm staying 
I'm staying for good 
I'll be back 
Where I was born to be 
With one look 
I'll be me",With One Look,1996

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1990

Wandering feet took him on his way

Chasin' down one man's dream

Like an arrow straight and true

Sailing far away

Sail around this sound
Far away from shore
Come away to sea with me
Sail your heart once more

Join me in this simple craft
Welcome to my home
The things I'd like to say to you
Are better said alone

So, let your heart sail with me
We'll cast away from town
And we'll sail away on music
Inside this simple sound

Sail around this sound
Far away from shore
Come away to sea with me
Sail your heart once more

This simple craft I play upon
Is made from wooden parts
Its never sailed an ocean
But is sure can sail my heart

And if you feel the music
Then we've raised another sail
The ocean wraps this world around
The wind will never fail

Watch what happens when I try to make her smile

Because her car must cost twenty times what mine does

David Wilcox,"I used to walk down every road, holding out a golden key
And I would search the heart of everyone, I was hoping was right for me
And I was searching for a treasure to fill me deep inside
I was searching for a life time friend to walk right by my side
You know how that goes

One day I grew so weary, I could not take another step
I sat upon the roadside, hung my head and wept
And then suddenly I heard a voice come from deep within
And as I listened to the sound I found I was lifted by the wind

It said, you've always had a treasure living deep inside your soul
And you've always had a life time friend and now it's time you know
That the love was only waiting for your signal to begin
But the golden key you were holding out, you were always holding in

I used to walk down every single road, yeah
I used to walk, I used to walk down

When Sarah came back with a smile
Some things just brought her around this whole world
Back to our hometown main street mile

She's come from the land of the desert sun
To warm up this small town street
A shining medallion on sun tanned skin
The silver still holds the heat

It's closer to home than my own home town
Never so far away
So come with me she said to me
I'm gone to Santa Fe

She's got that golden light in her hair
From shining into the sun
She smiled so kind with her ocean eyes
And told me, I'm not her only one

But she said, I know that look in your eyes my friend
You need some highway behind you
So follow me down and I'll lead you astray
Maybe you just might find you're

Closer to home than your own home town
Never so far away
So come with me she said to me
I'm gone to Santa Fe

Well, this town just grew up around me
I never meant to stay
I tried to make my break before
But I, I never got away

When I'm walking with Sarah
I feel I'm set free
Like she could walk past all the guards
And say, this man's with me

Out past the street lights, into the darkness
After the last stop gas
Now all of those things that kept me here
Sarah can take me past

Five days a week, I watch the tube
Five nights a week, I'm watching the radar
Easy job with nothing much to do

Waiting in my air conditioned office
Down a thousand feet below the sand
Looking at the lines upon my fingers
Thinking of the power in my hand

If I start my day, my days are through
And if I set to work, my work is over

Who was soon to pass away
He said, ""My life has been so good to me
Now I've still got one more day""

Now he said that as he watched the morning sun
And then he smiled my way
Because he said that every morning
He'd lived his life that way

He said, ""I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land""

He said this day is like a life you live
It's never here to stay
Because your time is always runnin' by
Like the sun across the day

But it's like lookin' at the sunshine from the earth
The light does come and go
But when you're lookin' at the earth shine from the sun
It's quite a different show
He said it's time you know

That I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land

Now I'm thinkin' of the things he said
We're walkin' toward the grave
And I haven't lived a life like his
But I've still got one more day

The life that's in your hands

The pull was strong
Could it be that
Much time has gone?

One winter morning of a day last year
I heard a secret that I now can say
Concerning Jamie, who's past away

If you had known her then you'd agree
Her smiling eyes could make a blind man see
She laughed with innocence and she moved with style
Full grown lover with childlike smile

She moved out West where the air is clean
To study poetry at Evergreen
I thought I'd see her in a year or two
Till we heard rumors
That I feared were true

They never found where she went that night
The man she lived with said they'd had a fight
She left that cabin to walk alone
He kept the light on
But she never came home 

She must have gone by the riverside
The searchers say that's how she must have died
The winter water was cold with snow
An icy boulder
And down she'd go

Well I heard the news but I could not cry
I should be shattered but my eyes were dry
To feel no sorrow was my surprise
But the words came easy
For those last good-byes

Till I took a walk by the riverbend
Where once we lingered when she was my friend
I tried to melt the river of tears inside
The river flowed
But joy I cried

She may be gone from this life we know
She may have frozen in the ice and snow
But there's a secret that my heart can't tell
Except to say
That she's safe and well

Riding low with the spices of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all

Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening

'n if I find it's alright we're escaping tonight.
That's what I came back here for.

Won't you please waltz with me?
I feel like I'm just like I used to be
my heart is locked up here so quietly
believing that you hold the key.

Won't you please waltz me free?
The turns of our steps are untangling me,
free from some dragged around memory
and the rusty old remnants of fear.

And after 10 years,
I'm melting the shackles with tears.

I'm as nervous as if its still high school.
You're happily married I know.
But it's not just this dance that I'm asking you for.
I'm asking you ten years ago.

Remember I wrote in your yearbook?
Could you please waste some time on me?
There's just a few things I must tell you,
but that's as brave as I could be.

Won't you please waltz with me?

David Wilcox,"Would you like to meet in SoHo?
This is David. Oh, I don't know
Just talk of how New York has been
Yes, it's easy to imagine,
I've healed a lot since then
I think that we could walk away as friends

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

I could be there by your night,
Which is my morning
Right now, I'm still at Heath-row at the gate
Well, yes, of course I'm bragging
But didn't it sound great 
To fly across the ocean for a dinner date?

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

Sure, I've been in town before,
But never quite so quickly
And never from a place so far away
But if this color-carbon ticket
Says that I can fly the ocean,
Surely I can think of what to say.

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

It's flight 715.
9:30, but I won't be through with customs until 10:00
OK. TWA. I'll be flying over ocean until then.

David Wilcox,"She can run beside the stream in the forest
The wind will lift her hair
She can almost see the moon in the waterfall
The music takes her there
She can be wild in the summertime
She does not feel these walls
She can give in, look up, take a deep breath
Step into the falls

She's just dancing
She's just dancing, understand?
She's just dancing, dancing to the band

But when the sweet-talking hunter see's her moving
He's aiming through his sights
His rifle only sees a prize he can capture,
Maybe take her home tonight
Now watch him circle back around
As if he can't quite read
What the writing on her t-shirt say
She spells it, it says
I'm just dancing. Dancing, okay?

She's just dancing
She's just dancing, understand?
She's just dancing, dancing to the band

Don't try to track her trail, hunter
She is not your game
This is a wild-life sanctuary
And wild is why she came

You only hunt to feed your lonely
But you're hiding in the blind
So you're a prisoner of your own protection
If it's life you're trying to find

Tomorrow is the ""Big 3-0""
For my birthday present
I've got a place where we can go
It's a lesson in motion
To ride the wildest ride
We're gonna climb to the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side 

So let me ride in the front car
And you ride right behind
And I'll click my snapshot camera
At exactly the right time
Shoot back over my shoulder
Catch the fear no one can hide
When we tip the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side
Over the hill

So when the prints come back
We can look at that unmistakable birthday fear
Like your younger days are over now
And its all down hill from here

It was a happy birthday
You surprised us all
So take a look at this glossy picture
I framed it for your wall
It's the moment of truth
It's the top of your youth
The camera don't lie
You might be screaming
But there's a meaning
In the laughter in your eyes
It seems to be saying
""Of coarse there will be fear""
But this is why we stand in line
Spend that time
Make that climb
To finally feel the other side
And it's all down hill from here

We're gonna climb to the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side

David Wilcox,"When you pick a sprig of balsam pine,
On your hike along the mountain view,
You can wrap the scent in corduroy, 
And bring the mountain home with you.

When you sit beside the ocean's edge
And dream of what might come to be, 
Your fingers keep the taste of salt, 
From the castles made beside the sea.

I'm lonely at work now, 
My hand holds my chin. 
And my mischievous fingers remind me, 
And cover my grin. 

The scent takes me dreaming, 
To wildberry pie, 
And the wind hits my sails 
With the sound of your trembling sigh. 

When we work to make a berry pie, 
Lips can tell where we have been, 
Out picking huckleberries wild, 
To bring the harvest home again.

And on the way we sang a tune, 
What I said is what I meant,
Our love is like a red, red rose 
It leaves a certain subtle scent.

I'm lonely at work now.

And my mischievous fingers remind me,

David Wilcox,"They taught us kids in school between the recess breaks
That the universe just sorta fell together like a Big Mistake
It started with a bang that sent the pieces flying
Then it cooled and twirled into dinosaurs and dandelions

It was a Big Mistake to have eyes that see
To have love like this inside of me
To have lips that smile as I swim your kiss
To have minds that will forever every part of this
All the moonlight shrouded in the clouds above and
The autumn leaves and the falling love
The still reflection in the moonlit lake
All, they said, it was a big mistake, it was a big mistake

Now back to science class through the looking glass
We were magnifying little ancestors of our ancient past
Watch 'em break a couple chromosomes, wait a zillion years or so
And get an ostrich, a jellyfish, a kangaroo, and a Romeo

To have love like this inside of me
To have lips that smile as I swim your kiss

But he don't wear their collar

To be the love that fills you up
I try to pour on sweet affection
But I think you got a broken cup.
Because you can't believe I love you
I try to tell you that there is no doubt
But as soon as fill you with all I've got
That little break will let it run right out

I cannot make you happy
I'm learning love and money never do
But I can pour myself out 'til I'm empty
Trying to be just who you'd want me to
I cannot make you happy
Even though our love is true
For there's a break in the cup that holds love
Inside of you

Now I begin to understand you
As you explain the fear you feel
It's when you see me fall into that sorrow
That makes you doubt the love is real
Because lonely wind still blows through me
I turn away so you can't see
But now how can I still be so empty
With all this love that you pour on me?

I guess you cannot make me happy
And that's a money-back guarantee
But you can pour yourself out 'til you're empty
Trying to be just who'd I want you to be
You cannot make me happy
It's just the law of gravity
And that break in the cup that holds love
Inside of me

So if you're tempted to rescue me
Drowning in this quicksand up to my neck
Before you grab my hand to save me
Why don't you ask me if I'm finished yet?
You cannot make me happy
Not when there's empty inside of me
But you can pull yourself right in here with me
My misery'd love to have your company

We cannot trade empty for empty
We must go to the waterfall

David Wilcox,"We were there in the woods by the water
We left our packs up against that willow tree
We dove right in, keeping just what we were born with
Our Memories, Knowledge and Dreams

As I swam away from our possessions
I imagined that they were gone forever more
And for once I was glad that all I treasured
Would still be with me as I reached other shore.

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

After the blaze burned our cabin down to ashes
Where we'd slept warm, now the sky lets in the rain
I found the strings, frets and rusted latches
But I will never hear that old guitar again
These four walls are only in my memory
Where these stone steps rise to nothing in the air
So one last look and I'm headed for the river
To wash my hands and try to say this prayer

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

When my time to live this life is over
I'll tip my hat when I think about that swim
And of all the things that make a life worth living
That only come to those who dive right in

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

Let me dive into the water...
It's all I need....

since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,

Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.

Chase it right down to the finish line

David Wilcox,"It's the choice of a lifetime - I'm almost sure
I will not live my life in between anymore
If I can't be certain of all that's in store
This far it feels so right
I will hold it up - hold it up to the light,
Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light

The search for my future has brought me here
This is more than I'd hoped for, but sometimes I fear
That the choice I was made for will someday appear
And I'll be too late for that flight
So hold it up - hold it up to the light,
Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light

It's too late - to be stopped at the crossroads
Each life here - a possible way
But wait - and they all will be lost roads
Each road's getting shorter the longer I stay

Now as soon as I'm moving - my choice is good
This way comes through right where I prayed that it would
If I keep my eyes open and look where I should
Somehow all of the signs are in sight
If I hold it up to the light

I said God, will you bless this decision?
I'm scared, Is my life at stake?
But I see if you gave me a vision
Would I never have reason to use my faith?

I was dead with deciding - afraid to choose
I was mourning the loss of the choices I'd lose
But there's no choice at all if I don't make my move
And trust that the timing is right

Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light",Hold It up to the Light,1994
David Wilcox,"I got a weakness for strong chemistry
One touch - all my resolutions change
I can say this is no good for me
But I'm back for more of the same
High on the ecstasy - medication against the pain
Our bodies fit desperately together
Like a needle against a vein

A poppy flower is so beautiful
Gentle as a lover's touch
A touch is just a touch of strong medicine
And it's possible to take to much
We take it for comfort
To take away the pain for us
A poppy flower is beautiful and
A thousand poppies is dangerous

Oh no, I can't go back again this time
Oh but every time I see her that magic
Seems to change my mind

""David, I came to your concert etc. etc. looking forward to etc. etc. We were very disappointed we had to leave your concert because you had to play that song about SEX.""

The world is a different place

You stay slippery
You stay slippery
So the worries in our head
Slide away, slide away

The world will change it's angle
So the furniture will slide slowly
To one side of the room

As everything must fall
As we rise, surprising

Oh, we must slide into each other
And let this air that knows us, in
It's harder to breathe out
Fast as we are filled
And as the room turns, I will brace you
As you bravely give your all
To the moon-soaked wall...and wind

The air inside this room is yours and mine
It's been inside our breathing
When you reached inside my ribcage
And put both your hands around my spine

David Wilcox,"Somewhere deep in the Midwest
There's a middle aged man in a mid-size car
Driving down the middle of the road
In the middle of the night

He's in the middle of his mid-life crisis
And he just decides that he can't go home

So he turns the car around and he drives to the airport
He flies to New York City where he makes connections for London
Where he makes connections for India
Where he gets on a train to go to the mountain

To see the wise man
You know the one
The one with the answer for that hole in his heart

Well anyway, he climbs the mountain
And he sees the wise man come out of the village to greet him
He's no dummy, he knows he was coming
And he musters up all his fear and anguish
And he says

Help me shake this nightmare
The funk has found my heart
I need to move my spirit
But I don't know where to start

I need to fill this empty
But I can't find the missing part
I'm just down inside myself

And the wise man says, ""Ah, I used to think
The blues were strong because they're true
And when they come to get you, there's nothing you can do
But now I think that's nonsense and I've got news for you
You're just down inside yourself""

There's times when you've been hopeful
And times when you were strong
Now you say that's foolish
Like your happiness was wrong

It's like you've never seen the sunshine
When a gray sky comes along
You're just down inside yourself

And the middle-aged man, he'd heard some, you know
But he had some questions
And he was just about to speak
When he was interrupted again

Well, never mind the questions now
You don't have to be so wise
Hey, your problem ain't philosophy
So get it down to size

Right now it's physiological
In a logical disguise
You're just down inside yourself

But the blues is not your final judgment
It's no deep or evil power
Hey, the cure is very simple
And it works in half an hour

Get some sleep, eat some broccoli
Run a mile, take a shower
You're just down inside yourself
You're just down inside yourself
",Down Inside Yourself,1996

Stood by my bedside in shivering light
Spoke my name, told me my mission
I could not believe I was hearing him right

East Asheville Hardware before you go to Lowe's"", he said
""Go to East Asheville Hardware before you go to Lowe's""

""You'll help to keep them open, I'm worried they might close
From the stiff competition from the National Conglomerate
With the full page ad in the color section of the Sunday paper supplement
And stacks of plastic swimming pools and seven brands of power tools
And rows and rows of registers, all having nice days""

""But no, you go"", he said to me with light around his face
He said, ""You go first to that age-old place
To that old wooden door that you have to close behind you
To the wide-board wooden floor, worn down soft""

""To the real thing, a good advice, quality at the fair price
And know that they know how deep the frost goes here
I'm sure there's stuff you'll have to find at Paty's, Lowe's or Sears""

David Wilcox,"Fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

At your church they asked for volunteers
To make a presence in the park
That's where the wicked planned to demonstrate
And carry signs to set a spark

Someone behind you heaved a stone
That struck the thin man behind his ear
So now there's blood upon his sign
Which read, ""There's nothing here to fear""

""The wrath of God,"" somebody yelled
""Will punish all of those like him
But if you travel back 2000 years
I swear you'd hear this all again""

Back then they'd say
""These soldiers walk on sacred ground
This land's our history and our home
They have no right to be around
They are the evil force of Rome""

So just how strong this change of heart must be
That one that Jesus once described
Kindness to your enemy
Carry his pack an extra mile

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

Your mind snaps back to where you stand
Your church is here to fight a cause
And at your feet a fallen man
Whose head is cradled in his arms

Though his blood contains his death
And though the lines are drawn in hate
You drop your sign of Bible verse
And help the wounded stand up straight

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

Oh yes, the high religious still will scorn
Just like they did all that time back
They'll say, you helped the other side
They saw you haul that soldier's pack

But now how could you carry that man's sign?
In your heart the choice was clear
You didn't join the other side
The battle lines just disappeared

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border
",Fearless Love,1996
David Wilcox,"Was golden day November, a one long year ago
I came to stay the holiday into your mountain home
I came to share your friendship and sing those fireside songs
I'd like to say I'm sorry for what the year has done

I told you of a distant love I did not know so well
I could not say I loved her but surely time would tell
But you and I together and her so far away
Our love that night by firelight, we did not have to say

So time will tell a story and time will tell a lie
I never said I'm sorry, I never said goodbye
The love for you was in me, the tear was in your eye
The silence grew around the wound that tore your heart and mine

So now the year is cold again and memory is warm
I came to stay the holiday just one long year ago
I think about your kindness and what the time has done
It's time I said I'm sorry and thank you for your love

This is the story she told...

""Can I have another quarter?"" he said.
""What?""
""Can I have another quarter?""
""Why?"" she said.
""Uh, I dropped it,"" he said.
""Sure,"" she said, and she handed him another quarter.
And he reached out of the window there, and dropped it in the toll basket.
Up comes the gate, and out comes...

Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero
Johnny loved his camero, maybe more than life itself.

Oh it was no big deal, he was just taking her to the airport.
It was autumn in New York City,
There was a wind a lot like this.
It was springtime however, in Africa.
She'd been saving up her money.
She was going to go on one of these outward bound trips,
So he was just giving her a ride to the airport.
And around and around the airport they went,
Through that parking garage, looking for a parking space.
""There's one,"" she said.
""No.""
""There's one,"" she said.
""No.""
You see, actually it takes two parking spaces...

for Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero

He's a little nervous walking through the airport.
He's always looking back over his shoulder.
""You can go back if you want,"" she said.
""No, no man, I'll stay.""
And he did. He stayed until the plane took off.
Then he ran back.
But meanwhile, she was high up over the city.
She was looking down.
She was looking down at the lights of the buildings.
She was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water.
She was looking down at the lights.
You could see them crossing the bridges,
And through the little canyon streets.
Little tiny, diamond toward you and ruby away.
You know, those little tiny moving lights.
And she knew that one of them was... well you know.

Man, I've got to tell you about the adventure she had in Africa.
I think I should start with the silver bracelet,
I think that's where it all turns around.
She hadn't been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of
Took her under his wing.
'Cause she was sort of startled easy,
She was a little nervous about being out there.
The first time she got sunburned through her hat
She realized she was a long way from being home.
She had just left the group for a little while one day,
She had just went to take a pee,
She said ""I'll be right back,"" but she didn't come back for awhile.
And this guide, this African man went to look for her.
""Laura! Laura?""
He found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree,
Way off the ground.""
""How you get up there?""
Well she had jumped.
""Why?""
Well there was a hyena, and they had told her about hyenas.
They have jaws that can crush bone.
She wasn't in a really confident position anyway,
And she just ran, and there was the branch.
She jumped - one hand slipped, one hand held.
She was not coming down.
""He's gone.""
So now she trusted him, and she swings back down
And both arms straight, hanging from that branch,
Her feet are four feet off the ground.
Man, she didn't know she could jump that high.
Ah, but she does now.

It was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet.
It was the one that he'd always wear kind of between his elbow
And his shoulder, kind of wrapped tight around his arm.
It was a beautiful silver bracelet, and he bent it down to fit around
Her muscle there and she smiled.
So much so that it startled him.
So much so that on the last day of that trip, when they were getting
Back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport
To go across the ocean to go back to... you know,
When they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window
For that last little cheesecake snapshot
And as he looked through the camera, he had to slowly take the camera
Down, and turn his head to the side a little bit, look a little bit
Sad and say
""How you get up there?""

She was dreaming over the ocean
Dreaming of being home again
Dreaming over the ocean
Of what would never be the same.

Well he wasn't at the gate when she got into the airport.
He must have been looking for a parking space.
So she just walked through the airport, you know,
And it wasn't like before.
Now the airport seemed kind of small.
The airport seemed kind of stuffy, ceiling was a little bit low.
And everyone was getting out of her way.
I don't know - well, actually I do know.
Maybe it was because it had been winter, you see,
And she had just come back from summer.
And she was just dressed normally. Everyone else was bundled up,
But she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top,
Hair tied back, and a knife on her belt, and a big old silver bracelet,
I think it was the silver bracelet,
But everybody was getting out of her way.
She didn't see him 'til the backpack comes rolling down the
Old baggage claim, and suddenly there's this arm
And this voice saying, ""I'll get that.""
And she says, ""Hey, that's my backpack, gimme it. Where you parked?""
So he reluctantly gave her the backpack,
And she swung it over her shoulder
And they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk

And then, out of the parking garage and into the city.
And she had to lean out the window,
She pushed the button and made the window go down
And she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair.
Man, this is the wild place to be.
I mean, this is the place,
She has to lean a little further out of the car just to
Just to see it all, just to look up at some of the buildings.
As a matter of fact, she leaned a little farther back
So she could look back behind
And watch those big tires rolling on that pavement,
And then suddenly the window came back up
And she comes back in, startled
And sure enough Johnny's got his finger on the power...
...the power... the power window.
And he's looking at her like,
""Will you get your feet off the upholstery!""
The upholstery, the upholstery. She forgot. How could she forget?
Well, she'd been in Africa, come on.
She took her feet off the upholstery.
As a matter of fact, she took her feet off the upholstery politely.
As a matter of fact, she folded her hands in her lap
And she settled in for this ride.
I saw just a glint of a smile as she turned her face to one side.
Maybe to feel the plush upholstery brush against her cheek.
Maybe to see the lights of the graphic equalizer on the stereo
Reflected in the side window.
Maybe to watch that lone drop of water make its weary way across
That perfectly waxed surface.
But I think it was just to enjoy this ride...
This ride...
This last ride...

It may look to you like nothing much to see
But you should see the way it feels to me

Here's the treehouse I used to spend my night
Up this little tree, way up in my mansion
Jump to the first branch, walk it upside down
Be careful of your grip, 'cause it's a long way to the ground
You etter get a handhold before you look around
You can see into forever

Well, I guess it's not as high as I remember
It might not a mansion after all
But it was hard enough to climb
Safe enough to sleep
Big enough to satisfy
And home enough for me
It may look to you like nothing much to see
But you should see the way it feels to me

Here's the old man who used to be the child
So long ago, not so very long ago
Look at the memory, think of all those years
Looking through the sparkle of the sunlight in a tear
You better take another look before you disapear
You can see across your lifetime

So I look at where I've come and where I'm going
I will never be the greatest after all
But it was hard enough to climb
To get to where I've been
Love enough to satisfy
And life enough to live
I may look to you like nothing much to be
But you should see the way it feels to me",You Should See the Way It Feels,1996
David Wilcox,"Well, I'd be dead by thirty-three
That was my best guess
But hey, here I am this morning
Singing happy birthday to me

As I clean up all this mess
Because I'm still left alive
Without warning
In the big, boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

You can see leather-jacket-James
And Jimi, fan the flames
Their posters will always look younger
Ah, but they never knew

And they can't guide us through
The long stretch of spiritual hunger
In the big boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

As a skinny kid she knew
That she should never sell her beauty
But it's a strong narcotic
To feel the public stare

It's like a powerful dose
Of some synthetic self-image
It makes you feel so alive
As long as it is there

And that was how she felt
Not pushed by human hands
She was pushed
By the eyes all around her

So, she fell back into her past
Where her beauty mark would last
So, the camera could never have found her
In the big boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

Now, when Jesus told the rest
That He would have His way
And in death He would not be defeated
Maybe it was all for the best

For what He had to say
Because He would not always
Have to repeat it
Through the big boring middle
Of His long book of life

After He passed thirty-two
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is still coming true

Still coming true, still coming true
",Glory,1997
David Wilcox,"Time, this time
Finally the moment is mine
The crowd is wowed
I'm walkin' to the cannon so proud

The cannon fills the spotlight
So shot me to the view
My heart packed full of dynamite
I will fall for you, all for you, baby

See this is your big top baby
And you've got all your clowns around you too
I can hear that drum roll baby
And that means that the torch is to the fuse

Love, true love
I can feel it when I'm high above
But I fall, that's all
I'm your human cannonball

Always dreamed of flyin'
And now the dream comes true
I'm not afriad of dyin'
So I will fall for you, all for you, baby

This is your big top, baby
Yeah, you've got all your clowns around it's true
Why are you just smilin' at me fallin'
Oh, maybe this is keeping you amused

I was the one you wanted
If I could stay that high
If I could burn my sorrow like it was fuel to fly

The sound comes 'round
Now I wake up with my ear to the ground
I rise surprised so this is how a fool gets wise, oh

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
Your human cannonball

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
Your human cannonball

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus

David Wilcox,"I love your sense of humor
I love to see you smile
I love your sense of balance
I love your sense of time

I love your music in the morning
Your rhythm in the night
But it's your kindness
That shines so bright

Yes, I love your beauty
I love your sexy moves
But more I love your honesty
You always tell the truth

I love your vision of the future
Your hope that never dies
But it's your kindness
That clears my skies

Yes, I love your wisdom
Your knowledge of the past
Your willingness to listen
Your taste for what will last

I love your compassion for the suffering
And your solid happiness
But it's your kindness
That I love best

I love, I love, I love

David Wilcox,"Riding out into the night
You know why and where to go
She can't wait to roll you right
She called you up and told you so

Feel the wind now as it cleans away your past
This when you feel your future changing fast
Right now, right now, right now

Keep your mind back on the road
Concentration on the curves
She made time feel slow
She cranked the volume on your nerves

The town is sleeping and the motor's making time
Take it easy, hold it right at ninety-nine
Right now, right now

See the candle in the dawn
Lover's light is burning still
Need some sleep to carry on
Wonder when you ever will

There beside you she is breathing, slow and sweet
She is smiling as you slide under the sheet
Right, right now, right, right now, right, right now
",Right Now,1997
David Wilcox,"This great cold steel that bars the way inside
Was molten when the blacksmith was still living
This dead heavy door that's oak by oak
And all the way across is unforgiving
The inscription tall on that pristine wall behind the steel so rusted
Says, 'Love remains to break the chains of those who would dare to trust it'

Meet me here any night there's a secret church
That's gathered by these gates of steel
A gathering of refugees enough to feel
That we're warm inside with our candles in the wind

We're standing on the outside of these walls alone
The secret church feels taller than cathedral stone
The doors may be locked but they're just doors
Come be welcomed into so much more
Come be welcomed into so much more

Then the wind turned strong when the gathering was done
And the chains upon the bars began to falter down to the floor
From the center of the door fell the lock that was placed on the altar
The inscription tall on the pristine wall behind the steel so rusted
Says, 'Love remains to break the chains of those who would dare to trust it'

Meet me here any night there's a secret church
That's gathered by these gates of steel
A gathering of refugees enough to feel
That we're warm inside with our candles in the wind

As we're standing on the outside of these walls alone
The secret church feels taller than cathedral stone
The doors may be locked but they're just doors
Come be welcomed into so much more
Come be welcome, come be welcomed into so much more

David Wilcox,"Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the secret I can see
Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the key

I love the nights when are timing is right
It fades with the moon up above
That's when memories get made
Never will fade and we feel the depths of our love

But we don't have time for the stars to align
Let's change our fate with desire
So what can I do to get through to you
When you're worried, frightened, and tired

Show me, show me
Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the key
Show me

When our lives give us time again sometimes we dive right in
Sometimes you're here but gone
When your thinking of things to do and you let it get to you
Seems like you'd rather be alone

And it feels like I've knocked on your door and I'm waiting
You're somewhere inside but don't come
You've got your reasons but sometimes I think that it's me
You're hiding from

Show me the secret where you keep it

David Wilcox,"I used to pray for rescue by burning up my pain
That's the only kind of prayer I knew back then
It was a fire of desperation for any wings in flight
Like a beacon from my lifeboat late at night

As long as I was waiting under the empty sky out there
I would feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
I'd fear there's nothing to believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation that's my silent prayer
That's my silent prayer, that's my silent prayer

I wanna smash the windows, the congregation's asleep
I wanna feel the wind blow and let the spirit free
I can't, I can't stand to sit there where their God is pocket-size
I wanna feel what's real and will not compromise

This rage I blaze inside me into the empty sky out there
When I feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
I fear there's nothing to believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation, that's my silent prayer
That's my silent prayer, that's my silent prayer

She cuts 'til she's bleeding to scream out from her skin
And he tightens the tourniquet deep within
Friends fall so fast we call it suicide
You just scream in silence over time

Oh, this pain you blaze inside you into the empty sky out there
When you feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
You fear there's nothing you believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation, that's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer, that's your silent prayer

That's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer

David Wilcox,"Circus-boy, run-away, steely-eyed gypsy
Seems to be adjusted to the clatter of the fair
He says: ""watch your step,"" as he tears two tickets briskly
Watches her summer legs climb the stairs
So you follow on, tip right in, latch the bar, lean to
Feel the smooth touch of summer skin
Then it all starts moving like no one else can see you
Cupid pulls the lever, and the whole thing spins
You had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Suddenly your lover just climbs right out
Steps across thin air and leaves you there
Try to catch your breath, but the bar is tight against your chest
And the ride is spinning so hard it holds you in your chair
Spin
You had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Well, that shiny ride was just lies and skin
To lead you on; pull you in
Took you for a spin
When it lets you out, you find it's many months later
Deep into winter in a small-time town
Walking kind of aimlessly, one hand on a railing
You stop a while to wait until the spinning slows down
'Cause you had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Well, that shiny ride was just lies and skin
To lead you on; pull you in
Took you for a spin
Come on and ride on a shiny new love

David Wilcox,"Tattered old kite
Must have been spring when you got flown
But there's no leaves in sight
Left you there to swing up there alone
Tangled in branches, and held by a string
That once let you fly in trusted breeze
Love floated me, I know the way it feels

So I walk on the ice
The river is silent as a stone
It's the same river twice
But the one that we walked into is gone
Downstream forever, or so it would seem
When the summer rain so deeply flows
Love floated me, I know the way it goes

I can't work this key
Damn thing is jammed or frozen closed
It's a strange place to be
Trying to pry my own windows
But there was a second
There was a match that was made
There was a key that is warm inside your purse
Love opened me, I know how well it works

I can't work this key

David Wilcox,"Just one turn to steer your fate
Or wait for fate to spin you
Your trusting's fine but much too blind
Your compass is within you

These days pass you yearning
Like empty pages turning
You're holding out for something real, oh yeah

You can't play pretender
Because you still remember
Just how full your heart can feel

But how long the distance
Getting by and getting through
Your heart's strong insistence
Says that nothing else will do

But you could try on their distractions
And wear some empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
Some cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind
It's right now, here's the turning point in time

But just one thing can kill this dream
To compromise your vision
We find our truth or live some lie
It rides on this decision

Meanwhile those other voices
Hurry up and rush your choices
Try to second guess your fate, oh yeah

You can't wait forever
Gotta pull yourself together
Feel the time is running late

Well, this time right now
The turning point is here
So look deep, see clear
Soon your chance will disappear

Or you could drift into distraction
Wear that empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
That cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind

David Wilcox,"In the deep of the darkest night
There's a beacon of yellow light at the waffle house
At the edge of the dark abyss
When confusion descends like this
Deeper and denser at the waffle house

After the midnight hour
I am scraping the eggs and flour
From the napkin dispenser
Where we who have run from our homes
When the silence of sorrow won't leave us alone

And we who are out here this late
Be it heartbreak or highway
Or some altered state
When it's time that we slow up
Wrap both our hands around our cup

Can stay until the feeling goes
As long as there's broken hearts and dreams
And all of this highway in between
The waffle house will never close

At the waffle house
Under these cobalt skies
The drivers with bloodshot eyes, hallucinating
At the waffle house

If you're facing some bitter truth
We'll save you a window booth
And we will be waiting for you
When we you run from your home
When the silence of sorrow won't leave you alone

And you who are out here this late
Be it heartbreak or highway
Or some altered state
When it's time that you slow up
Wrap both your hands around your cup

Can stay until the feeling goes
As long as there's broken hearts and dreams
And all of this highway in between
The waffle house will never close

",Waffle House,1997
David Wilcox,"This is where the trail just disappears
This is where their story ends
No one knows where they went from here
But I remember when they drank a toast
To the route that no one else had tried

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

Around the fire, we told the tales
Of how they'd cut it close before
And wandered lost after the avalanche
But stumbled back to camp at dawn

But now it's much too long to hold the hope
The glacier ice can echo deep
I thought, I felt a tug along the rope
And it pulled me from my sleep

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

The air is clear and the ice is blue
You can see from down below
That curling up over the eastern side
Is a silent plume of snow

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky
",Western Ridge,1997
David Wilcox,"So we raced each other down hill on the sidewalk
And we raised each other, us against the world
And we promised not to bow, we made a solemn vow
To keep our independence flags unfurled
So when the battles of the spirit left us stranded
And each went hiding in our separate ways
But now carrying a candle to keep the fire burning
To find us here, in brighter days

Someday soon made a promise I will follow
Someday soon's why I try
Someday soon told me take this cup of empty hope up to the well that's dry
Where's there's just enough of someday soon
To satisfy

Now you have done all the adventures I had dreamed of
And I have run a different path, but just as fine
Ah, but both of us have missed, we haven't closed the distance
On the destination peace of mind
And though it seems as if it's always half together
There is no happy-ever-after magic wand
The lightning pulls the thunder, the distance pulls the wonder
That calls us farther on

Someday soon made a promise I will follow
Someday soon's why I try
Someday soon told me take this cup of empty hope up to the well that's dry
Where's there's just enough of someday soon
To satisfy

Now if heaven is perfection, I'll get my deepest questions answered
Like a child tears into wrappings to a Christmas tune
But in the big hall, let there be a bright, red ribbon
That stays wrapped around the mystery
Of someday soon

Someday soon made a promise I will follow

Someday soon told me take this cup of empty hope up to the well that's dry
Where's there's just enough of someday soon

David Wilcox,"Do you believe in signs that whisper inside your mind 'till you have to follow through,
Leading you home again to someplace you've never been? Well I feel that way for you.
For how can it be true, the first time I see you,
I look into your eyes,
And suddenly I knew you all my life.

Don't we have all that time: treasure that's yours and mine, and a place that we call home
Don't we have photographs taken a long time back
Of the seasons we have known?

I know it's strange to say, when we just met this way, but I look into your eyes,
And suddenly I knew you all my life.

Down in the dungeon where the weird are stored
All the different and the outcast sneak back home
After laughing in the bright lights all night long

I'm lucky to be down with the cast aside
Safe from the madness of the world we hide
With everybody free to come and go
Under the radar of the status quo

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother
Down here in the land below

Down here we see you looking in
Down here with your longing stare
Down here we got a feeling of belonging
(Down here)
Because we're not up there
Because we're not up there

So you want to get close to the wild and strange
You want to stand at the edge of the river of change
(No)
You got a hungry soul but a cautious mind
So you can't quite leave your world behind

So you come for a visit but you lose your nerve
Out at the edges of the bell-shaped curve
But I saw your soul when you dropped your fear
You came walking in the world of the wild down here

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother

Down here we see you looking in
Down here with your longing stare
Down here we got a feeling of belonging

I was only 4 maybe she was 5
We were playing in the car parked in the drive
And it all started off with the one mistake
And that was the lever of the parking brake

At the bottom of the hill we cranked it hard
Missed all the bushes in the neighbor's yard
And then picking up speed, running out of time
We drove right into our lives of crime

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother
Down here in the land below

Down here we see you looking in

When no one's found you
You're just sailing right along
That's what you're thinking
I've been bailing you out so long
You don't even know you're sinking

Wrong to try to fix you, and wrong to turn away
I'm guilty, guilty either way

I don't want to be the one to get that call
Some early morning
When they find you dead of more than you can take
I don't want to be the one
To dry your children's tears of mourning
And try to find some lie to cover your mistake
If I'm always here to catch you
Then you're only going to fall again
But if you fall right through the bottom
Then I'm always going to feel the blame

Too angry to pray
Too far down to get back up
Too lost to find my way

To try to soothe with hollow words
I've heard them all
What I need is just to know
I have a home within your heart

Just hold me close
A few words will do
We don't have to find the answers now

She wanted to try something new
She wanted to live in San Francisco
In a place with a view

She wanted the sound
She wanted the life all around
She wanted the fun and the action of a livelier town
But he, he would still disagree
'Cause he loved the stillness of morning
And the wind in the trees

He needed the stars
He needed to say, ""This is ours""
And look at a field and a pasture
And a road with no cars

He wanted a farm
He wanted a horse in a barn
He wanted a life in the country, far from the town
So they, they chose to stay
They found a place where they hoped
They might both have their way

Surprise!
But that compromise was a life in the suburbs
That they both could despise
With nothing of either, too much of each
The things that they hoped for were both out of reach

No land for the garden, too far from the stores
No new folk to talk to, loud neighbors next door
Though traffic was endless, no one stepped outside
An outpost of loners who've come there to hide

Why they stayed, all those years
The answer can't be found
But there they were, there they fought
And there they stood their ground in my hometown
In my own hometown
Wonder what I've made that far
In my own hometown
In my own hometown

..............................................

I've got nothing to say. You've been leaving all day.
Now it's time that you go, and let me cry.
You've got somewhere to be;
You're still waiting on me,
But there's no reason to say good-bye.
Leaves fall as the trees give up the view,
And lies will fall away, leaving you.

So don't keep waiting around
For some words to be found
Saying ""Everything's fair in love, and war""
The truth has changed how I see.
Now you look different to me:
You are not who I loved before.
I dreamed it was true, what I saw in you,
'cause that's what a dreamer does
But the love that I dreamed is not what it seemed,
I guess that it never was
So I will say my good-byes, but not to your eyes,
For the one that I loved is gone, somehow
For without all the lies, without that disguise,
You're just a stranger now.

One man trying to make his mansion finer,
One trying to make his house trailer note.

And he holds his hand out for what else you've got,

'Cause there's never enough.
No there's never enough.
I mean even when I've got everything I need,
I can tell myself times are tough.
No there's never enough.

See, my uncle Jon went to Reno.
He won about a hundred grand.
But he kept on trying to beat the casino,
And he played it right out of his hand.

So now he's back bettin' the ponies,

But I'd say the same about a gun
Depends which side of you they see
Some feel safe and some will run

There's so much fight you keep in store
Though in all of life, you've won your wars
And still you let yourself forget
As if it's thirty years before

Prisoner of war, prisoner of war
Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore
Bring 'em home, Jack, bring 'em home, Jack
Bring home both the mighty soldier and the boy

Something you just can't believe
The many strengths you could receive
If you could just call down your guard
Just let those forces leave

Prisoner of war, prisoner of war
Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore
Bring 'em home, Jack, bring 'em home, Jack
Bring home both the mighty soldier and the boy

And you're so strong, and that's your crutch
To keep alone and out of touch
To try to keep your heart from line of fire

So it's still trapped inside that war
Like there's a soldier at the door
It's time you told that soldier to retire
And bring 'em home

Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore

David Wilcox,"I have drifted down a ways along the shoreline
I just watched these ropes give way where they were tied
I could have reached out quick
When the ropes first slipped, if I had tried

But I was wondering where the wind was trying to take me
Overnight, if I never did resist
What strange breezes make a sailor want to let it come to this
With lines untied, slipping through my fist

It is downhill all the way to the ocean
So of course the river always wants to flow
The river's been here longer
It's older and stronger and knows where to go

I guess I'm wondering where the river's trying to take me
Overnight, if I never did resist
What strange breezes make a sailor want to, let it come to this
With lines untied, slipping through my fist

This is where I played as a baby
This is where I ran as a child
This is where my dad
Took the last breath he had and smiled

I guess I'm wondering where this place is trying to take me

What strange breezes make a sailor want to, let it come to this

David Wilcox,"So you're driving from the funeral
Through the desert land
You see something moving
In the wind so wild

So you stop the car
And you walk out
To the edge of the sand
And you watch it fly

A wind blown trash bag does a road side ghost dance
In the vast Mojave sky
Like a living spirit just for one full minute
Right when you're passing by

It hovers there up in the air
Up in that twist of dust and wind
The vortex slows, so it goes
Dust to dust again

Whisper those words you heard
""Don't be afraid my friend""
It's more than just dust to dust
You're mostly a spirit wind

Mostly a spirit wind
Dust to dust
Spirit wind
Dust to dust

Is this a sign to change your mind
Tempting you to trust?
Yes, you're bound to die but you're made to fly
Just like that twist of wind and dust

This precious chance to get this dance
To get to live this life and feel
This time and place, amazing grace
The spirit wind is real

Whisper those words you heard
""Don't be afraid my friend""
It's more than just dust to dust
You're mostly a spirit wind

Mostly a spirit wind
Dust to dust
Spirit wind
Dust to dust

Spirit wind
Dust to dust

David Wilcox,"I know that compassion is all out of fashion
And anger is all the rage
Grow up and give in to that cynical spin
That you see on most every page

We all know what's wrong with the system
And how the people are puppets and fools
And if they're not strong it will trick them
They'll get used up like factory tools
And kids just give up in those schools, yeah

But what is it really, that's keeping me
From living a life that's true?
When the worries speak louder than wisdom
It drowns out all the answers I knew

So I'm tossed on the waves of the surface
Still, the mystery is dark and deep
With a much more frightening stillness
Underneath, underneath, oh oh

And hopelessness always comes easy
But 'easy' does not make it right
And courage can look past that surface
But fear will still put up a fight

And when I get scared and scattered
And I don't know where to begin
Why even care, it doesn't matter
Why fight when you know you can't win?
It's easier just to give in

But what is it really, that's keeping me

David Wilcox,"There's a young man dying
As he stands beside the sea
You can see him smiling
Unbelievably free

Wind in his hair, light in his eyes
He looks a lot like you, you look so surprised
But he could send you on your way
With no goodbyes

But he can't go and you can't stay
'Cause in the years it takes
To make one man wise
The young man dies

Meanwhile you're sailing
As you wave goodbye to shore
You're anticipating what these new days
Will hold in store

It's the mystery of the ocean
An' now he's in over his head
This is no place for the young man
He's got to send you on instead

Still you're looking so surprised
That this change has come as prophesised
But the years won't compromise

'Cause in the years it takes
To make one man wise
The young man
The young man dies

And he was such a lonely boy
Yeah, but he could dream, all right
He'd picture you a perfect sunrise
In the middle of your darkest night

He could take a sip from someday
Like he had a secret well
He could listen to the voices calling
That a distant time would tell

With you in that picture
Where you're looking far away
Like you hear a whisper
Of the things you'll know someday

But back then your heart was hungry
For something hard to find
Just holding out for someday
But you've left that pain behind

He walked you through those mountains
Long as he could bear
And he'd never reached this fountain
But he could take you there

'Cause in the years it takes
To make one man wise

David Wilcox,"From Underneath

Too tired to sleep, too angry to pray,
Too far down to get back up, too lost to find my way.

Who knows what happened, I'm too confused to say,
And too far gone to turn back now;
It's too late anyway.

I don't need a clever confidant to try
To soothe with hollow words,
I've heard them all.

What I need is just to know
I have a home within your heart.
Just hold me close. A few words will do.

We don't have to find the answers now,
It's enough to be with you.

David Wilcox,"In the tears you gave to me 
I found a river to an ocean.
Concrete sky and a stone cold sea 
Came to where the emptiness cracked open.

Then all my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow.
But I found my strength in forgiving you.
I never even knew how far my heart could go.

I live my life beyond each death
From the deeper well of trust.
To know that when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love.

In this life the love you give 
Becomes the only lasting treasure.
So that what you lose will be what you win.
A well that echoes down too deep to measure.

A silver coin rings down that well
You can never spend too much.
A diamond echoes deeper still

David Wilcox,"There's a guitar here in the window
I'd like to play before it's sold
It's such a classic, mint condition,
Great shape for one this old
Now all these axes have their stories
Of the gigs that they have seen
But, when this one sold the first time
I was seventeen

Of course, back then, I didn't want it
It was way too new for me
I needed something old and righteous
With it's own authority
So the first guitar I ever bought
Was twice as old as me
'cause it's life was filled with music
As I dreamed that mine might be
I played that thing a thousand nights
And traded it away
For something slightly newer
That was easier to play

But now lately I buy new guitars
They're shiny as a hearse
I still like the look of road-wear
But the roles have been reversed

And now this this is a classic
That I still don't need to buy
Yeah, the old ones have their stories
But by now,
So do I",Guitar Shopping,2000

Looking at the x-ray you cried in fear
To see the bones you walked upon were shattered
A year ago you crashed on this bridge right here
But we can run back home today, you were made that way

You're stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places

I found my own apartment, a broken man
'Cause I did not have the right to stand beside you
But trust grows slowly but here we stand
In the place I know is true, all my vows to you

We're stronger than ever now in the broken places

Like dishes in the sink
Stuff I don't believe just tumbles in
'Til I don't have room to think

All my failures are on display
The broken dreams of yesterday
The stuff I should have thrown away
But I've kept it here instead

I've gotta empty out the inside of my head

This could be a room with such a view
But it's covered up with junk
Blocking off the place the light gets through
So it keeps me in this funk

These dark clouds I've stowed away
Just in case of a sunny day
So I could stand in the pouring rain
Of every tear I've ever shed

I've gotta empty out the inside of my head

I'd like to turn this place into my home
Instead of someplace that I dread
It's the only room that's mine alone
And I'll live here till I'm dead

I'll sort through what I have found
Stuff that works I'll keep around

And he was hell on your soul

You were taking control

Now you're breaking your promise
'Cause he's got you somehow

Ah, but I still remember
When you ran from that place
With the clothes on your back
And your hand on your face

I guess you're drawn to the fire
Until it burns to the ground

And you know I agree

Maybe you should write this down
You wanna keep a love together
The best way is to end it now

When you both know it's over
Suddenly the truth comes out
You can talk about your secret passion
You can talk about your restless doubt

When there's no pretending
Then the truth is safe to say
Start with the ending
Get it out of the way

Now, there's no defending
Because no one has to win

You were missing something that you need
The ways that you were too short sighted
Get easier for you to see

Shatter on the kitchen floor
You just see another human suffering
And wonder what the war was for

And keep the past a memory

Its your mouth in my ear
And you say come and I'm walking

What you whispered
Well it keeps me satisfied

Makes me high, whisper to me
Its a sound I will always keep

You just won't remember

What a fool you were in high school over some old flame
Just climb up on the table, I can quench the ember

Truth be told, this big machine does nothing
But there's a change that brings
A difference into all these people's lives

To free them from the past
That was their prison
What gives them passage
Is just the fact that they decide

You see this big machine is harmless
It just scares them shitless
It's louder than a spaceship

We left our packs up against that willow tree
We dove right in, keeping just what we were born with
Our memories, knowledge and dreams

As I swam away from our possessions
I imagined that they were gone forever more
And for once I was glad that all I treasured
Would still be with me as I reached other shore

So, let me dive into the water
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
And when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

After the blaze burned our cabin down to ashes
Where we'd slept warm, now the sky lets in the rain
I found the strings, frets and rusted latches
But I will never hear that old guitar again
These four walls are only in my memory
Where these stone steps rise to nothing in the air
So one last look and I'm headed for the river
To wash my hands and try to say this prayer

When my time to live this life is over
I'll tip my hat when I think about that swim
And of all the things that make a life worth living

""Can I have another quarter'"" he said.  
""What'""  
""Can I have another quarter'""  
""Why'"" she said.  
""Uh, I dropped it,"" he said.  
""Sure,"" she said, and she handed him another quarter.  
And he reached out of the window there, and dropped it in the toll basket.  
Up comes the gate, and out comes
 
Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero  
Johnny loved his camero, maybe more than life itself.  
 
Oh it was no big deal, he was just taking her to the airport.  
It was autumn in New York City,  
There was a wind a lot like this.  
It was springtime however, in Africa.  
She'd been saving up her money.  
She was going to go on one of these outward bound trips,  
So he was just giving her a ride to the airport.  
And around and around the airport they went,  
Through that parking garage, looking for a parking space.  
""There's one,"" she said.  
""No.""  
""There's one,"" she said.  
""No.""  
You see, actually it takes two parking spaces
 
For Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero  
 
He's a little nervous walking through the airport.  
He's always looking back over his shoulder.  
""You can go back if you want,"" she said.  
""No, no man, I'll stay.""  
And he did. He stayed until the plane took off.  
Then he ran back.  
But meanwhile, she was high up over the city.  
She was looking down.  
She was looking down at the lights of the buildings.  
She was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water.  
She was looking down at the lights.  
You could see them crossing the bridges,  
And through the little canyon streets.  
Little tiny, diamond toward you and ruby away.  
You know, those little tiny moving lights.  
And she knew that one of them was, well you know.  
 
Man, I've got to tell you about the adventure she had in Africa.  
I think I should start with the silver bracelet,  
I think that's where it all turns around.  
She hadn't been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of  
Took her under his wing.  
'Cause she was sort of startled easy,  
She was a little nervous about being out there.  
The first time she got sunburned through her hat  
She realized she was a long way from being home.  
She had just left the group for a little while one day,  
She had just went to take a pee,  
She said ""I'll be right back,"" but she didn't come back for awhile.  
And this guide, this African man went to look for her.  
""Laura! Laura'""  
He found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree,  
Way off the ground.""  
""How you get up there'""  
Well she had jumped.  
""Why'""  
Well there was a hyena, and they had told her about hyenas.  
They have jaws that can crush bone.  
She wasn't in a really confident position anyway,  
And she just ran, and there was the branch.  
She jumped - one hand slipped, one hand held.  
She was not coming down.  
""He's gone.""  
So now she trusted him, and she swings back down  
And both arms straight, hanging from that branch,  
Her feet are four feet off the ground.  
Man, she didn't know she could jump that high.  
Ah, but she does now.  
 
It was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet.  
It was the one that he'd always wear kind of between his elbow  

And his shoulder, kind of wrapped tight around his arm.  
It was a beautiful silver bracelet, and he bent it down to fit around  
Her muscle there and she smiled.  
So much so that it startled him.  
So much so that on the last day of that trip, when they were getting  
Back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport  
To go across the ocean to go back to, you know,  
When they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window  
For that last little cheesecake snapshot  
And as he looked through the camera, he had to slowly take the camera  
Down, and turn his head to the side a little bit, look a little bit  
Sad and say  
""How you get up there'""  
 
She was dreaming over the ocean  
Dreaming of being home again  
Dreaming over the ocean  
Of what would never be the same.  
 
Well he wasn't at the gate when she got into the airport.  
He must have been looking for a parking space.  
So she just walked through the airport, you know,  
And it wasn't like before.  
Now the airport seemed kind of small.  
The airport seemed kind of stuffy, ceiling was a little bit low.  
And everyone was getting out of her way.  
I don't know - well, actually I do know.  
Maybe it was because it had been winter, you see,  
And she had just come back from summer.  
And she was just dressed normally. Everyone else was bundled up,  
But she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top,  
Hair tied back, and a knife on her belt, and a big old silver bracelet,  
I think it was the silver bracelet,  
But everybody was getting out of her way.  
She didn't see him 'til the backpack comes rolling down the  
Old baggage claim, and suddenly there's this arm  
And this voice saying, ""I'll get that.""  
And she says, ""Hey, that's my backpack, gimme it. Where you parked'""  
So he reluctantly gave her the backpack,  
And she swung it over her shoulder  
And they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk  
 
And then, out of the parking garage and into the city.  
And she had to lean out the window,  
She pushed the button and made the window go down  
And she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair.  
Man, this is the wild place to be.  
I mean, this is the place,  
She has to lean a little further out of the car just to  
Just to see it all, just to look up at some of the buildings.  
As a matter of fact, she leaned a little farther back  
So she could look back behind  
And watch those big tires rolling on that pavement,  
And then suddenly the window came back up  
And she comes back in, startled  
And sure enough Johnny's got his finger on the power...  
The power, the power window.  
And he's looking at her like,  
""Will you get your feet off the upholstery!""  
The upholstery, the upholstery. She forgot. How could she forget'  
Well, she'd been in Africa, come on.  
She took her feet off the upholstery.  
As a matter of fact, she took her feet off the upholstery politely.  
As a matter of fact, she folded her hands in her lap  
And she settled in for this ride.  
I saw just a glint of a smile as she turned her face to one side.  
Maybe to feel the plush upholstery brush against her cheek.  
Maybe to see the lights of the graphic equalizer on the stereo  
Reflected in the side window.  
Maybe to watch that lone drop of water make its weary way across  
That perfectly waxed surface.  
But I think it was just to enjoy this ride
This ride
This last ride

Thank God we get so scared
We can't see behind this curtain
So this world seems so unfair

Look, imagine life some other way
Picture-perfect every day
Indoor weather makes this blue sky stay
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, but bring an apple a day
Bring an apple a day""

This climb makes us stumble
Ten million ways to fall
Our childish faith will crumble
So this world will break us all

But imagine life the other way
A cozy fishbowl on display
With no chance that we might drift astray
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, bring an apple a day

When you get there life is easy
Winning every game you play

But every day is just the same
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Same old re-run on some child-proof stage
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, bring an apple a day
Bring an apple a day""

In the land of childish wonder
Climb the fence and run away
It's pretty to visit, but it's hell to stay

But nothing you can put your finger on
In so many ways it's going fine
You couldn't complain, you say
And day to day you get along
But lately you lie awake at night

What are you missing? Even though
You're not alone, you wake up lonely
You felt this way before, you know it's true
It's calling you to ask for more

Like a message in a bottle, 'cross the ocean
Just to wash up on your shore
From deep in your heart, please, ask for more

A beautiful dream you had reminds you of the emptiness
Something your soul is trying to say
Usually you can close your eyes and not remember this
But it's echoing back from miles away

Only a whisper, showing you something you already know
What are you missing? Even though
You're not alone, you wake up lonely
You've had this dream before

That can reach you through the cracks around your door

The road goes on forever, the road goes on forever
As far as I can see

Well, so much for forever, and the promise of a song
Why save her list of errands after she is gone
Her bracelet?s on the gear shift, and her sweater smells like her
And still her music?s playing, as if she might return

And the headlights blur and sparkle to see them through your tears
And someone will find the wreckage, with the wheels turned to the sky

My thin coat against the chill

And my winter house was stilled

When I grieved for all I?d made
Out of all I had to give
On the eve of Christmas day
With no reason left to live

A deep sleep, dreaming of
The river we have known

And the River flows downstream

Just droplets of, but here
The drops converge in this stream

The gateway is that pathway
Where the weeds grow high
Lately I've been thirsty
But I fly by driving 'til
The teardrops all run dry

And the River flows downstream

He would raise his face up to the sky
The sunlight reflecting on the water
And she flew so close as she passed by

But that's just an old man's story
That I have never seen

'Cause rich men talked about the future
And big change was ringing in their ears
It's a one cry slipping into silence
It was one voice never more to hear

The clatter of the dozers
The smoke of the machine
The edge is getting closer all the time
The edge is getting closer all the time

So light, lightly on the wind
So far from where she'd always been
I saw as if I could have known
Leaving her home, flying alone

Gone and never said goodbye
Gone, just an old mans story

Maybe woven in a story

And God knows your native tongue

So build a bridge with what's behind you
The scattered pieces of your past
Build it out over the chasm
To the promised land at last

Start a bridge with what's behind you
And God picks up where you've begun
'Cause where you look is where love finds you
And God knows your native tongue

Sounds I wouldn't understand
In a local ancient dialect

You can feel it closer
A trace of a breeze that makes it through
I remember you said
It's almost enough that you could breath it

And confusing what it meant

She faked she was asleep
She had not known him long
But she was in too deep

He stood there on her porch
She heard his cell phone ring
And with her window wide
She stayed quiet inside
And she heard everything

He said it's dust to dust
He said he was glad
There's one man he could trust

She had heard before
In her younger days

He spoke of one more hit
She heard the where and when

Packs enough for one

Wears a business dress

Got that great big desk

To make your claims

I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

They tug at my sleeve, my friends say, don't leave
Why be alone on one more New Year's Eve
The party is fine but I don't get high
I only came here 'cause they said you'd drop by
Soon as you enter, now I remember

Love made a picture right here in my heart
I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

Some pictures develop slowly

Look what I found, the edges are brown
The picture of us in that old boardwalk town
The wear of the world, the edges have curled
But look at the smile on that boy and that girl
And there in our laughter forever after

Love made a picture right here in my heart
I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

",Forever Now,2008
David Wilcox,"A shining drop of water rides the river to the sea
With hardly time to live at all
It tumbles down the waterfall

And crashes through the madness, dying to be free
It hits the rocks as ocean spray
And blooms again in clouds of gray, but

Some things never change

A child is born to wonder and his wonder gives him wings
To run and fly and crash and burn
He fights the empty sky and learns

That only after falling for the deepest love there is
He finds his heart is finally free
Surrendering to gravity, 'cause

Some things never change

And all the mighty empires
Have all crumbled down the same
So when the blaze burns down to dust

We can sing around the last fire
This same old refrain
About the one thing we can trust that

Some things never change

",Never Change,2008
David Wilcox,"It will change you like a lover
When you dive below the reef
And see the phosphorescent colors
Shimmer way beyond belief

But when taken to the surface
All that color fades away
'Cause when lifted out of water
Living coral turns to gray

But down deep, it's so bright
That the light won't leave you
You've seen this sight
And they can't believe you

'Cause your words go dull
And they never could explain
There is just no telling
Where you've been

On the map it shows the mountain
But I'd never seen a glimpse
Of the hundred miles of vista
Represented by an inch

That was just a trail of bread crumbs
All their words set out so clear
But there's nothing they could tell me
That could ever take me here

To this view, this height
That the heart remembers
It's proof, it's life
It's the burning ember

My words go cold
And there's nothing to explain
There is just no telling
Where I've been

When this sunrise sees me
The first light burns brand new
Seems so easy
To tell what I've been through

But my little camera can't keep up
With panoramas all around
There's just too much view to capture
When we stand on sacred ground

Though my mind cannot explain it
My heart's filled up to the sky
I know words could not contain it
But I'm fool enough to try

Then you smile at me
And my heart is listening
Your eyes, they speak
And there's nothing missing

It's quiet up here
We can listen to the wind
'Cause there's just no telling
Where we've been

",No Telling Where,2008
David Wilcox,"Lightning cracks the darkness
And for a moment I can see
It's just a spark to start with
But I follow where it leads

I won't spend my whole life hiding
Where no soul could ever thrive
I can't live with just surviving
My heart wants to feel alive

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

I see the twisting cloud that's turning
Where the earth and the heavens meet
I feel the voltage of that yearning
For the circuit to complete

So I will feel no resistance
To the current that will strike
I'll put my life across the distance
Where this longing turns to light

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

It washes me down to my soul
When a storm of these tears pours
It carries me into the flow
That's what it's here for

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

",Perfect Storm,2008
David Wilcox,"We finally made it to the local museum
Took Uncle Lester out to see the sights
Beautiful places but we've never seen 'em
Though we've been living here all our lives
Ain't that the truth

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

I got a list of all these things that I'm fixing
I'd rather burn the place and sleep on the lawn
Our cozy home looks like a perfect picture
Only when I've been away too long
Ain't that the truth

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

Got tired of thinking and the obvious hit me
To find my fortune I'd been digging too hard
If it'd been a snake it woulda jumped up and bit me
Now I'm digging on treasure in my own back yard

They snapped some pictures from the rocket Apollo
We saw our planet like the angels do
Looks like the locals got a lot in common
But we don't see it from that point of view

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

",Plain View,2008
David Wilcox,"All the horses out of the gate and right away
It's bio-terror coming on with smallpox
Running third is mass murder and behind him
It's airline crashing and random gunshot

I know the odds are with the fate I'm under
But now and then I can't help but wonder
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

It's gonna be quick, it's gonna be fast
A ball of flame, a quick flash
An atom bomb and I'm just a cinder
Or maybe everybody freezes all of a sudden

When the weather changes into global winter
'Cause what if Yellowstone Park exploded
So much that everything was covered over
Place your bets in the reaper sweepstakes

I could slip in the shower or get mad cow disease
I could stop and smell the flowers
And stung by a swarm of killer bees

I read the paper and the headline said
Only thirteen shopping days 'till Armageddon
I got duct tape hanging at my neck because
The terrorist attack could happen any second

This could be worldwide destruction
Or alien abduction
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

I tried to move away to somewhere safe
So I flew to an island but the plane got hijacked
So I decided I would fortify my home but then
I open up a letter and it's filled with anthrax

How on earth can we all avoid
Colliding with that asteroid
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

I could live to a hundred and die peacefully
Of natural causes
Think how boring that would be

Out of the turn and down to the wire
It's exploding tire, poison apple and falling boulder
Out around 'em, out of nowhere and looking strong
It's the long shot growing older

I know the odds are with the fate I'm under
But now and then I can't help but wonder
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

Bird flu

",Reaper Sweepstakes,2008
David Wilcox,"It's the loneliness, it's the love you miss
It's the tears that a heart has to pay
It's the same mistakes, it's the time it takes
It's the years that lead you to say

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

'Cause you gotta be lost and found
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find
After this long hard climb
And turns that will twist and wind
Love meets you right on time

Every turnaround, all the bridges down
That's the road that I traveled alone
Just the way it was, broken promises
What's it take to lead a heart home

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

'Cause you gotta be lost and found
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find
After this long hard climb
And turns that will twist and wind
Love meets you right on time

Love anticipating every mile till it finds you
Love stands waiting with a smile to remind you

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

'Cause you gotta be lost and found
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find

",Right on Time,2008
David Wilcox,"This old car, was once brand new
On the day, that you were born
But sixteen years, have rolled right through
And soon you'll drive me on your own

Sixteen years is young for you
But cars don't age so well
My door hinge speaks, repairs to do
But I've got this life of tales to tell

A tiny babe came home one day
Through the newly fallen snow
They brought you home and on the way
I knew we had some miles to go

There were Christmas trees for all those years
And they shed their trace of pine
And there's drops of milk and your young tears
Where you spilled your cup and started crying

And the grass stains here are soccer greens
And there's sand from castle beach
There's a Starburst lost from Halloween
That fell down through beneath the seats

Back and forth to every lesson
Building what you know
There was something gained for every mile
Like a seed you plant and hope may grow

Well, you had your place  in that back seat
As you grew from grade to grade
Your time back there is now complete
When you're free to drive, you've got it made

And the roads out there are to make your choice
And decide which way to steer
You'll be on your own,  I have no voice
At least not the kind  that ears can hear

You now have your longest highway
Still in you to go
Yeah, but all I need, for all I gave
Is to see you live, so take it slow

",This Old Car,2008
David Wilcox,"All three brothers love their father and he's called them here today
To see these papers and these lawyers and divide the old estate
All three feel that they're the favorite, he loves each of them the best
And these documents he gave them will now put them to the test

So they open all the writings that will prove the rightful heir
To this home that they remember and the right to settle there
Their own sister is a prisoner, they don't see her face to face
They've not heard her song of beauty or felt the movement of her grace

She lives behind those bars of steel and waits for her release
Will she die or will we see Jerusalem in peace?

Each one looks at what he's given and he studies what he's shown
They hold their maps that show possession
Of this place they've called their home
At first they sigh with satisfaction when they see what's on their maps
Each one's given all he wanted but the boundaries overlap

Do you wish us to be brothers? Father, help us understand
Or do we each kill off the others to claim this same piece of land?
Do you mean there to be hatred in this place you built to last
And will faith just die a prisoner in the dungeon of the past

She lives behind those bars of steel and waits for her release
Will she die or will we see Jerusalem in peace?

Jerusalem is sending her voice
From inside the prison of disbelief
Stand up, you people of the one God
To bring about her release

We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days

David Wolfert,"Here I sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what I should have known 
You made me think that I could need you 
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you 
Lookin back on you and me, promises that will never be 
I truly thought we were lovers 
But now I find that I'm just like all the others 
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me 
Played with fire, felt its burn 
I would have thought that I would have learned 
I melted every time you kissed me 
Every time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me 
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me

David Wright,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair",Scarlet Ribbons,2005

Ain't got no direction and don't know which way to go 
Nigga save your soul cause we all gotta struggle or strive

Living in the battlefield it's all about respect and honor

With ten thousand shields and spears.

I was armed, he came in vain
For the time of youth was fled, 
And gray hairs were on my head.

in cui ti ho vista arrivare
all'improvviso il mondo intorno

e ruba l'aria attorno a me
perchè tra noi 
è amore eterno
averti tra le braccia e non stancarmi mai
cadendo in volo tra le fiamme dell'inferno

Occhi smeraldo
e quel vestito
che accarezzava i tuoi fianchi
un desiderio il più proibito
e dirti che già mi manchi

E'il tuo profumo che mi ammalia
e ruba l'aria attorno a me
perchè tra noi 
è amore eterno
averti tra le braccia e non stancarmi mai
cadendo in volo tra le fiamme dell'inferno

almeno un attimo di immenso
non andare via neanche quando penso

ti avrei dato luna e sole

in qualche angolo del mondo
vivendo un secolo un secondo
sereno contento

Di non averti accanto a me
di essere libero nel vento
come una rondine volando
sognando si

Per amore per amore non ci si può cancellare 
umiliare non avere dignità

dopo l'ultima scenata
ingiustificato l'odio che hai per me

che cos'è
è più gioia o lacrime

Ich weiß es gibt Props
Mike Specht komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props

Ich hab genug von dem Geschwätz
Und ich brauch für gute Raps
Keinen Text über Breakdance oder Fatcaps
HipHop Tracks sind mehr als das
Wer's nicht glaubt auf den scheiß' ich
Täglich reiß ich mir meinen Arsch auf
(Und wofür) Weiß nich'!
Nicht mal zum grillen reicht die Kohle die ich krieg
Doch wenn ich rap' brennt mein Herz und das ist mir wichtig
Und ich richt' mich immer nur nach meinem Kopf
(Geh ans Mic, kick den Scheiß für den Topf)
Du willst 'n Battle gegen mich, eins gegen eins,
Komm doch her wenn du dich traust, und bring deins gegen meins
Die Waffen, zwei Mics, geschossen wird mit Styles
Den Ring in dem wir kämpfen müssen, klatschender Kreis
Was jeder weiß (Nur wer rockt kriegt die props)
Doch nur am Kindergeburtstag schlägt man den Topf
Ein Diss geht an all diejenigen die dachten wir schaffen's nicht
Wer phat ist, wird auch phat, echte Kiffer paffen nicht

Holundermann komm' und kick' deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß' es gibt Props
Holundermann komm und kick' deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props

Ich hinterlasse Spuren in deinem Kopf
Wie ein Freerider im Tiefschnee
Und wenn mein Rap zu diesem Beat leider schiefgeht,
Dann ist es scheißegal, ich weiß ich krieg Props
(Kick den Scheiß für den Topf)
OK ich versuch's
Ich hinterlasse Spuren in deinem Kopf
Wie 'n Hund der an nen Baum pisst
Ich rock' das Haus, und morgen schon dein Raumschiff
Denn ich bin der Captain Future unter den MC's
An all die rappenden Lutscher, hier ist euer Diss
(Ihr seid mies)
Denn euer Flow ist sonderbar, wären Raps Titten
Bräuchtet ihr 'nen Wonderbra,
Spiel den Partyclown oder mach auf hart
In deinen Timberlands, scheißegal
Ab in den Sandkasten, mit Kinderbands wie deiner,
Tausch das Mikro ein gegen Förmchen und Eimer,
Ein Vergleich zwischen dir und mir ist wie Mutter Beimar
Auf dem Laufsteg neben Claudia Schiffer
Paff deine Tüten und verkauf dich als Kiffer
Wenn du glaubst du hast es nötig
Aber miss dich nicht mit München
Kauf' dir Maggi-Fix denn dein Flow hat lauter Klümpchen

Goetheplatz Mentality
Rock die Party, bin kein König mit Thron
Bin gegen Monarchie
Habe Kraft wie Kräftige, missbrauch' sie nicht wie Mächtige
Geht's um mächtige Raps bin ich der übliche Verdächtige
Ich wachs' nach oben will nach unten
Durch meine Roots gebunden für nur 48 Stunden
Verstummten jene Runden von Fachkundigen
Tief in meinen Tracks versunken
Wie deine Fans über deinem Text in der Bunten
Hast dein Publikum gefunden
Als superfetter, superhohler, Deutschrapper, Mikrophon-Schwarzennegger
Der Mund ist groß, dein Hirn jedoch ein Mikrochip
Dein Auftritt war ein Ausblick auf dein dein wahres ich, ein
Egotrip
Ich lebe in der heiligen Stadt David's, nicht in Bethlehem
Vertrete den Mob mit den Jungs die die Drähte ziehen
Die Positionen sind besetzt
Geht S1? auf die Beats, 58 auf die Raps

Master P komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props
Master P komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Alles klar ich fang' an denn keiner kann's erwarten
Ich bring den coolen Flow und da gehen alle anderen baden
Aber nicht weil ich spucke, meine Reime fließen von Natur aus
Doch nicht nur aus diesem Grund gibt's die Props
Ich hab die Skills von denen alle Rapper träumen
Sie heulen denn jeden Tag burn' ich mit was neuem
Irgendwie lieb ich das, selbst wenn es mir beschissen geht
Häng' ich ab, während sich das Rad der Zeit dreht
Ich kick den Scheiß für den Topf den sich alle reinziehen
Drum fragt mich keiner mehr nach meinem Namen (jeder weiß ihn)
Es ist der Fame der mich verfolgt
Gebt mir nur einen Beat, ein Mikrophon und meine Crew,
Dann kriegt ihr was ihr wollt,
Die fetten Tracks, und die kommen aus der Stadt die so verträumt
Ist,
München, burn' dich alle 97

Kung Schu komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props
Kung Schu komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props

Ich steh im Rampenlicht, alle sehen mich, und fragen sich,
Was macht diesen kleinen Scheißer so verdammt frisch
Kommen nach der Show, wollen wissen wie Freestyle rappen geht,
Was man als erfahrener Rapper abends macht oder trägt
Ich trag' mein kleines schwarzes Reimbuch immer mit mir
Und Freestyle Rappen klappt nur wenn ich mich konzentrier
Alle verstanden - Hör zu - weil es jetz langsam Zeit wird
Für meinen legendären Style des Rap
Ich bring geile Tracks mit Gefühl auf Vinyl
Ich bin der gegen-den-Strom-Schwimmer
Und sah leider schon manchen meiner Helden aus den alten Zeiten
Mit dem Kopf nach unten an mir vorbei treiben
Dein zwischen alten Idealen und neuen Maxis
Liegt der feine Unterschied zwischen Theorie und Praxis
Falls auch wir nicht so viel kriegen wie wir geben
Will ich die Straße auf die ich heute stolz bin
Später mal nicht fegen
Drum geh ich immer wieder auf Arbeitsamt
Und danach komm ich mir vor wie ein Fußballspieler der im
Abseits stand
Umsonst gerannt, haa, denn in Wahrheit fand ich dort,
Nur Alternativen zu Alternativen zu Alternativen
Irgendwas find' ich schon, und das wann und wo das wie lang und
Wovon
Ist für mich gar nicht so wichtig,
Weil ich weiß wofür dieser Ton in deinem Ohr
Ist mein Fuß in deiner Tür (lass mich rein)
Durch die Ohren in den Kopf in dein Gehirn
Und ich rocks, ah, PROPS",Props,1997

Davie Allan & the Arrows,"Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
It's a miracle in itself  
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Davie Allan & the Arrows,"There's a new sun
Risin' up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice
Cryin' we're not afraid to die
Let the old world make believe
It's blind and deaf and dumb
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
There are changes
Lyin' ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts
Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today
The bells may toll for some
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
The future's comin' in, now
Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long
There are new dreams
Crowdin' out old realities
There's revolution
Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze

Can separate the mountains from the sea

Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo

Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli

Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06

Told me you were through with me

Davy Jones,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried

I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Davy Jones,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery
But then why should anyone listen to me?
Why should I speak since I know nothing?",You and I (And Promises Not Broken),1999

Dawes,"Your mother finally took all of her money
And put it where her mouth used to be
Turning anybody's ear
About her friends that disappeared
And how she's sailing further out to sea

Your father's spending all of his vacation
Learning foreign names for all his fears
And the spirits he's detected
About the data he's collected [?]
Turned out to be just ringing in his ears
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Everything they're telling you is wrong
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Babe I think you know where you belong

Your sister's always mortally offended
At the mispronunciation of her name
Telling all her newest clients
That the ""w"" is silent
Before she turns them back the way they came

Your brother sends me all his latest poems
About his secret dreams of learning how to dance
He knows these hands are not for you [?]
Asking when you're coming through
So he can tell his supervisor six months in advance

You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Everything they're telling you is wrong
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Babe I think you know where you belong

Your old flame is still counting up his money
In a secret lair he built behind the shelf
When a chance at repetition
Leading out into temptation
I'm pretty sure he knows the way himself

Dawes,"The separation was symmetrical
They both retreated to their sides
Drawing lists of demands
And muddy lines in the sand
Trying out their separate lives

Most of the damage was collateral
But still inspired some debate
All the principles of why all the people we love
Are the same as we also can hate

You just roll with the punches
Until you can't feel a thing
You just roll with the punches
Aww yeah

The separation was logistical
Deciding what belongs to whom
How dying love manifests
In a rug or a chest
The decorations of a room

Every promise was negotiable
Most of all the ones they made alone
When she finally forgave
What he'll take to his grave
Learning not to pick up the phone

You just roll with the punches
Until you can't feel a thing
You just roll with the punches
Aww yeah

He starts existing as a miracle
A man of static right behind your eyes
That you filter everything through
Without knowing you do
A past and future synthesized

You just roll with the punches
Until you can't feel a thing
You just roll with the punches
Aww yeah

You just roll with the punches
Until you can't feel a thing
You just roll with the punches
Aww yeah",Roll With the Punches,2016
Dawes,"Everyone that greeted me, was moving slow and drinking fast
I was lost inside a painting on a wall
A pretty baby with a cigarette, was looking for a place to ash
Stumbling toward the voices down the hall

They had Thriller on the stereo, not the album, just the song
For two dancers all in white, that no one really knew
There were a lot of leather jackets, there was a haircut reading palms
There was a line outside the bathroom that didn’t really move

Some girls forgot their bathing suits but felt like jumping in the pool
Right after making sure the underwater lights were on
I was staring at a silhouette, I was blushing like a fool
Letting everyone pretend they hadn’t planned it all along

Then our host bust out of his bedroom, with his glasses slightly bent
He gets up on the diving board to tell us how he feels
“Ladies and gentlemen we’ve begun the initial decent,
And now it’s time to pull up on the wheel”

When the tequila runs out, we’ll be drinking champagne
When the tequila runs out, we’ll be drinking champagne
When the tequila runs out, we’ll be drinking champagne
When the tequila runs out, we’ll be feeling no pain

On the floor of the living room, I saw my past life passed out
Laying next to her handsome new flame
I didn’t recognize his face too much ‘cept for the grimace on his mouth
He looked a lot like me, he seemed to be in pain

I didn’t hear the picture window break, I didn’t see the rising sun
But I could feel the morning breeze
Then I heard her tired voice speak up and say “I think this party’s done”
She asked if I could drive her home, and then she added please (please)

Dawes,"Micheladas in the afternoon
Lie on the couch in a rented room
Watchin' Jeopardy without the sound
It's easy to stay down

Quick mistakes and long goodbyes
Hold-over truths and necessary lies
I caught a train that was backwards-bound
It's easy to stay down

Stay down when your mind has been cleared
And your trail can't be found
Stay down with your eye to the sky
And your ear to the ground

Down by the pool with all my brand-new friends
Re-writin' letters that I never sent
Declinin' invitations into town
It's easy to stay down

Slowly admit that you have had your fun
The girl you loved and every word you sung
All the profane that you thought profound
It's time now to stay down

Stay down when the smoke is cleared
And you name can be found
Stay down with your head in the clouds
And your eyes to the ground

Feel the sting of the final blow
What could've been, you don't care or know
Don't try to go another round
Stay down",Stay Down,2018

The stars won't come out if they know that you're about
Cause they couldn't match the glow of your eyes
And, oh, who am I ? Just an ordinary guy
Tryin hard to win me first prize

[Chorus]
Oh my Candida
We could make it together
The further from here girl the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Oh my Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise that life will be sweeter
'Cause it said so in my dreams

The future looks bright, the gypsy told me so last night
Said she saw our children playing in the sunshine
And there were you and I in a house, baby, no lie
And all these things were yours, and they were mine

Dawn Golden,"Took my hand and brought me down in the morning
And I was sitting, waiting for the telephone to swallow me whole.

I saw your face reflected on the resonant screen
And I watched your mouth moving like a tired machine
Trying to plead with me
Trying to swallow me whole.

It's been a while
Since I've been gone and away
And I watched your eyes reflect me in a terrible way
As you cast your gaze to the flickering hall.

And you knelt beside me and
You started to pray
And the whites of your eyes blackened
With a hardened decay
And you talked to me in a broken voice

""In your open mouth
Silence me in your coursing
Blood in my eyes
Dress me in your clothes
Swallow me whole, swallow me whole""

Your open mouth
Silence me in your coursing
Blood in my eyes
Dress me in your clothes
Swallow me whole, swallow me whole

Silence me in your coursing

Dawn Humphrey,"The queen of light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The prince of peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone

Oh, dance in the dark of night
The dark lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe

Side by side we wait the night
The darkest of them all
Ah
Oh

I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold
The seas of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget

The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red, ohhhh
Oh, war is the common cry
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know, ohhh
Ohh

Oh, well, the night is long
The beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black

Sing as you raise your bow
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night

The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back
Oh

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes

Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

Every life has a plan
Though sometimes the map is out of our hands
Every day is a step
Though we may not know the reason just yet
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
Learn to let go, and just let it be

CHORUS:
Let there be love
Let there be light
Let there be hope in the dark of the night
For every heart that's lying in wait
Let there be love
Let there be love

You are strong
You are brave
Though I couldn't even count all the way
There's a time to be still
Let the river carry you where it will
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
Learn to let go
Just let it be

Bridge:
It's a long, hard road to travel
Yes, I know what it's like when you lose your way
When the best laid plans unravel
That's when you've got to believe

Tell me there's something that I lack

Dawn Robinson,"Met a man walking on the side of the road
His name was Joe and his clothes were borrowed
When he spoke all his word had pain
In his eyes and his heart was sorrow

He walked for many miles in the rain
Said he'd be walking until tomorrow
His wife took the kids and drove away
With his best friend and moved down to Mexico

He felted he'd lost everything
Made a new friend named Johnny Walker
Often he cried about his past till Johnny said to him

Sir Times get hard
And Things go wrong
Though you stumble and fall
Don't give up just get up again

You can't complain 
bout the heartache and pain
But right there you remain
Till you choose to get up

I met this girl on 42ND street
On her way to work religiously
She looked me in my eyes and said to me
She's barely able to make ends meet

It broke my heart to have to hear her say
She had three children and one on the way
For her kids she had to be strong
'Cause things got rough when their daddy moved on

To proud to ask her family to help her
Cause her father always swore she'd be a failure
If it wasn't for her children's love
She would have given up

Times may get hard
Times may get hard
Times may get hard
And things may go wrong
Though you stumble and fall
Don't give up just get up again

You can't complain 
'Bout the heartache and pain
When right there you'll remain
Till you choose to get up

Times may get hard
And Things may go wrong

Just be strong and hold on

Dawn Sears,"Today an old heartache came calling
An old flame I thought died out like some falling star
Instead it's rekindling some memories
That may start an out of control raging fire

That look in your eyes brings back memories
You still have that same smile that once won my heart
The bittersweet feelings still linger
That once fueled our out of control raging fire

An out of control raging fire
Pain has no memory when you burn with desire
The flames grow higher and higher
Till we've reached an out of control raging fire

Inside us the passion is burning
It's too late to stop what we've started tonight
How can we resist this temptation
To restart an out of control raging fire

An out of control raging fire
Pain has no memory when you burn with desire
The flames grow higher and higher
Till we've reached an out of control raging fire
Yes, we've reached an out of control raging fire

Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me

Feel like running and dancing for joy
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy

A committee should be organized to honor me

I feel fizzy and funny and fine

And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,
Life is a loveless tale,
Like a ship without a sail.

Still alone, all at sea,

I’m aglow when you smile at me
Life is simple as A B C
Not a thought in my head
Not a care in the world

Though skies are gray
I’m as gay as a Disney cow
Not a wrinkle upon my brow
Not a cent in the red
Not a care in the world

I view the scene
Like that queen of old Russia
As Kate the Great
Used to state long ago
""Nichevo""

So if I move in a groove
With a giddy trot
I’m a trottin’ because I’ve got
Not a bean in my pot
Not a care in the world

Rent's overdue, my sister has measles
Hole in my shoe, my belt’s drawn tight
My income is nil, my in-laws are weasels
My present is dark, my future’s a fright
But as long as you are there
What in the world do I care?

Though I can’t jive
I revive when I see your face
Not a limp in my merry pace
Not a crimp in my style
Not a care in the world

Though I’m a wreck
I can peck if you take a chance
Not a shine on my blue serge pants
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

Why should I fret
When I bet on a sure thing?
Like Nick the Greek
Used to say every day
""Yip-i-ay""

So if I’m struttin’
With nuttin’ ahead in store
There’s a reason I said before
I’ll repeat it once more

Not a thought in my head
Not a cent in the red
Not a crimp in my style
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Was walking down an alley and caught a 
Bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma
But man nobody cared
The gospel preached in his neighborhood? nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood
You could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to christ from his same hood
Part of church plant
Come on now ain't his name good
This is blessing but I'm stressing that this is not the norm
We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if jesus is calling you that you would be found

Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
He got older and started doing what the hood did
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
But the jammed up so them beat him nice
He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
Praise god he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach christ they 
Make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary
By then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth and used 
A couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects

In luke 4 16 on down to 21 jesus says 
He's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes isaiah
That shows our savior targets oppressed 
Captive blind and the broke I'm saying
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st john 2:6 is way we should go
In dueteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word an
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to god you'd be burdened for beautiful feet
Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)

You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world

Dawson Taylor,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Dawson Taylor,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2005
Dawson Taylor,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2005
Dawuud Allah,"One of my partners once told me that
""The only thing bigger than your will to do something
Is your will not to do something
And even that's the power of your own will

Man, Tahir, love life
Whether good or bad times
I'ma climb?
Make it all better instead of sitting around uptight
Looking down 'cause it ain't right
Whatcha gon do is the question
Mope around fessing
I stuttin nothing 'cause nothing stuttin me
When them chips get low
And I got no dough
Sleeping on the floor
Haters been poor and always will be
'cause I know my self-worth, haters can't kill me
See I realize that
Niggas need to ask themselves how they feel about that
Whether you trying to get paid
Or trying to get off crack
But you can't and you ain't unless you change that

What you think is what you will see
How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy
Make a fist if you feel me
Chill if you can't
Nigga ain't and you will see

(Shaunda Steele-Williams)
Sometimes I sit back and look up to sky 
Asking myself why do I try (will power, will power)
Do we begin to unite

These pessimists
Cowards don't exist
Scared to take a risk
Turn around and be the first to make a diss
Try to keep it crisp and tight and let it rip
If it don't work, at least I tried
Hell I coulda died not satisfied
You said you couldn't but you lied
People don't try 'cause they petrified
Of what though
I ain't even worried about the po-po
And once we ??? them
There ain't a place that can't go
And bump takin things slow
Watching people shit from get-go
In my way-get blowed
In my space-get towed
Use shit as fertilizer
Make yourself grow and get wiser

What you think is what you will see
How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy
Make a fist if you feel me
Chill if you can't
Nigga ain't and you will see

(Shaunda Steele-Williams)
Sometimes I sit back and look up to sky 
Asking myself why do I try (will power, will power)
Do we begin to unite

You better wake up, get up, and big on up
You better wake up and big on up
Say what? Wake up, get up, big on up
Wake up and big on up
You better wake up, get up, and big on up
You better wake up and big on up
Say what? Wake up, get up, big on up
Wake up and big on up

Start it off with a mix of sand 
Add water with the sun and some help from man 
Let the mix just sit 'til you get cement 
Then form a rectangle and you get some bricks 
And when you get bricks 
No need to stall 
Stack bricks real tall 
And you get brick walls 
Get a plan 
Keep it going til you figure things out
Work your plan 
Like you know it til you get a brick house 

Yea gon send this out to all political prisoners
Worldwide, know what I'm sayin
Behind enemy lines and on the streets
It's all the same game
To my nigga Oshawn, stay strong soldier
'cause when you get home, you know we got you dog 
Believe that

(Robert Williams)
True thinking is a deliberative act of the mind
Held fast to its task
Good or bad
The mind will bring into you life what you conceive
Strong will is the master of the body
Directed in the ? in the dictates of desire or reason
Will is itself power to bring forth the motive
On impluse that is strongest
Be it positive or negative
As is the mind, so is the will
Contemplate confidence and belief in your will
So your mind will be clothed 
With the power to have all possessions
Self-possessions, self-restraints, self-direction
And self-complusion to have anything you desire
The law of the will is the law of all rounds
Of symmetric character of self
God gave us a choice to direct thy will
And the power to be or not to be
The choices is ours-Willpower",Willpower,2001
Dax Riders,"Once upon a time science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh
And they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more you can hear the people cry
But there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

How can I explain, things are different today
Darkness all around and nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care

Supernature, better watch out
Look at you now, better watch out
Look at you now, supernature

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now
Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
(Supernature)
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Maybe nature has a plan to control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again many battles he must win
Till he earns his place on earth like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end, now that all depends on you

You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse

And noah's ark might confuse you but

Would I lay to rest alone

Well, it's time to head out; 
Gotta find my place to rest 
Before the sun goes down 
In the darkness of the west. 

If I climb those stairs, 
Will I find my way back to home
If I climb those stairs ,
Would I find my way alone
Alone
Alone

(There must be something more)

Scratching to gain back some control of this twisted dream

And we're all in the know
From one television show
But it stops right there
And take care of yourself
'Cause it's all about ourselves
And it stops right there
I'm lost looking in a sea of faces everywhere
Now where did she go?
I need to find her quickly
To immerse my insecurity
I'm lonely amongst these people
And I need to feel love
And I need to feel part of something
Is that strange?
And why are they reluctant to talk
And why do they look alone when they walk?
I see a face but no names
But despite my confusion
I've come to the conclusion
That people
Need people
It's something I forget
But I've come to accept
That people
Need people
And I'm alright
And I'm ok
I'm surviving well
Without you
And what did you want
And what did you expect
Did you want me to still talk about you?
No, no way
I'm on my own now
And doing fine ( and doing fine )
No, no way
I'm on my own now
And doing fine ( and doing fine )
And anyone can give
Money to a good cause
But it stops right there
And anyone can sign
A petition to change the law
But it stops right there
And we can believe in socialism
Or any theorism
But it stops right there
And take care of yourself
'Cause it's all about yourself
And it stops right there
But I'm not part of this
I'm not seeing what they're seeing
I'm staring at the ceiling to the world
To see what is lying
On the horizon
Maybe I'll see you again someday girl
But despite my raw deal
I still feel
That people
Need people
It's something we forget
But we must accept
That people
Need people
And I'm alright
And I'm ok
I'm surviving well without you
And what did you want
And what did you expect
Did you want me to still talk about you?
No, no way
I'm on my own now
And doing fine
No, no way
I'm on my own now
And doing fine
I'm doing fine",I'm Doing Fine,2000
Day One,"Give me a smile
Things aren't that bad, are they?
It'll take a while
But we can get this right some way

So dry your eyes and
Wipe those tears away
'Cause, baby, you are mine and
That's the way it's gonna stay

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life

You're going up in the world
And, baby, I'm coming down
Looks like we're both out of luck, girl
And we're stuck in this town

We'll call it opportunity
Try and see it as fate
'Cause this is all new to me
So you'll have to pardon my mistakes

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life

Now, I've been chasing that girl
Waiting for her to catch me
And now I got that girl
Right where she wants me

And you can try and get out of here
Until you've forgot
But, baby, I'll still be here
And whether you like it or not

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life",In Your Life,2000
Day One,"He was in section a to g,
She was under h to t.
Their eyes met across the queue,
Look at you.

He asked for her current address,
She blushed and said how her hair was a mess.
He said ""I'd really like,
To go out with you"".
He said ""we'll wait, 'til ??? day,
And that way, the queen can pay.
So I'll pick you up tomorrow"".

She answered wearing slippers,
Said she couldn't find a baby-sitter.
He said ""I'm going nowhere without you.""
So she took her kids to her mom's for the night,
And they went and the birght lights,
In the town, mad them feel, like a million pounds.

They went out for a romantic dinner,
Then went to to see a real blues singer.
She said ""I really like, being with you"".
And when they came to the end of the night,
He asked her hard again in a fortnight.
She said ""I'll see your before, in the line,
When we sign"".

So two weeks later she's looking for him,
But he's not in the queue amongst all the men.
She's looking frantically, but no luck.
She walks up to his friend,
And asks him why he isn't signing ???
He shakes his head, she says ""what's wrong?""
He said ""they took him away, yesterday"".
He said ""you see my darling, they did a search,
Turns out he's ??? in building work.""

He said ""I've seen it before, another broken heart,
From love on the dole, love on the dole,
It's love on the dole, love on the dole,
Love on the dole,
He said ""it's love on the dole"".",Love on the Dole,2000
