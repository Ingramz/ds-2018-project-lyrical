Why don’t you put some base on your tone?
Can’t you see that it is a long leave
Taking care of all day long
You’re making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no that’s not what I mean
I’m so done with pleasing you
I’m so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die
Makes me feel like I’m alive
Boy your words don’t carry weight to hold me down

I’m still so good over you
I’m still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I’m still so good over you

I bet you you think I need you
I'm tellin' you I don't, you lost your mind
I used to be so see through
But now I never let you on my mind
I'm worth a bunch of millions
But you be actin' like your money is mine
I'm on the Eiffel chillin'
I be damned if I let you blow my mind
Baby what you think about life
Without me by your side
I bet you you wanna get it right, but even if you get it right

I’m still so good over you
I’m still so good over you

¿Qué vienes a buscar? (A ti)
Ya es tarde (¿por qué?)
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa

Que no te desean (estás mintiendo, ya lo sé)
Vete, olvida que existo, que me conociste
Y no te sorprendas
Olvida de todo, que tú para eso tienes experiencia

En busca de emociones un día marché
De un mundo de sensaciones que no encontré
Y al descubrir que era todo una gran fantasía, volví
Porque entendí que quería las cosas que viven en ti

Adiós (ayúdame)
No hay nada más que hablar (piensa en mí)

Is growing stronger, maybe it's true

Did you ever have a dream
where you're walking naked down the street
And everyone just stares
Did ya ever feel so deep yet to speak your mind
you put others straight to sleep
you wonder if anybody cares
Sometimes I think I'm the only one whose day turned out
Unlike it had began

And I feel barenaked and I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore 
'cause I'm barenaked and I know
Life's what you make it
Wish I could float away to some other day

Did you ever go downstairs to start your day but your car's not there
Yeah you know the joke's on you
Did ya ever try your luck with a pick-up line
But you just sucked
You tell yourself it wasn't you
And I know it's hard to hold it inside
It's days like these I run and hide

When I feel barenaked and I just can't take it 
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore
'cause I'm barenaked and I know
Life's what you make it 
Wish I could float away to some other day

It's all a state of mind
But I don't mind
Trying to find a way to keep my head above the mess I make
What the world creates
Sometimes it feels so good to let it all fall as we will fall
I may fall we all fall
And then the world comes tumbling down down down down down

I'm barenaked and I just can't take it 
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore
'cause I'm barenaked and I know

You've got your point of view
There's nothing I can I do
Can't change you mind
Can't leave it all behind
Your living in the past
We talk and talk
This goes on for hours
About how my life should be
Why is it over me
Don't want to fight 
Don't want to waste my time
Baby this can't last
I'm moving on- moving on

Said what you wanted to 
What the point in this
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
What's there to discuss
Can I go now(now now now)
Can I go now(now now now)

What the point of trying to reach a compromise
When you're the judging jury
What's the story
I can't make you see that I'm not always wrong
I can't make it right
Its time to move on 
I'm moving on ( yeah yeah yeah)
Chorus
 lets call it day
Ill pack my bags be on my way
Sure don't need to stay
Where I'm not welcome anyway
But now that's alright 
And that's ok

There's nothing left to do
Maybe I not for you 
So why don't you let it go
What the point of all this talk talk talk talk
We could go day and night
It still wouldn't make it right!

Baby I'm amazed
After what we've been through
All that I can say is
There's no perfect plan
And no finish line
We just learn to fall 
And get back up inside

Didn't think we'd make it
So glad we didn't break up 
Now we're good together
And stronger than before

It's not complicated
And I wanna celebrate it
'Cause it feels like the first time
When you walked into the room and
I can't believe we made it
When all around us love was faded
When you look into my eyes
It feels like the First Time again

We stood out on the bridge
And everywhere in between
Pushed it to the edge
You never lost your faith
You proved that we were strong
And I'm glad you did
This is something that 
I can't believe I could have missed

We don't have to try hard
Now that we've come this far
We're good together
And on the other side of this

It's not complicated
And I wanna celebrate it
'Cause it feels like the first time
When you walked into the room and
I can't believe we made it
When all around us love was faded
When you look into my eyes

I'll do it all again
If they would leave me too

No cheese in the purse

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

I've been there, done that, now I ain't lookin' back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go

You moved so gracefully, nothing at all like me.
Give us a smile and wave, you always did know to kill 'em baby
I can't remember ever feeling this way,
A burning feeling rushing all through my veins.

I should be above it I know, but I just can't let it go.
You might have heard it, I said you don't deserve him.
But girl don't take it personally 'cause it's just jealousy

I didn't really mean to cause such an ugly scene.
Showing up at your house,
Half drunk and crazy bitch I called you out,
Or at that party where I made such a mess
And poured my whiskey down the back of your dress.

What got in me is something more than envy.
I should be above it I know, but I just can't let it go.

I won't tell anyone you bought a new pair.

Watching evergreen bend in the snow
Remembering Christmas the way it had been
So many seasons ago

When children would reach for their stockings
And open the presents they found
The lights on the tree would shine bright in their eyes
Reflecting the love all around

But this year there's no one to open the gifts
No reason for trimming the tree
And just as a tear made it's way to the floor
She heard voices outside start to sing

May the joy of the season surround you

Faces of friends in the crowd
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders
Driven away by the sound

Was suddenly filled with a song

Jennifer Nettles,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Jennifer Page,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be

For you, the sun will be shinin',

It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll never be cold

Jennifer Paige,"I see a mystery ship out on the water
I wonder where it's sailing to
Is someone waiting in some other harbor
These fantasies they blow my way
Like sirens to a fool
And in the stillness of my soul
I keep returning to

[Chorus]
Always you
You know I live on the wind where love runs free
I come back to you
Always you
And when I fall to earth you're always there for me
I come back, I come back, I come back to you

Looking at myself 'til the mirror shatters
I hear a madman sing his tune (he says)
It's only love that ever really matters
I wake up in this dream tonight
That's when I see the truth
Of all the faces in my heart
There's only one I choose

[Chorus]

Something in my soul never changes baby
You're the one that's keeping me sane
There is no other that I have ever conceived
Could be my lover and never leave when I run free
Could be my lover, could be my lover",Always You,1998
Jennifer Paige,"They say the road of life
Is paved with good intentions we have
No matter how we try
To keep our promises, sometime we just can't
Little bit of faith can be wondrous
It's the only place we can turn to

Between you and me
There's enough love that I believe
We'll rise above and we'll get through anything
Between you and me

They say that bridges burn
From one soul to another if you don't tend the flame
And I pray somehow we've learned
To build an understanding from the ashes that remain
Not enough faith can be dangerous
It's the only place we can turn to

There are times I don't feel safe
Like we're not on solid ground
But I trust your eyes
When I see you look this way
I know we'll find it, we're gonna find it",Between You and Me,1998

Never shoulda lingered over dessert

Realizes she's on her own again

When it hits me you're not coming back

Driving south on Kings road 
I've got you in my coat here 
Written down 
I find new ways to want you 
But I can't reach you 
So I head downtown 

It's forever later 
You're so far away 
As night becomes day 
I remember the way you held me 
Baby won't you 

Tell me when so I keep believing 
Tell me again I'm on your mind all the time 
Tell me when, don't want to lose this feeling 
Tell me again when you'll be mine 
When you'll be mine 
Tell me when 

Flying standby 
On the redeye when you saw me 
You left and I heard voices in my head 
A happy accident that had to happen 
A car crash in my bed 

It's forever later 
You're so far away 
As night becomes day 
I remember the way you held me

Jennifer Paige,"Some days I couldn't get up
I couldn't get down
Bored of everything
Somehow a little black cloud
Rained over me 
Someone was making me mad
Good turned bad and I lose everything
To get you back
Just to get you back

But
These days the world's alright
The sun shines bright
I'm kicking off the bad dreams
These days I don't think twice
I walk on light
I'm positively somewhere
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on and on and on and on and on

Out of the fire into the swimming pool
Sometimes I drown my tears
Same old fears come back
Someone was making me ill
I bet you're still 
A two, three, four letter word
Guess you heard
Pretty little birds fly home

But
These days the sun kicks in
The good guys win
I'm legal in the back seat
These days I'm safe and sound
Not dragged down
You want to know the reason
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on and on and on and on and on

Brigde:
Thank you for not being here
I feel better when you're not sleeping in my head
Tossing and turning
Messing up the sheets
The love we made was incomplete
Like the shoes on your feet 
The same stuff I've heard it before
That philosophy starting to bore me
Now you won't have to smile and ignore me

These days the karma's right
The sun shines bright
I'm kicking out the bad dreams
These days I don't think twice
I walk on light
I'm positively somewhere
These days go on [and on and on and on and on]

Who I am how we move 
I just sit and watch the frenzy 
I can't catch my breath to stop and see 
Is this what you meant 
Is this happy 
What's going on all around me

It all comes down so abstractly

Could've come clean and let me walk away in style

Funny thing is.....

Like no one ever left you and survived

To find somebody new
And I found strength inside of me I never knew

When your grip keeps slippin' and your clutch is gone
Ooh,ooh, ooh, ooh and you're tired spinning your wheels on
Your brains front lawn

Oh, oh, oh, oh well keep your asphalt under sunny side up
A gas credit card and a giant coffee cup

Jennifer Paige,"Girl meets boy, girl goes crazy
Boy looks away, she gets her heart broken
No words are spoken
Boy comes back and acts
As if everything is cool
Soon she's got him back on a pedestal
She only sees what she wants to see
Love is blind, love is so misleading

(CHORUS)
I see the light, oh what a light
And I am sober
All that you served to me
No longer will I drink it in
I took the time to think it over
I see the you that I never knew
Now it's finally sinking in
I am sober

Girl wakes up and smells the coffee one day
Realizes she's on her own again
All alone again
Boy takes every opportunity
To play on every insecurity
Get her back on track
She's in a daze, back in the fire
But will she cave into her old desires

Tantas noches de ansiedad sin conocerte
Sin poderme enamorar por no tenerte

De repente llegas tu tan suave mente

Te llamaba sin hallar mi gran ausente

Y de un sueño me despierto tan plácidamente

Algún presente que te agrade Señor,

Hoy estoy aquí buscando tu perdón
Como pude perder tu amor
El estar sin ti es un gran error

Desde el día que te fuiste
Mi mundo se paro
Sin ti no, no se quien soy
Porque tu eres mi destino
Uno en un millón
Porque tienes que creerme

Cuando me tocas siento que vivo
Tu me completas con cada beso
Cuando me voy y cuando regreso

Tu me completas con tus palabras
Cuando me dices cuanto me amas
Tu completabas toda mi vida 
Pero tu adiós la dejo vacía

Ya no se vivir con este dolor

Despertándome en mi las ganas de quedarme aquí contigo
Comienzo a rozar tu piel, va a ser uno de esos días 
Luego tu me besas provocando la locura
Me pierdo en tu mirada y en verano sigue hablándonos de

Brisas suaves, nubes blancas 
Cielo azul y olas altas
Mojando nuestros suenos mientras
Llega la tarde y se va la tarde
es tal y como la sonaba
el sol colándose en la almohada
Acariciando nuestras caras
y se ve la tarde

Cuando me seduces tus palabras me cautivan
Me llegas a la cumbre y nuestras alamas se combinan
Comienzas a explorar mi cuerpo desnudando mis sentidos
Me lleno de memorias y tu no te imagines
la fiebre que me da cuando el verano sigue hablándonos de

Brisas suaves, nubes blancas 
Cielo azul y olas altas
Mojando nuestros suenos mientras
Llega la tarde y se va la tarde
es tal y como la sonaba

yo solo quiero disfrutar contigo ese momento
Si alguna vez me encuentro en otro día tan perfecto
Me acordare de ti

Me levanto a las nueve si hay que trabajar
Trato de llegar temprano a la iglesia los domingos
Me visto como siento y casi siempre llevo el pelo suelto

En retratos soy parecida a mi papa

Y aunque a veces no combine lo que hago en la cocina
Trato de mostrar cariño y siempre llevo una sonrisa

Y la música se abraza con la vida

Toda una historia en mi
Cantando mis canciones sobre la arena
Lo hago porque soy así

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Wir sind zur Hälfte das Sprachrohr und zur Hälfte Gehör,

Du hast Schwielen an der Stirn, hast dich stetig nur gewehrt.
Zweifel kräuseln sich um deine Schläfen, grau meliert
Denn der Weg den wir gehen, ist selten asphaltiert.

Was sind das für Hände, die dich am Nacken packen
Was für Füße hacken dir beim Laufen in die Hacken
Du kommst ins Wanken, kommst auf andere Gedanken
Deine Hände, wieder blutig, sind nur Hände, keine Pranken.

Aber du musst dir oft genug die Knie aufgeschlagen haben
Bis du erkennst, dass weiche Knie dich nicht tragen.
Haben wir uns zuviel aufgeladen, mit diesem Stein im Magen?
Und da die wagen Fragen fragen, die wir nicht zu fragen wagen?

Wer hat die Karten so gemischt, so gezinkt,so gesehen
Wer hat die Gruppe hier so gelinkt?

Aber wenn du schreist, schreist du nicht allein!

Hast du den Schuss nicht gehört, das war ein schwacher Start.
Doch Niederlagen, Unbehagen machen Schwache stark.
Nichts macht so hart, wie die Zeit, die man der Rache hat.
Alles im Griff, der rote Faden ist aus Stacheldraht.

Wundbrand und die Wut um dein Spiegelbild,
Ohne Verband wird die Blutung wohl nie gestillt.
Die Hände in den Taschen stehst du faustgeballt,
Für jeden Makel einen Nagel in die Haut gekrallt.

Gehst du aus dir heraus, dann legst du Brotkrumen aus,
So findest du jeden Abend deinen Weg nach Haus.
Doch der Heimweg ist dunkel und mit Schuld behaftet.
Wenn du in dich gehst, dann geh nicht unbewaffnet!

Wer hat die Wahrheit überschminkt, überspielt, überhaupt!
Wer hat dir die Freiheit geraubt?
Die Jahre im Gefängnis, am Ende die Erkenntnis
Egal wie laut du schreist, die Wände bleiben taub!

Wie ein viel zu enges Kleid
Nichts als Eitelkeit
Wer kennt schon seine Nachbarn
Wer hat schon die Zeit
Nichts als Eitelkeit

Wir spielen Stadt Land über Fluss
Und wir suchen bis zum Schluss
Doch der Durst wird nie gestillt
Und zur Planung meiner Fahndung
Dient zuletzt nur eine Ahnung
Nur ein fast verblasstes Bild

Der letzte Stern fällt heute Nacht
Wir sind schon viel zu lange wach
Und keiner weiß was ansteht
Die müden Motten fall'n ins Licht
Ich war zu schnell und glaub' es nicht
Und niemand sagt wo's langgeht
Ich weiß nur vage was ich will
Und ich hab' nur ein Phantombild
Ohne Weg und Weiser ohne Schild
Denn ich hab' nur ein Phantombild
Von dir

Wirf deine Werte über'n Bordstein
Doch wie ehrlich kann ein Wort sein
Das man unter Schmerzen gibt
Wo's juckt darf man nicht kratzen
Ich hab' auf etlichen Matratzen
Nach dir gesucht, umsonst geliebt

Stadt, Land über Fluss
Wir nehm'n den letzten Bus
Und die Übelkeit in Kauf

Ich fress' Papier und kotz' Konfetti
Sag mir wann hört das auf?
Wann hört das auf?

Der letzte Stern fällt heute Nacht
Wir sind schon viel zu lange wach
Und keiner weiß was ansteht
Die müden Motten fall'n ins Licht

Und niemand sagt wo's langgeht

Keine Karte gibt Antwort

Dort wo meine ins Leere greift",Phantombild,2014

In meiner Hand ein Licht, dass mit der Zeit verblassen wird,

Die Tapete in den Zimmern hört nicht auf sich zu erinnern,
Deine Schatten sind noch immer hier und flimmern
wie durch unsichtbare Blender an den Wänden projiziert.

Der Filmstreifen hängt in immergleichen Schleifen fest,
Die BIlder springen wie ein Insekt, dass sich nicht greifen lässt,
Das Geschwirre macht mich irre und es hält mich wach.

Wie unter Fieber werden Glieder heiß, Atem kalt,
Was sich mit Wiederhaken dann in meine Laken krallt,
Ist die Angst vor der Nacht und was sie mit mir macht.

vergänglich wie die Blume die verwelkt wenn man sie pflückt
Nein du bist nicht der Pfau du bist die Feder die ihn schmückt.
Und wenn der Apfel mit gefällt, zerfällt um sein Idyll, 
wenn ein Wahl vermeint der mich vom weg abbringen will in mein Blickfeld fällt,

Wieviel darf ich zeigen und wofür soll ich mich schämen?
Und wer bist eigentlich du, verdammt, und was ist dein Problem?

Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

So if there's anything I've learned from this journey I am on
Simple truths will keep you going, simple love will keep you strong

I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little

The clock is ticking away in vain
Time itself has chased us down
But we've tricked it at it's own game
Nothing to keep me from you

I don't have to see you everyday
Only fools put chains on love
And if I had to live life through 
Alone and without you
It wouldn't change a thing

Timeless love, ageless us
There's no end, always was
A timeless love, heaven born
Ancient vows, never to be torn

There is no tomorrow in my heart
Only dreamers believe in time
So let's leave no regrets behind
I'll give it all when I'm with you

There's no sadness when you see my eyes
There's no distance when I let you go
Cause I know a timeless love, on this rock take me now
And make a lovebird of the coo-coo in the clock

With a flick of the wrist in just a flash

A high priced dress made by mice no less
Some crystal glass pumps and no more stress
Worries will vanish your soul will cleanse
Confide in your very own furniture friends
We'll help you set a new fashion trend

I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
The kind of gal a prince would date
They'll write your name on the bathroom wall
For happy ever after- give Fiona a call

A sporty carriage to ride in style. A sexy man-boy chauffer Kyle
Vanish your blemishes, tooth decay cellulite thighs will fade away
A hool and a hey, have a Bichon Frise

Nip and tuck here and there, to land that prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick liners, shadow blush to get that prince with a sexy tush
Lucky day, hunk buffet
For the lipstick a roll in the hay
You can swoon on the moon with the prince to this tune

And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

Jennifer Thayer,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Jennifer Trainor,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1999

I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart

And other arms may hold a thrill

Can't stand away a day, a week, a month of my whole life
And then it hit me like a ten pound catfish upside my head
Nothing's worth doing if I'm doing it all by myself

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track
This hanging solo is getting so old to me
Gonna find me a baby and make a couple babies and sing in harmony

We'll sing na na na, na na na

She was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire
We hit it off and we talked forever and I bought that girl a ring
Then quicker than a Richard Petty pit stop, I got down on one knee and said

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track
This hanging solo is getting so old to me
Yeah I found you baby, let's make a few babies and sing in harmony, yeah

While we all sup sorrow with the poor;
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears;
Oh Hard times come again no more.

Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Hard Times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
Oh hard times come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
There are frail forms fainting at the door;
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh hard times come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away,
With a worn heart whose better days are o'er:
Though her voice would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,

Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave

The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

I have looked for love before
I was looking all around you
I'm not looking anymore
Now that I've found you, I've found you
When there's something deep inside
That tells me this is real
We're not just going through the motions this time
I know it's love we feel

Just like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
Like the rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around

When the feeling comes around

La la la da la la la
La la la da la

Like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around

Jennifer Warnes,"They say no one should call on you
Unless She's your permission to
But me, I just came anyway
I couldn't care less what you say
'Cause I know you from long before
You hid behind a stained glass door
And walked around
And looked your old friends up and down

But anyway, I thought I'd come give you a look
At where you're from and let you know
I still recall what a child you are underneath it all

[Chorus]
You remember me the funny way I cry
The funny way I sit there when someone says goodbye
The funny way I wind up lost when someone sets me free
Why sure, you remember me

Well, I won't take up your whole day
I've said about all I have to say
I guess I'll be moving on
I know you'll be glad to see me gone
Tonight is our last night in town
So don't worry 'bout me hanging around
Tomorrow night it's Calgary
And you'll be good and rid of me

[Chorus: x2]",You Remember Me,1979
Jennifer Warnes,"Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our lives, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong",Up Where We Belong,1982
Jennifer Warnes,"If you've found another guy
Who satisfies you more than I do
Run to him, I'll step aside

If you think his lips can kiss you
Better than my lips can kiss you
Run to him, forget my pride

If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him and show to him all your emotion

If someone else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him, my tears will dry

If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him and show to him all your emotion

If someone else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him, my tears will dry

If it's me you want to love you
I'll be more than glad to love you
Hold you till your life is done
But, darling, if I'm not the one
Then run to him",Run to Her,1982
Jennifer Warnes,"I've loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
I don't believe that time can heal this wound I'm speaking of
Ah, there ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love.

I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I love to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
Oh I'll never get enough
Ah, there ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love

There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
No cure no drug, it's all been
I can't get nothing done, and be with anyone
I want your brother love, I want that other love
And no cure for love

I don't expect the melody
Just because the things are rough
And I seem became so careful
To forget how good it were
I've never given in
Oh, I've never given up baby
Ah, there ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
No cure no drug, no no
I can't get nothing done, I can't be with anyone
There ain't no cure for love",Ain't No Cure for Love,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a fish on a hook,
Like a knight from an old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I have been unkind,
I hope that you could just let it go by.
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you. no, no

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.

But I swear by this song
By all I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to you. yes I will
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
H called out to me, ""don't ask for so much.""
And a young man leaning on his darkened door,
He cried out to me, ""hey, why not ask for more?""

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned
I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And maybe he would answer
To such a hopeless voice
I practiced all my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumors of my virtue
They moved him not at all
I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothes to black
And where I would surrender
Now I would attack
I stormed the old casino
For the money and for the flesh
And I myself decided
What was rotten, what was fresh
And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach
But no, I could not touch him
With such a heavy hand
His star beyond my order
His nakedness unmanned
I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned",Came So Far for Beauty,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you
Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you

And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you

There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you

Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you",Coming Back to You,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"It's four in the morning, the end of December
 I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
 New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
 There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.

 I hear that you're building your house deep in the desert
 Are you living for nothing now, hope you're keeping some kind of record.

 Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
 She said that you gave it to her
 That night when you planned to go clear
 Did you ever go clear?

 Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
 Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
 You'd been to the station to meet every train
 But she never turned up I'm Lili Marlene

 And you treated some woman to a flake of your life
 And when she got home she was nobody's wife.
 Well I see you there with a rose in your teeth
 One more thin gypsy thief
 Well I see Jane's awake
 She sends her regards.

 And what can I tell you oh what can I tell you
 What can I possibly say?
 I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
 I'm glad that you stood in my way.

 And if you ever come by here, be it for Jane or for me
 I want you to know your enemy's sleeping, I want you to know your woman is free.

 Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
 I thought it was there for good so I never really tried.

 And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
 She said that you gave it to her
 That night when you planned to go clear

Jennifer Warnes,"They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
I'm guided by the birthmark on my skin
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line that's moving through the station? 
I told you, I told you, I told you, I was one of those

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I don't like your fashion business mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
Then we take Berlin, then we take Berlin",First We Take Manhattan,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc
 as she came riding through the dark;
 no moon to keep her armour bright,
 no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.
 She said, ""I'm tired of the war,
 I want the kind of work I had before,
 a wedding dress or something white
 to wear upon my swollen appetite.""

 Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
 you know I've watched you riding every day
 and something in me yearns to win
 such a cold and lonesome heroine.
 ""And who are you?"" she sternly spoke
 to the one beneath the smoke.
 ""Why, I'm fire,"" he replied,
 ""And I love your solitude, I love your pride.""

 ""Well then fire, make your body cold,
 I'm gonna give you mine to hold,""
 saying this she climbed inside
 to be his one, to be his only bride.
 And deep into his fiery heart
 he took the dust of Joan of Arc,
 and high above all these wedding guests
 he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.
 La...

 It was deep into his fiery heart
 he took the dust of Joan of Arc,
 and then she clearly understood
 if he was fire, oh she must be wood.
 I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
 I saw the glory in her eye.
 Myself I long for love and light,
 but must it come so cruel, must it be so brave?
 La...",Joan of Arc,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess.
Is it true you betrayed us? The answer is Yes.
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine,
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline.
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice,
A singer must die for the lie in his voice.

And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty,
You keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty.
Your vision was right, my vision was wrong,
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song.
Oh la...

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid
In the clothes of a man I would like to forgive
In the furs of his leather, the shade of his eyes
Where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise.
Oh good night, good night, my night after night,
My night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night.
Do do do ...

So save me a place in the ten-dollar grave
With those who took money for the pleasure we gave
With those always ready, with those who are dressed
So you could lay down with your head on their breast yes
And the ladies gone moist, and the judge has no choice,
A singer must die for the lie in his voice.
Oh la la la...",A Singer Must Die,1987
Jennifer Warnes,"There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story long ago
She saw the Queen of Heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
But there were sorrows to be here
And mercy, mercy in this world

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do
 
 We've been around, we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every now and then we try
To mend the damage that we've done
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest
I've got this joy inside my breast
To think that I did not forget that child
That song of Bernadette

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, won't let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do",Song of Bernadette,1987

Bring your favorite weapon
Show me how you make your mark
From the whistle in the wind
Through the center of the heart

the moon is full, the night is clear
Hunting season is drawing near
Show me how you claim your ground
Pull the arrow back, take one down

(*)
Maybe tonight
Maybe you'll show
What you feel behind your bow
And maybe I'll go hunting too
Down in the valley with you

I wonder where you hide your heart
I wait for signals in the dark
My aim is pretty good
I'm as quiet as a deer in the wood

(*)

close your eyes, count to ten
You never know you never know
You never know when you never know

so bring this famous trick you do
Bring your arrow, bring your gun
And bring the ache that burns right through
Gonna find out who is the hunted one

Jennifer Warnes,"Saw your face in a dream again
And there's no word for what I was feeling
So deep and wide
I can't hide it any longer
Who let this phantom in
Who will tame this nameless feeling
I'd like to hide
But I can no longer

you're the ghost who keeps on calling
I bar the door, you breeze right through
All my old fences are falling
I don't know what's true
But I'm glad to see you

and to feel you near again
So strong, so warm and tormenting
Ain't nothin' died baby
It just grows stronger

you're the ghost who keeps on calling
I bar the door, you breeze right through
All my old fences are falling
*as I reach for you
*what do I hold on to

No, I won't hide no longer



",I Can't Hide,1992
Jennifer Warnes,"Today I am your chariot horse
Tomorrow I'm your albatross
Suspended by the finest thread
No one could ever see
And when there's breathing in your ear
You put your faith in all you hear
But just how deep those feelings go
I have no way to know
I'll never know

And if I was blind
Would you still be my eyes
Or hide everything you see
Pretending to care about me
When all the time
You're just wishing I'd fade away
You just can't bring yourself to

Say out loud the reasons why
You won't admit you realize
The promise you've been living by
Is just an empty shell
You'll come to bear it like a cross
And then start to tear it like frayed gauze
Though I'm ashamed to be afraid
I just can't help myself
Can't help myself

And if I was blind
Would you still be my eyes
Or hide everything you see

You're just wishing I'd fade away

Jennifer Warnes,"It's Saturday evening, the breeze is so cool
I feel a shiver inside of my dress
There is so many things
They don't teach you in school
Some lessions are tougher than all of the rest

a big moon shines over the edge of the sea
On the prettiest night if there ever was one
But there ain't no moonlight inside of me
Now that you are so thoroughly gone

(*)
If I could only hear your true emotion
If I could feel your joy like I used to do
One little sign, I'd swim an ocean
If I could just find you

remember the river, so wild and free
That sprung from your fingers so easily
Filling the hollow that swallows the rain
And carrying you home to the ocean again

now there ain't nothin', it's dry as a bone
Everyone knows you ain't comin' home
It's more than your brothers
And sisters can bear
Do you hear us all crying and sighing
And calling and calling

(*)

too many nights walking the floor in sadness
Someone lied about a happy ending
Too many dreams all broken now
God has spoken
And we still need you

(*)

if I could only hear your true emotion
If I could feel your joy like I used to do
Whole lotta love here and deep devotion
If I could only find ...

if I could only hear your true emotion
One little sign, I'd swim an ocean
If I could just find ...

if I could only hear your true emotion
If I could feel your joy like I used to
I got love here, and deep devotion

Way down, way way down 
Way way down deep 
You've got me way down, way way down, 
Way way down deep 
You're got me way down, way down deep 
I wander with you in my sleep 
I'm way down, way way down,

Was like my soul could taste you

Jennifer Warnes,"I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
You saw the plan

I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there in the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels

To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truth
You cut through lies

I saw the rain dirty valley
You saw ""Brigadoon""
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed and I tried
You just knew
I sighed

But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

The torch in your pocket 
And the wind on your heels
You climbed on a ladder
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Popcorn and cannonballs
All the season's fears
Trumpets, towers, and tenaments
Wide oceans full of tears

Flags, rags, ferryboats
Senators and scars
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

You climbed on a ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail

Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon",The Whole of the Moon,1992

Playing with lightning

A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

My silence is my self defense

For every time I've held a rose
It seems only felt the thorn
And so it goes and it goes
And so will you soon, I suppose
But my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake

An apron and a spatula
With yesterday's deliveries
And tickets for bachelors
She's a moving violation
From her conk down to her shoes
But she's just an invitation to the blues

But you feel like cagney
And she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single
She's a loner, likes to mingle
Got to be patience, try to pick up a clue
She says how you gonna like'em
Medium or scrambled?
Any way is the only way
Be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase
And a ticket getting out here
It's tired bus station
And an old pair of shoes
Ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her
Get another cup of java
And it's just the way she pours it for you
Joking with the customers
Oh mercy, Mr. Percy!
There ain't nothing back in jersey 
But a broken down jalopy
Of a man I left behind
And a dream that I was chasing
A battle with booze
An open invitation to the blues

Ah, but she's had a sugar daddy
And a candy apple caddy
A bank account and everything
Accustomed to the finer things
He left her for a socialite
He didn't love her except at night
And then he's drunk
And never even told her that he cared
So she took the registration
Car keys and her shoes
Left with an invitation to the blues

Now there's continental trailways leaving
Local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat
I'm sticking round here for a while
Get a room at squire

Sitting by my window
Watching the rain fall to the ground

Counting every drop
About to blow my top

I can hardly catch my breath

And that love was just a memory
But a nightingale
Followed me back home
Where my love was
Waiting there for me

I have lost my faith as lovers often do
When the storm clouds gather overhead
But a nightingale sang a note so true
That I knew I'd lost my fear instead

And to think that I said
Love was for fools
And that time would never heal
These old wounds
But the nightingale saved a prayer for me

In the twilight, he played a faithful true
I have heard the lark over the vale
And I've heard the lonesome whippoorwill
But the sweetest song is the nightingale's
And I know I'll never get my fill

The moon breaking through the tress
And in the stillness of the evening
I heard a rustling in the leaves
And I saw a panther in the yard
Moving slow across the ledge
With silver eyes and a cool regard
And hunger with a cutting edge

Open the door, let it in
This mystery you found
It's all yours now
Come lay the panther down

So I called the eagle and the raven said
My prayer to the sky with the moon as my witness
I looked the panther in the eye and beheld
His violent beauty
That cut so deep and hard
Through my civilized indifference
And reckless disregard

So I open the door and let it in
This mystery I found is all mine now
Time to lay the panther down",The Panther,2001
Jennifer Warnes,"Living now, here but for fortune
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Arise sweet destiny, time runs short
All of your patience has heard their retort
Hear us now, for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Can you hear the words being whispered
All along the American stream
Tyrants freed, the just are imprisoned
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Ah but perhaps too much
Is being asked of too few
You and your children with nothing to do
Hear us now, for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream



",Patriot's Dream,2001
Jennifer Warnes,"The moment we said good bye
Silence tore across the sky
The riverbed by wide and dry
As far as I could see
And someone said
My ghost was found
Laying her burden down
Taking the long way around
Underneath the moonâ?¦

Somewhere on the prairie,
A little cross in mine
A simple wooden marker
With a plastic rose is entwined
And in the stillness of the twilight
As the tumbleweeds wind
I am crawling like a scorpion
Across the melancholy time

so shred the poems
Let the wild birds chase them in the breeze
Let them make their nests
From words like â??pleaseâ??
Put those dreams to rest
Throw them at the moon
Blow the confetti across
The golden west

I was the fragrance in the wild flower
Opening for only you
In the delicate hour
Before the cold shot through
Ten thousand years from now
You'll put your hand in mine
Remembering a fragrance
Full of melancholy time

You see those ravens breaking the prairie sky?
We used to go where ravens fly
Our giddy laughter made the angels cry
To fly as free as you and I

somewhere on the prairie
A cross, a rose, a shrine
Standing for true love
Gone before its time
There goes your shadow down the highway
Out that road I could't fine
While I crawl like a scorpion
Slowly to the new word
Across these miles of prairie
Full of melancholy time




",Prairie Melancholy,2001
Jennifer Warnes,"My home has been a warrior field
Where now and then I've seen
A rainbow rising over the graves
Down in the gentle green
And as I waltzed across the mine
Time sped to breathlessly
As I fought for love
And I sang for love
Too late, love comes to me

I saw you coming over the hill
So strong, so brave, so true
I fell down to my knees and cried
The way I used to do
It came at such surprise to me
I thought those tears had passed
Is it god who laughs this heart awake?
Too late, love comes at last

O lovers how they come and go
Like waves upon the shore
Brave hearts can drown in the briny deep
And still cry out for more
My treasure's in the water now
My pearls are lost at sea
And my heart must bend like a rainbow
Too late, you've come to me






",Too Late Love Comes,2001
Jennifer Warnes,"We can make it, I know we can

Let's go the well
You hear that low humming underground
Hear the skylark in the dell
The wild world is speaking
Let's go to the well

Sometimes my heart feels like a dandelion
Seeds scattered in a careless wind
And nothing to show for my life and time but 
Innocent wonder in the face of thunder
Feeling like something is about begin

Let's build a bonfire
For the stories we tell
Of wild years, the wasted tears
Ant he silent way they fell
See the curls of smoke rising up 
To the big old sky as the moonlight falls 
Down over those distant hiss 
I don't want to be anywhere else anymore
Let's go to the well 

You better believe my faith in you
It is wide and steady as a Texas moon
And when this stuff starts rolling through
Its as all innocent wonder in the face of thunder

Only time will tell

Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light

Jennifer Weatherly,"Arms, strong as timbers
Folding around her like velvet
That's the fine art, of holding a woman
Eyes, that never leave hers
Fingertips that whisper

Without words, you tell her, that you need her
When you part, you always leave a fire burning

Blood spills out, always pumping in time,
Voices cry harmoniously,
The haunted sound of melancholy,

Then fast and furious,a glimmer of wisdom,
An epiphany,a lyrical mystery,
But like all things,the end comes too soon,
And all that's left behind is a vague memory,

Floating unconscious,a melody that glides,
A beat to the soul,hidden in our minds,
Never quit escaping,confined by reason,
Inspiration slides in this Mirage of rythm.",Mirage,2001

Jennings & Keller,"I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

Jenny and Johnny,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

I'm young, I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess,
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.",Love Hurts,

You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

Lying to convince 'em

The hurt is nearly gone

It's time to carry on

The scars won't last forever
The truth will take their place
Angry words will be forgotten
Contempt will fade away

The promise of tomorrow
It will always remain

I heard that he walked, he walked the earth.
God goes where he wants.
And who knows where he is not.
Not in me.

It's the way mothers greet their sons

And God gives and then he takes.
From me.

If I spend all my money I've got no money left
If I place all my chips on only one bet

And it's a surefire bet I'm gonna die
So I'm taking up praying on Sunday nights
And it's not that I believe in your all might
But I might as well
As insurance or bail
'cause institution's like a big bright lie
And it blinds you into fear and consuming and fight
And you've been in the desert underneath the charging sky
It's just you and god
But what if god's not there?
But his name is on your dollar bill
Which just became cab fare
For the evangelist, the communist, the lefts and the rights
And the hypocrites and the jesuits and the blacks and the whites
In the belly of the beast
In the atlanta streets
Or up in laurel canyon
The middle east
Still they're dying on the dark continent
It's been happening long enough to mention it
Have I mentioned my parents are getting back together again
It's been twenty-five years
Of spreading infection
Somehow we're not affected
So my mom, she brushes her hair
And my dad starts growing bob dylan's beard
And I share with my friends a couple of beers

In the belly of the beast

Jenny Lewis,"I was of poor folk
But my mother had a rabbit fur coat
And a girl of less character pushed her down the la river
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'
She put a knife to her throat
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'
When my ma refused, the girl kicked dirt on her blouse
'stay away from my mansion house'

my mother really suffered for that
Spent her life in a gold plated body cast
Now, you ask, did she get that girl back?
She payed a visit to that mansion house
She knew the girl was not there
But her father was in cufflinks with slicked-back black hair
He invited her in, they never sang a note
But she took off that rabbit fur coat

and who do you think came home?
Miss so and so
She took one look at my mama and what did she say?
'why are you stealing from my mansion house?'
'I'm in love with mr so and so
He invited me in, I'm a girl no more'
Then she dragged my ma out by her throat
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'

let's move ahead twenty years, shall we?
She was waitressing on welfare, we were living in the valley
A lady says to my ma 'you treat your girl as your spouse
You can live in a mansion house'
And so we did, and I became a hundred-thousand-dollar kid
When I was old enough to realize, wiped the dust from my mother's eyes
It's all this for that rabbit fur coat

but I'm not bitter about it
I've packed up my things and let them have at it
And the fortune faded, as fortunes often do
And so did that mansion house
Where my ma is now, I don't know
She was living in her car, I was living on the road
And I hear she's putting stuff up her nose
And still wearing that rabbit fur coat

but mostly I'm a hypocrite
I sing songs about the defecit
But when I sell out and leave omaha
What will I get?
A mansion house and a rabbit fur coat

Jenny Lewis,"What are you changing?
Who do you think you're changing?
You can't change things
We're all stuck in our ways
It's like trying to clean the ocean
What do you think, you can drain it?
Well, it was poison and dry
Long before you came

But you can wake up younger under the knife
You can wake up sounder if you get analyzed
And I'd better wake up
There but for the grace of God go I

It's hard to believe your prophets
When they're asking you to change things
With their suspect lives, we look the other way
Are you really that pure, sir?
Thought I saw you in Vegas
It was not pretty, but she was (not your wife)

But she will wake up wealthy
And you will wake up forty-five
And she will wake up with baby
There but for the grace of God go I

What am I fighting for?
The cops are at my front door
I can't escape that way
The windows are in flames
And what's that on your ankle?
You say they're not coming for you
But house arrest is really just the same (just the same)

Like when you wake up behind the bar
Trying to remember where you are
Having crushed all the pretty things
There but for the grace of God go I

But I still believe
And I will rise up with fists
And I will take what's mine
There but for the grace of God go I

And the till isn't at all

Shooting out your windows I bet

Know that it's hunting season
It's a joke that you'll never get
Cause wooden ducks they do not bleed

The only goose that you'll bite
Is the goose egg you call your wife
When the bars announce it's closing time
And my heart it is still beating
But it's fight or flight

Is not necessarily
The entrance into paradise
Into paradise

Have money

Cause every dollar you invent
You're even more hellbent
On risking life and limb for another toast
When we were falling into puddles
I knew you had it in for me
Scraped my face on the ground
Till blood was down me
From my nose to the hem of my jeans
And my heart it is still bleeding

Could be the entrance into paradise

When I stopped and looked back
As my mind departed
I've been losing sleep
And I cannot sit still
I'm not the same woman

I threw my clothes away in the trash
I stood barefoot on the blazing concrete,
I was waiting for the gut of the thunder
I don't wanna bore you with how I feel,
But when the walls came down,
The shit got real
I never thought I would ever be here,

As if there was no there
I messed around with something I always hated
I took a blanket into the bath
Opened my eyes and hallucinated,
I took a nap and woke up in the grass

Everybody has it
There's a little bit of sand left in the hourglass

Down in the valley I got hypnotized
It left a mark that hasn't faded

Got a chancy girl haircut
And a plane ticket to Paris
I stayed there with Pansy,

Lost his lover to a sickness,
I slept beside him in his bed

She was smoking on a gypsy
She had a ring in her nose and her eyes
Were changing like moonstones
She said, open up late bloomer,
It will make you smile
I can see that fire burning,
In you little child.

Nancy came from Boston,
She got in trouble very often
'Cause her parents had forgotten her,
She would skate over the pond
She was searching for the writer
Of a song that made her shiver
She listened over and over
On a Walkman cassette
She said, come with me late bloomer,
For a little while,
I wanna see that fire burning,

How could I resist her,
I had longed for a big sister
And I wanted to kiss her,
But I hadn't done that
We found the writer,
He was just some kid from Boston
I was jealous as I watched him talking to her
But man he's not astonish,
Didn't look like no Adonis
But as Nancy had promised,
He was heavy as led
And he said, come with us late bloomer,
For a little while,
We wanna feel that fire burning,
In you little child

Give me my candor,
But I just had to have her
And at the time I didn't mind sharing with him
He rode in silence,
All the way back to the seventh
And I promised I'd write her but I never did
And she said, au revoir, late bloomer,
For a little while,
You gotta keep the fire burning,
In you little child",Late Bloomer,2014
Jenny Lewis,"When I met you, you were just a boy
And you were tongue-tied and wearing corduroy
When you kissed me, I was so annoyed
'Cause I was already gone

Call up your girlfriends, let's go out tonight
We're gonna drink ourselves some burgundy wine
Talk all about how we've saved the date
I can't believe I'm getting married in May

I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you until all the Polaroids fade

We were kids then, in the Daisy Age
And we wore peace signs as the riots blazed
When we candy-flipped, we'd stay out too late
'Cause we were already gone

Call up your girlfriends, let's go out tonight
I want to reminisce and get a little high
Talk all about how we've saved the date
I can't believe I'm getting married in May

I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you until all our hair turns gray

Now we are living in Ladonia Estates
And we eat out every night and drink every day
But there are some things money cannot say
Like the feeling of hell in a hallway

I could love you forever
I could love you forever

I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever",Love U Forever,2014
Jenny Lewis,"When the twin towers fell and it all went to hell,
I knew you'd believe in me soon
It's what tore us apart, you perfect the art
Of making it all about you
But I can read your fortune,
Just lay out your palm
Whatever you're avoiding will greet at the dawn

Because it's a new you every day
Putting on a different face
And the farther that you run from me
How will you overcome it?
It's a new you every day

And you struggle with sobriety,
Dreams of known variety,
Listening to kill 'em all
Tend for high society, social anxiety
We missed you at the head bang's ball

But I can read your fortune,
Just lay out your palm
Whatever you're avoiding,
They will all sing along

Because it's a new you every day
Putting on a different face
And the farther that you run from me
How will you overcome it?
It's a new you every day!

Where you come from,
Gets the best of you!

Because it's a new you every day
And when I loved you, I used to say
The farther that we run from it
How will we overcome it?
It's a new you every day",The New You,2014
Jenny Lewis,"I used to think you could save me,
I've been wandering lately
Heard she's having your baby,
And everything's so amazing
It goes on and on and on and on,
It goes on and on and on and on

But she's not me, she's easy

All those times we were making love,
I never thought we'd be breaking up
Bet you tell her I'm crazy
It goes on and on and on and on,
It goes on and on and on and on

But she's not me, she's easy

Remember the night I destroyed it all
When I told you I cheated,
And you punched through the drywall
I took you for granted
When you were all that I needed!

Dreams really do come through
I feel it everywhere,
Even in my red hair
And if don't wreck it,
Then I won't wreck it either,
When I'm out on the road
If for just one second,
You'd ask me to forget all about
Slippery slopes, whiskey and clothes

I see it happening,
I'll get the golden ring
I want eternity,
For her and you and me
And if you don't expect it,
I won't expect it either,
When we take off our clothes
If for just one second,
She hugs you to forget all about
Slippery slopes, mushrooms and coke

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa

Is anyone listening?
There's joy that freedom brings
And I'll be in liberty
If she eats after me

'Cause if you don't express it,
You will express it later
With who God only knows

It helps us to remember
That we like each other the most

There's a black cat by your side
And I'm afraid you chose the red door,
With the triple 6 neon sign
And what those witchdoctors do to you
I wouldn't want it for myself
After all that you've been through
Haven't you learned anything?

You can't outrun 'em, you can't outrun 'em
You can't outrun 'em,
They want your head, you can't outrun 'em

I guess two souls will meet again,
When the universe thinks they should.
Even if their own bloodlines,
Don't run as deep as they could
And will your mama pull you through?
I wouldn't wish it on my enemy
Now that I am living proof,
That history repeats

You can't outrun 'em, you can't outrun 'em
You can't outrun 'em,
They want you dead
You can't outrun 'em, you can't outrun 'em

You better talk quickly, 'cause my sister's at the door
'Cause I want to know everything,
Who I am and what it's for
What the Lord has planned for you,
I guess that it was meant
Wanted to get to know you,
Before you were dead!

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

I'd make amends for the other night 
If you'd be here with me holding me tight. 
Is this the chance when we fly away? 
Cause I need to know if I'm coming back, 
I push and pull just to get what I want. 
In the end I should know that you bring it all to me.

Reach out, you can go overboard if you want to.
In and out, don't lose control, don't lose control. 
Just don't take it back.

And I get so close, but I runaway, I runaway. 
Things I fear the most, keep me here to stay, but anyway

Can we try for right now, free of doubt. 
If you give the chance I could try and figure out. 
I'm kind of scared because I don't know how. 
But I'm watching the close calls and catching my breath now. 
There could be time when I'd fly away. 
But you need to know that I'm coming back. 
Don't want to push and pull anymore, 
Just to get what I want, when you bring it all to me.

You said you always wanted someone to tell you it's OK. 
Well, I guess it's my chance to tell everyone everything.

The faintest love glides six above cement and rust and bones.
And I'll gather my eggshells softly I guess till I have enough to fill up the nest you're on.
I'll draw up the blue prints but I'll never use them.

Like a fire is a womb,

Does anybody want it?
Does anybody want me?

I've been mapping it out
I don't know what's wrong with me
But I wish that it was something else
I've been mapping it out
Maybe you should find a girl who cares about herself

There's solace at the bottom of a bottle
Ba da da da da da
There's solace at the bottom of a bottle
Ba da da da da da

Everywhere I look I see your face
No button I can push, delete, erase
Got nothing straight but for the emptiness
No one left for me to miss

I've been mapping it out
I don't know what's wrong with me
But I wish that it was something else
I've been mapping it out
Maybe you should find a girl who cares about herself

There's solace at the bottom of a bottle
Ba da da da da da
There's solace at the bottom of a bottle
Ba da da da da da

Down here we've got so much time to forget

I wonder if this is how I pay for the things I've broken carelessly
Nobody wants to step on it
I guess I just keep drinking

There's solace at the bottom of a bottle
Ba da da da da da
There's solace at the bottom of a bottle

Make it a fast cut
Don't wanna feel the ache
Don't wanna keep the rush

Can go, don't bother with the table
We can do it on the floor
God knows I am sure

Make it a clean break
Make it a fast cut
Don't wanna feel the ache
Don't wanna keep the rush

Don't need for anesthetic, oh
And no more laughing gas
Just sterilize the scalpel
And let's get this over with
We got muscle to transect

If I come to, I still feel you
Creeping in my skin
It's back, I lie under the knife
And start over again
Cannot buy no vitamins

The pieces don't fit, how I guess
Worn so thin and caving in
Frozen between a no and yes

I'm sliding from sometime
Ripping in two
The memory planted
I'm just what grew

You come to find me, a mess at your door
Arms under elbows as I hit the floor
I mean to tell you just what I've done
How could you choose me when I've just begun?
Don't know what I'll be when morning comes

Every night the sheets pulled tight
I'm sinking before I begin
Silent as the light goes black
And digging to see what beats within

Cause your friends are messed up anyway
And when they come around, 
Somehow they feel up and you feel down.

When we were kids, we hated things our parents did
We listened low to Casey Kasem's radio show
That's when friends were nice, 
To think of them just makes you feel nice

And October leaves cover everything.

And shut out what they say; 
They're too dumb to mean it anyway

Backyard summer pools and Christmases were beautiful
And the sentiment of coloured mirrored ornaments
And the open drapes 
Look out on frozen farmhouse landscapes

Jens Johansson,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovey people

We danced around with Borealice
We're space truckin' round the the stars
Come on let's go Space Truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on let's go Space Truckin'

The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing

They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealice
They're Space Truckin' everyday

Suddenly I realized what locks are for
No trusting them anymore, lights are out

Empty the stare, innocent and unaware, dragged out from my home ,my lair.
Earmarked me, hurt me, burned me.

You can not see the eyes, they grow behind
you
It's my song they now sing to you
You stand no chance

They'll kill for me, steal back my freedom, set me free
It's my minions versus thee
Fiery the vengeance, hate will drain me

All I want is to be untamed and free, howl and dream

The dream is alive, with the moon on the hills every night
Run around and see another side of the dream
Freedom has a meaning for me, you can't tame me

You will remember the day you crossed my path
Leave me without a guard and you feel my wrath
What you have done to me has made me bitter and cruel
I'll see that all the hate you spread returns to you, you, to you

Emma kisses his mouth and says
""Over my dead body""

But, oh, pumpkin pie
I'm gonna love you 'til I die
It's just scary sometimes
But 'til death and beyond
Baby, you're the one I want

The tram screeches like a dying cat
Flying out of Slottsskogen
Casper takes out a Sharpie
And writes on her hand:
""Every day is a summer's day with you, babe""

There's a guy sitting opposite
Peeking from under his cap
Emma whispers to Casper
""Let's give him something to look at""

Oh, pumpkin pie

It's just scary sometimes
But 'til death and beyond
Baby, you're the one I want
You're the one I want

Emma turns on the TV
Sees the guy from the tram before
He's on a late night talk show
Some kind of troubadour
They ask him where he gets his stories from
He says, ""Well, just today
I saw this couple on the tram
And a story took shape""
How fragile and bold
Isn't young love?
Like skating on a frozen lake
When it's five above

Emma turns off the TV
Looks at Casper yawn
She knows they're more than some characters
In some stupid song

She says 'til death
And beyond
Baby, you're the one I
You're the one I want",Two Young Lovers,2017
Jens Lekman,"I was booked for a wedding on the coast of Finistère
After the rehearsal I took a walk down to the harbor
They say, ""This is where the world ends""
Or maybe where it's beginning
Out on the pier sat the bride on the rail smoking
I wasn't sure if she wanted to talk
But she nodded and waved me in
Her eyes were on the horizon
I asked how she was feeling

She said, ""Like a five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds vanishing""

Is this where the world ends?
Or is it where it's beginning?
You open one door to find all the other doors closing
I said, ""Marry and regret it
Don't marry, regret it too
Whether you marry or you don't
Either way you'll wish you hadn't

We laughed and she dried a tear
We walked back to the town front
And later that night I sang ""You Are the Light""
We all danced and got drunk

I felt like a five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds vanishing

Oh, please, distract me
From every life unlived
Every path I haven't taken
The heart's still a little kid

A scared little five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking

Jens Lekman,"What's that perfume that you wear?
It brings me back somewhere
To the anticipation
Before I kissed someone
It's got a sadness in it
Knowing how it ended
A promise of something so sweet

And it smells so good
That sandalwood
The lavender

From when we stayed at a hotel
And one whiff of that and I'm back there with her
Coming out of the shower, she's still in bed fixing her hair
Says, ""Let's go somewhere""
I can smell her sun lotion
From the window the jasmine
And the salt from the ocean

And it smells so good

I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Jeramy Norris,"The kid heard the word up in Brooklyn.
It was his second year of medical school.
He went and stashed some jeans into his guitar case,
His father said, ""You're a fool"".

But the boy jumped on board a Greyhound bus,
It took him two days to get to Mobile,
And though it took two weeks to track the old man down,
He never doubted that the rumor was real.

But there the old man stood by the store front,
With his white cane hanging from his belt.
And he was bending the steel of his guitar strings
So it seemed like the metal had to melt.

He was the last of the street corner singers
Paying his final years of dues
The voice in his throat was like a bullfrog croak
Yes it's he who invented the blues.

""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm
Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em

When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman
Who you're faithful to for life.""

Well the kid walked up as the blind man finished 
And was bent to put his guitar away.
The old man heard him and said, ""Who are you?""
""I'm the kid you're gonna teach to play.""

The old man laughed but the kid kept talking 'bout
How he'd help him get around
That's when the old man said, 
""I don't need no fool to get me where in the hell I'm bound""

The kid nods his head with a great big grin and says,
""When do we begin?""
That's when the old man said,
""If You're staying with me

This is how it's got to be...""
""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.""
""You know I ain't no guru, 
I'm just a blind black preacher man.
My guitar is my gospel, boy,

And I preach with my picking hand
And I preach with my picking hand
I ain't gonna be your wet nurse,
Or black father to an albino son.""

""That's O.K.,"" the kid up and say,
""I just want to pick like a son of a gun!""
""Whoa, boy, that ain't no damn typewriter you're playing, now.
You've got to caress it like a woman, slow and easy""

""Like this, old man?""
""No! A fool plays the blues like Machine Gun Kelly,
Five hundred notes to the bar,
And if you're going to stick with me

You've got to learn what the blues really are
You learn to pick with me and you can stick with me
But it's time to blow this town.
We gots a gig to preach in a gaming house

We're Alabama bound""
So the kid took the hand of the old blues man
To lead him all around the south
Now it's the old man's turn to make the white boy learn

""You don't play guitar with your mouth""
To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em.
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em.
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.
All right, son, let's hear some guitar.
I want you to play it funky like your uncle's carbuncle.
That's right, son, play it sassy like your sweet mama's pajamas.

That sounds pretty good for a New York boy!
Oh, son that sounds so sweet.",Bluesman,2007
Jere Stormer,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Now I've got to learn to carry on.
I know I cannot hide 
This emptiness inside.
Nothing is the same since you're gone.

Send me strength. Send me love, 
Such sweet love.
Sing me songs that echo in my head and in my heart.

Faith is something I am not accustomed to
Trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there being wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me?
You said, you've always got your hands out
And I can't continue on my own so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin but I built a house and asked to live in it
Afraid to open up the door to you, let you into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring
A man was not created for a God

It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control, I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hold of you and not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling then when I look in the sky, in your eyes, it's amazing

Look, another day another dollar

And I Skype, bet you say ""Lay where my flight at"" 
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at 
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more than hectic 
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort 
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive

Riding shotgun in a old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
'Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock

And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left his ass right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan, I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real north-side nigga living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga a player

Let me talk to 'em
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Look, I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang
Same nigga from the jump
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change

Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be shit, is the shit,
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade, Mrs. Blue
I don't do too much, nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset 'cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on ten
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustle
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Look, I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money, if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having any girl
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed
If everything around you changed
All I need is change

You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
'Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line (The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like ""I got some hoes, hit me back""
Fuck it

You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like ""ahhh""
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work

She says she love me
Then she loves me not
But she don't hate me, if I kick her out my spot
Cause darling lately seems, we've been growing apart
I don't know how much more I can take this
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
But when I look in to her eyes, eyes, eyes, 
Just can't do it, do it, do it

Never felt this before
Could it be that we lost the flame
That them true lovers have
How did it all just slip away? 
Seems so right at the beginning
Now it seems so close to the ending
Like we just friends, I need to breathe again (oh yeah)
These feelings I'm feeling, startin' to drive my crazy
Just the thought of another man making other plans with my lady
And girl I tried and tried hard so we can work  this out
But I just don't know right now

Because at times you say you love me
Then you love me not
But you don't hate me, if I kick you out my spot

Girl when I see your face
It reminds me of the long nights and the good ol' love we made (oh yeah)
And now I just can't forget it, mind stuck with it
Don't remember the last time I hit it
Breathe again, I need to breathe again (oh yeah)
And when I call yah, the voice mail I get (you reached Toya)
And I don't ever want to leave my name and number
Playing these childish games
You wanna freeze again, nah I don't need him again

Well then again
I probably can
I don't know how longer I can be with you
I guess it's all on you

You say you love me

I'm feelin' like I should tip ya the way you're grindin' the pole
You're hot and fresh out the kitchen, here's a taste of that pot of gold
You make me feel like I'm up on a vacation
Cooler than summer breezes
Girl, get your groove back better than in Jamaica

Hope you don't mind if I'm behind that body
Body, body, body, ah ooh
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, do you?

Yeah, we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you

You can get my body, my body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, girl
You can get my body, my body all over your body
Your body all over my body

I love it when you roll
And still manage to clasp that, clasp that ass, clasp that
Just keep the candles on
And maybe I could wax that, wax that ass, wax that

What more can I do
Too speechless to say
They told me that love would
never feel this way

See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si-isodes

No reruns suppose
But then I lied and we stayed in rewind
And Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken
Now I'm broken
Now I'm broken

Can't say I was blind
I seen this before
For your full attention
It seems I'm at war

Consistently more
There's no more to prove
This treasure hunts over
I found all the clues

See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si-isodes

No reruns suppose
But then I lied this heck is divine
And now I'm broken down

Jeremih,"They say good things
Don't last forever
I guess they were right

Guess I really gotta let it go
Telling myself that this just not for me
Here we go around this merry go
Don't you understand that
One of us just gots to leave
So should I close the door
You take the key
Telling me I've been violent
Wishing I could rewind
How this broke heart
I can't believe
Didn't know how to make this work

You know I thought I had it all y'all
It seems that I'm wasting time
Even though I've tried
Guess I've done it all wrong

I wish that I
Wish that I could help us
But I gotta take off, off, off
For once in my life
I gotta take off, off, off
It's time for me to break away

Baby we should let this curtain close
This is really nothing else that's left to show
It's like everytime you look we're starting over
Baby, we done it too many times before
Can't you see I had enough
All my love, maybe you didn't deserve it
Acting like you're miss perfect
I'm manning up, standing up
Cause I know you ain't been doing me right

You know I thought I had it all y'all

What am I doing?
Who do I tell?
I was blinded from the truth
That's why I stayed so long
I should blame myself
Girl, we used to be so close
But I gotta get far away
Baby, maybe we can roll
If I get far away

You know I thought I had it all y'all

Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gone be like ""Boo why we haven't Skyped yet?""
And I Skype, bet you say ""Lay where my flight at""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more than hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive
Women will sell they soul just to buy some attention
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression

Your nail, nails, all on my back
You don't know shawty, I like that
Come on
Let me show you how to ride like that",Ride Like That,2012
Jeremih,"You know I love you like cooked food, I’m a good dude
Let’s hit the Roscoe’s on Pico, I’m in a hood mood
I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc' backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?”
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O
Red bone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

I’m feeling your style
I’m loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You’re killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that",All That (Lady),2012
Jeremih,"You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment, is close

Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vision, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

Tired of livin’ day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that shit, hell
Next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustlin I'm gon’ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes I’m showin'
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the rock I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who err'body gon’ root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where err'body get bodied
They told me get em, I got em
Now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine
If I don't shine, then I don’ eat
Won’t eat, then Ima starve
If I'ma starve, I pull heat
On all yall bitch ass niggas
All y'all rich ass niggas
'Cause if I don’ make no money nigga
I’m gon’ take yo money nigga

Tired of livin’ day to day like everything is alright

Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that shit, hell

Long as I stay hustlin' I'm gon’ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Since life ain’t promised tomorrow
Live it up live it up live it up
Here before it come this far
Give it up give it up give it up
“I won’t” give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, yeah!

That’s the one I’ve got to know
Such a cutie right? Their whole crew is tight
But they don’t do it like her

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talks
Such a cutie right? Their whole crew is tight
But they don’t do it like her

It seems like for a while I’ve know ya
Nostalgic moments feels like magic don’t it
Girl you killin' ‘em, my condolence
That’s how you on it? Yea that’s how you on it
And I’m gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake
With no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush
Love your dimples when you blush
It’s the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What’s yo sign? I’m an Aries, I’m a 90's baby clearly
I’ll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary
Oh oh, hold up, hold up, hold up I just wanna know ya

Well girl my vision’s bad so I’ma need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you 'pose to

Excuse me Misses,
May I spark your interest 'cause you sure got my attention,
I just wanna grant your wishes (la la)
What you want you get it, I don’t call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I’m about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what’s the hold up?
You ain’t ’bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and Escada
Shut it down and you don’t even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating

Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don’t believe it girl, I promise I’ma treat you like my treasure
I’m a movement by myself but I know you’ll make me better

Oh! Hey, there she go
That’s the one I’ve got to know

Oh, oh, pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
I'm thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might

Cause when you walked by, I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye, you’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up

Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up

And If you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance, damn

So, I told her like oh baby

And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening

I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end

Ha your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’

But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me

Oh this the moment they feel ya?
We back on our get down
You see what it is
So lay down, Bad Boy, Blood Line
Get up, talk to 'em

I got tats all on my arm,
Racks on racks in the bank
Forgiatos on my Range, Pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy,
Can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they out ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' wit my whole crew, ball
Hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, ball
Make it rain we don't give a fuck
'Bout what you say, I do this every day
Don't buy bottles, buy bottle case
Seem like every night my birthday
I can't help but get the cake

Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out

Do this err'day, do this err'day

Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rap, just me and my dogs
Straight cash in that haircut
Sea Bass and that lamp chop
Met her at the bar
Tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost
Sippin' red dot with a red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks,
You know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, Illuminati bank rolls
Suicidal Lan' doors, and two Italian tan hoes

Time is callin'

I'm flyin' around and I'm gettin' it
Like 90thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met,
Write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi,
Got these niggas buyin' large lead
Bout to take my LA crib
And drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game,
Like Peach Ciroc and champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets,
And I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion,
Matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin',
Then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, thin tires, envy my entire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart
'Cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga
Was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim,
You ain't like us 'cause we ball

Fuck the truth on that heavy lot
Take that off, take that off
My niggas quick to let that off

Da Vinci kicks with the strap off
This nigga sick like the bad cough

Why ask when I don't want what you like?
Been countin' since all the money on the dash

I just spot hittin'
I throw it up
Actually, booty good as fuck
Take that off, take that off
Stayin' on top of me, this my part
Down down, put it down, let it elevate
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight

Fuck up Mitch, you be limpin'
The green house, the whole team on
On any couches we standing
We tryna live what y'all dream bout
King of diamonds we wearing
Bring the iron, we airing
This thing devours, ain't sharing
All these bitches round me, they starin'
And she hoped in and got crazy
I'm swerving lanes, I'm going 80
I'm zig zaggin' that M6, automatic and stick shift
She more than happy, want a quick fix
I told her grab it, get a quick lick
And I pulled up like my dick in
It got one eye like Slick Rick

Yeah, I ain't got no problems spending no change on it
If she bad enough I'ma tat her up, let me put my name on it
She tells me pull her hair, tell me smack her from the rear
She says she likes it rough, the harder I go it hypes the rush
So you know a nigga pipe the rock,
One or two times is not enough
Then it's one to the next
That means another one bites the dust
Puffin' out, we on that peach Ciroc
Soon as we hit the spot we ride that in homie keep the lot
When she on top she loves to scream a lot
She saying Gillie, Gillie, please don't stop

Only nigga in here asking questions, see only real question, nigga who is you
I ain't worried 'bout it, now I'm on a roll, I don't here nobody, tryna be myself
I made it here, it ain't no miracle, copped the new Ghost, I'm invisible
From January to December, flexin on niggas on the hammer
Tell me what I wanted, I can handle, talk about dirty, that's my grammar
Taladega nights, runnin' through the lights, Ricky Bobby, I be cruisin'
I just did a song with 50 Cent, don't give a fuck about him nigga, two-some
Overseas, talkin' guapanese, twisting lids with big bottles, you know it
As long as you now that

I did not come here from nothin'
I need a whole lot of money
Crossing these hoes out to featherweight
Putting your bitches on layaway
Niggas they know me from stuntin'
All of my whips is push button
Feeling like Phil when I make the play
I light the streets where you are
I only need to hit one time
Keep on them red bottom Louboutin's
Play with that pussy on the 101
I light the streets where you are
I got a bad bitch that's 21
I make her do the things she's never done
