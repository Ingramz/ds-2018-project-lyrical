Nat King Cole,"Your cheating heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheating heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheating heart will tell on you

Your cheating heart will pine some day
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheating heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheating heart will tell on you

Your cheating heart is gonna tell on you",Your Cheatin' Heart,1990
Nat King Cole,"I'm a son of mother nature
A son of father time
I've got a lot of neighbours the million stars that shine
And there all friends of mine

Every robin is my brother 
They sing their songs to me 
The tiny black-eyed daisies
The mighty red wood tree
There all my familly

Then why do I feel so lonely
Like a king on an empty throne
There's one thing that's missing only
A true love to call my own

Won't you listen mother nature
And listen father time
Please help me to find someone
To fill these arms of mine
Mother nature and father time

musical interlude
  
Then why do I feel so lonely
Like a king on an empty throne
There's one thing that's missing only
A true love to call my own

Won't you listen mother nature
And listen father time
Please help me to find someone
To fill these arms of mine
Mother nature and father time
Mother nature and father time",Mother Nature and Father Time,1990
Nat King Cole,"Old Father Time checked, so there'd be no doubt,
Called on the north wind to come on out,
Then cupped his hands, so proudly to shout,
""La-de-da, de-da-de-da, 'tis Autumn!"".

The trees say they're tired, they bore too much fruit,
charmed all the wayside, there's no dispute,
Now shedding leaves, they don't give a hoot!
La-de-da, de-da-de-dum, 'tis Autumn!

Then the birds got together
To chirp about the weather,
After makin' their decision
With birdie-like precision,
turned about and made a bee-line to the south.

Oh, holding you close is really no crime,
Ask the birds, the trees, and Old Father Time,
It's just to help the mercury climb,
La-de-da, de-da-de-da, 'tis Autumn!

Nat King Cole,"You're the cream in my coffee
You're the salt in my stew
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

You're the starch in my collar
You're the lace in my shoe
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

Most men tell love tales
And each phrase dovetails
You've heard each known way
This way is my own way

You're the sail of my love boat
You're the captain and crew
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

Nat King Cole,"When you raise your eyes and make believe,
All the stars come out and paint a world of blue.
There's my heart right up your sleeve
Waiting all for you.

When you smile on me, the world is mine,
And the dreams I dream, I know will all come true.
Every care becomes divine
Waiting all for you.

My heart is beating to the old refrain
When I'm alone with you.
My heart's repeating, ""I'm in love again""
Can't we hold a rendez-vous?

You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything.
Life would be a symphony,
Waiting all for you.

Nat King Cole,"I took a choo-choo-choo-choo fast as I could take a choo-choo,
I've come a long-long-long-long way to take you in my arms.
And now it's your first move to prove that you've been true,
Come to baby, do.

I've been away-way-way-way-way beyond the blue horizon,
I hope that no-no-no-no-no one else is on your mind.
So pucker up, my sweet, and meet your Waterloo,

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone

I love you baby, and I hope you feel the same!

You made me drink, you made me dream,

Nat King Cole,"Love makes me treat you the way that I do,
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?
There's nothing in this world too good

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas,
A diamond ring,
A big Cadillac car, and everything.
What makes me treat you the way that I do?

Nat King Cole,"I'm just a shy guy,
My, I'm a 'fraid-to-try guy
No lie.
There's a gal that I idolize
But I just can't seem to hypnotize.
And when she pets me,
You betcha, it gets me.
And everytime I hold her hand,
I'm just too shy to say the things I plan.
Everytime she's close to me,
My heart is filled with ecstasy,
And like a dope, I let the chance slip by.
There, I should have told her then
But all I did was sit and grin,
And I ended up so mad that I could cry.
'Cause I'm a shy guy
Wish I was a sly guy
Then I could say, ""Baby, baby, I love you""
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do.
I'm just a shy guy
Wish I was a sly guy

Nat King Cole,"Knock me a kiss, you'll never miss
When I'm ready to go.
But if you can't smile and say yes,
Please don't cry and say no!

Squeeze me a squeeze in these fine clothes,
Mm I love you so.
But if you can't smile and say yes,
Please don't cry and say no!

When I ask for a date, the answer is no.
You don't know what you're saying.
Don't you know the war's on,
Everything is rationed, 
How 'bout that jive, keep me alive?

Baby, let bygones be bygones,
'Cause men are scarce as nylons.
And if you can't smile and say yes,
Please don't cry and say no!

Nat King Cole,"My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for furs and laces
My baby don't care for high toned places

My baby don't care for rings
Or other expensive things
She's sensible as can be
My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby's no Crosby fan
Dick Tracy is not her man
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for Mr. Tibbits
She'd rather have me around to kibitz

Roy Rogers is not her style
And even Clark Gable's smile
Is something that she can't see
(Oh, you lucky so and so)
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for me

",Jumpin' at Capitol,1990
Nat King Cole,"I was a humdrum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1990
Nat King Cole,"I'm just a little Jackie Horner
Since I met my sugar cane
That gang of mine has been revealin'
That they're feelin' sore
I left the lamp light on the corner
For the moon in lover's lane
I'm doing things I never did before

When I take my sugar to tea
All the boys are jealous of me
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea

I'm a rowdy-dowdy--that's me
She's a high-hat baby--that's she
So I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea

Ev'ry Sunday afternoon
We forget about our cares
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
With those millionaires

When I take my sugar to tea
I'm as Ritzy as can be
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea",When I Take My Sugar to Tea,1990
Nat King Cole,"I'm gonna sit right down 
And write myself a letter, 
And make believe it came from you.
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off of my feet,
A lot of kisses on the bottom, 
I'll be glad I got 'em.

I'm gonna smile and say, 
""I hope you're feeling better,""
And close with love, the way that you do.
I'm gonna sit right down
And write myself a letter,
And make believe it came from you.

Nat King Cole,"The moon comes out and the sun goes down
Everything in love goes round and round
But my love goes on and on, my love goes on and on
Nothing in the world can change my love for you

Like the cat told the bird on the window sill
I'll be lovin' you from now until
My love goes on and on, my love goes on and on
Nothing' in the world can change my love for you

You keep my heart jumpin' a flip-flop
You keep me feelin' a tip-top
When everything else is long gone
My love will still be goin' strong

You make me mad for a little while
But I get so glad when I see you smile

Nat King Cole,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Just one of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it
When we started painting that town
We'd have been aware that our love affair

Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song

Nat King Cole,"I left her by the River Sainte Marie,
We pledged our love until eternity.
Along the pebbl'd pathway from her door
We kissed and then we kissed again

There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,

Day after day in the fields of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,
Than old Virginny, the place where I was born.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darky's life am passed away.

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,

We ought to be recklessly gay
Who knows what we'll find, so if you're inclined

It may be romance, so while there's a chance

Now whenever you're away
Can't sleep nights and suffer all the day

Silly dreams I knew would disappear,
But it seems they left a souvenir,
One refrain eternally will haunt me, taunt me.

It came from nowhere the night that we met,
T'was like a melodious plea, wee moon song that wasn't meant for me.
Why is it always reminding me of a love dream that never could be.

Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me.
It came gliding into my heart, riding on a moonbeam from above.

A super extraordinary flaperoo!
For years I was a dusty on the well-known shelf,
And really feeling awful sorry for myself!
Poor me, I'm just another blues.

Then someone got the notion that I could revive,
He took away my sadnes and he gave me jive;
He added boogie woogie, and when he got through,
He made my blues a blues that anyone could do;
To me, I'm just another blues.

I'd like to thank you for the boogie ride,
Thank you for the A to the bar.
Now I'm on the solid side,
Biggest attraction by far!

And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,

Maybe Monday, maybe not

His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.

The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.

He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,

When you taught me how to say

And that happy tune is your step

Price we may have to pay. as we fly on to glory,

From a boggy marshland to some...far flung farm. we will be
Cruising at an altitude of several feet 
And flying in a rather attractive v-formation. 
In the unlikely event of an emergency landing, 
We ask that you observe the safety procedures we've been through so many, 
Many times before.

Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gainin' no ground
Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

Angel Eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink, and the laugh's, on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

Tell me how I came to lose your love

Please answer me, my love

If you're happier without me

The autumn leaves of red and gold

Azure-te Lyrics

Gone and got the blues in paris,
Paris blues called azure-te.
How can I be blue in paris? 
Easy, ?cause you?re far away.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

Moments, springtime, eiffel tower,
Funny taxes, kids at play.
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

~interlude~

If you knew how much I need you,
You?d come back to me to stay.
Having you with me in paris
Really is the only way
To lose this blues,
This azure-te.

Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.",Azure-Te,1992
Nat King Cole,"Dance, ballerina, dance
And do your pirouette in rhythm with your achin' heart
Dance, ballerina, dance
You mustn't once forget a dancer has to dance the part

Whirl, ballerina, whirl
And just ignore the chair that's empty in the second row
This is your moment, girl
Although he's not out there applauding as you steal the show

Once you said his love must wait its turn
You wanted fame instead
I guess that's your concern
We live and learn

And love is gone, ballerina, gone
So on with your career; you can't afford a backward glance
Dance on and on and on
A thousand people here have come to see the show
As 'round and 'round you go
So, ballerina, dance
Dance, dance!

It settled softly on the lips you turned to me

We planned together to dream forever
The dream has ended, for true love died
The night a blossom fell and touched two lips that lied

Or it's quiet, or it's mad.
It's a good thing, or it's bad,
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,

I wouldn't mind at all.

It's a problem, or it's play.

Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone, what can matter
No sweet lover man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before

All at once am I
Several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare
They don't bother me
For there's no where else on earth
That I would rather be

Let the time go by
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

Today I'll go to market- 
and buy a lot of fish, 
That will thrill Brother Henry, 
Because that's his special dish.- 
Get a large can of molasses,
 so we'll have something sweet,

he rarely takes a nip, 
He don't need a napkin, 
‘cause the things he eats don't drip.

It really was a bake, 
They started off with some short ribs,
 they finished off with a steak.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

And have you all to myself, alone and apart

Here we are, back together
Happier than before
All I can do is promise
For evermore

Nat King Cole,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Nat King Cole,"""I love you"" you said
Taking my hands
Into your little hands
Of white ivory
And I felt in my chest
A heavy pang
Then a sigh
And next the spark
Of a feverish kiss

Pretty little doll
Of golden hair
Your teeth of pearls
Ruby lips
Tell me if you love me
As I love you
If you remember me
As I do you

Sometimes I hear
A divine echo
Enveloped in the wind
It seems to say
Yes, I really love you
So very much
As much as then
Until I die",Te Quiero Dijiste,1993

Everybody's going there this year,
And there's a reason;

Ever since the USA went dry,
Everybody's going there and I'm going too!

I'm on my way to Cuba,

And where dark eyed Stellas
Light their fella's panatellas.

Cuba, where all is happy,
Cuba, where all is gay!
Why don't you plan a wonderful trip
To Havana?  hop on a ship,
And I'll see you in C-U-B-A.

Take a friend's advice;
Drinking in a cellar isn't nice!
Anybody who has got the price
Should be a Cuban.

Have you been longing for a smile
That you haven't had for quite a while?
If you have, then follow me and I'll
Show the way!

Come on along to Cuba,
That's where I'm going,
Cuba, that's where I'll stay,
Cuba, where wine is flowing,
And where dark eyed Stellas
Light their fella's panatellas.

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.

There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.

O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.

So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away.""

With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
""Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.""

For fooling around with chicks

And I wasn't surprised to hear her say  
That she really went for me  
 
She said I was The Best Man  
Whoever knocked on her door  
She said I was the best man  
The fella she'd waited for

At dancing and nobody can deny 
That when it came to romancing  
I was the a+ number 1 guy  
 
But then she met I best friend  
And knocked him right off his pins  
But still I wasn't worried

That I was best man in the end

And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Singing out a word - to a cattle herd,
'All you bovine creatures - dig what I'm layin' down!

All you sinners drop everything.
Everything
Let the melody and the harmony ring.
Let it ring
Lift arms up to Heaven and sing.
Ring-a-ding
Sing you sinners, won't you sway & swing
What a thing

Start with clapping' y'hands all about.
All about
Don't be silent - Let the Lord hear y'shout
Shout it out
And just let the music come out
Of yer snout
Sing you sinners, wontcha' sway & swing
Check it out
Dig the drift of what I mean

In a world where there's no music - Old Scratch
Satan gets his kicks - He's up to his tricks
He'll be laughing up & down the banks - He, He, He!

To your grave
But if you should want to be saved
Jus' behave

Stop all that chewin' yer cud and all that standin' in the mud there.
Swing, people! Swing every chortle from yer mortal portal.
I dig that everyone believes that cattle prodigies are like a sneeze:
Hard blowin', missin one lick of blowin' talent to show.
If you sing, you gotta swing

Just remember that the day will come 
When you will just be steak on a plate.

Before yer swing arrives too late.

Mrs. Mockingbird, I must say, 
You haven't heard the friendly bellowing swing
Of our friends the cows as they shed their way from Teagarden to Fuller.
Instead of spendin' every day just sneakin' around to lift another lick
These cats work on their cow-tone 
So when they get up to blow a 
Fatter bone-tone

Into the ozone.
And, furthermore

You tweety birds are always singin' away, 
Never givin' up a thought of what you say.
We cows do, shedding takes up most of our day
So when we start and settle in to play we can say:
A moo is an array of what cows have always known as the best and 
Only way to play.

What we mean to say is
Before the band will let you sing
Sing with Fletcher Henderson
You'd better get yourself to swing
Like the Bean or Satch
So your horn can blow a single note or two of deeper thinking
That's the way to swing
So set your mind upon a tone
When you're sheddin' all alone
And you will have a cornerstone
Like the bass trombone 
Blow your horn and take a bow
So that you're swingin' like the cows

What'll I do when you
Are far away
And I'm so blue,
What'll I do?


What'll I do when I
Am wondering who
Is kissing you,
What'll I do?


What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to?


When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true,
What'll I do?

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
Why did I buy those blue pajamas
Before that big affair began?

My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario
I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell
Dwelling in my personal hell

I'll have to change my plan around

Someday soon you'll know
The tears you are tasting
Are years you are wasting,

Youth is so terribly fleeting;
By dancing much faster
You're chancing disaster,
Time alone will show.

The drums are pumpin'
The groove is lockin' in the rhythm like we want it to be

We've gotta keep it in the pocket or we'll stagger behind

You never know just when to leave it when you're riffin' in time
Or if the time itself will falter, or of words even rhyme
But we admit, the trick to it is not to think about it
When you're busy bravin' all the notes in the line

This time we mean it
We're gonna swing it
And take you right up to the end before we try to unwind

I've never been the kind of guy who could just normally quit
Never could decide when to rest my pride
And feel all right with just good enough
Thoughts, they gather
Tellin' me to look to find a bright new way
To assemble all the stimulated motives that haunt me
Tryin' a live it, be in the moment, tryin' to sing it alone
Can beckon to me, a feelin' of being bent
So I believe, takin' a leave is the brightest way to stop
All the chatter boxin' going 'round in my brain
So I'm wailin' - movin' and groovin' this part of this song
I hope that my riff's good enough to keep
Better leave it now or go out of my mind

Now I dig you think that perfect's what we should make it
But I've been down that road and I can tell ya how we feel's
The most important thing about it
Whether you're right or whether you might think
We're pathetic
A little lighter on the reins will help you loosen up the chains
That are still binding you,
In the past, whenever thoughts I had would try to re-
Evaluate all that I would do
I'd hesitate, consolidate, and motivate
All the little pearls of doubt that strive to break up
Every single bit of
Precious joy that flowed from god's soul spark that
Shines within me
That's it in a nut shell
So take advice from this sap, go for feel and leave it alone

Now's the time to sing
Swing is what we bring
Rhythm that's the thing
To really get your spirit movin' higher

Gonna jump and play
Dance the night away
Make you really sway
And let the music take you even higher

E-lla sang this song real special
Come on, come on, we'll sing this special song for you

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.

Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.

And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.","(Ah, the Apple Trees) When the World Was Young",1999

친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어

아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼

It was staring me straight in my eye
I got there I start to unwind
In your arms I like to be 

Caressing you gently and passionately
From sunrise to sunset and all through the day 
I've been waiting for your return 
And you know this is where I'll be
I can say to the world 
I learned only you can satisfy me

I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?","What is this thing called love, song (from ""Wake Up and Dream"")",2002

And closed me inside

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life 
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distant gay traces 
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away 
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren of song 
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness 
Of a great love for me

Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong 

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore

All I care is to smile in spite of it

I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain

And on a very cold and wintery night

Long long ago
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
Long long ago
So when people say to me ""nothings like it used to be""
I don't believe that it's so

They say it was better in so many ways
They didn't have so much to brag about
Long long ago, long ago
Long long ago

Ain't gonna think, think war no more
Ain't gonna fight, fight war no more
We're givin' it up, we gonna let it go

We will take gun powder to have fun
Then get rid of the atom bomb
Something else that we can do
Get rid of all those rockets too

Can build poor people a happy home
Something good we can do

Everybody gets an education
Every time a baby is born
We know he'll have him a happy home

Then we all will shake their hand

Nat King Cole,"Con este tango que es burlon why compadrito
Se ato dos alas la ambision de mi suburbio
Con este tango nacio el cielo why con un grito
Salio del sordido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho carencia
Que abrio caminos sin mas ley que su esperanza
Mesclas de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo jugueton
Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas why las grelas
Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Why un ansia fiera en la manera de querer
Al evocarte, tango querido
Siento que tiembran las baldosas de un bailongo
Why oigo el resongo de mi pasado
Hoy que no tengo
Mas que a mi madre
Siento que llega en punta e' pie para besarme
Cuando tu canto nace al son de un bandoneon....

There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had

Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone

Then they would go out hunting rabbits, 'coons and 'possoms
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something, then again they didn't

And when they would come home, they would find
Flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

Then they would start out lookin' for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards, and they would find axes, wood

Then they would get happy
And start singin' and cryin' this song
They would get happy and do a little boogie-woogie too",Joe Turner's Blues,2006

Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove

If I find peace of mind in the sand and the sea
There's a hope in my heart that you'll soon be with me
There's a prayer that I share with the sand and the sea
And it cries ""come to me, come to me.""

As my eyes search the skies from the edge of the shore
You are here in my arms for a moment or more
Then a tear rushes down to the sand and the sea
And it cries ""come to me, come to me.""

But as long as there's sand, as long as there's sea
As long as there's time I'll wait hopefully
As long as there's heaven up above
Let the sand and the sea bring my love to me

Dealing out the cards from left to right
And the queen of hearts is there to remind me

And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire

The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
Cuz I played my hand so carelessly
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

We'll eat some food that's rare.

I'll place brother Henry's chair-
Invite all the local big dogs,
 We'll laugh and talk and eat, 
But we'll' save the bones for Henry Jones, 
‘cause he don't eat no meat- 

Today I'll go to market- 
and buy a lot of fish, 
That will thrill Brother Henry, 
Because that's his special dish.- 
Get a large can of molasses,
 so we'll have something sweet, 
But save the bones for Henry Jones,

Henry is not a drinker, 
he rarely takes a nip, 
He don't need a napkin, 
‘cause the things he eats don't drip.

It really was a bake, 
They started off with some short ribs,
 they finished off with a steak.

brother henry just kept his seat,

Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.

I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play

She cook me shrimp and rice
These Yankee hot dogs 
Don't treat me stomach very nice.

In Trinidad, one dollar buy 
Papaya juice, banana pie, 
Six coconut, one female goat, 
An' plenty fish to fill de boat. 
One bushel bread, one barrel wine, 
An' all de town, she come to dine. 

But here is bad, one dollar buy 
Cup of coffee, ham on rye. 
Me throat she sick from necktie, 
Me feet hurt from shoes. 
Me pocket full of empty, 
I got Calypso blues.

These Yankee girl give me big scare, 
Is black de root, is blond de hair. 
Her eyelash false, her face is paint, 
And pads are where de girl she ain't! 

She jitterbug when she should waltz, 
I even think her name is false. 
But calypso girl is good a lot, 
Is what you see, is what she got. 

Sittin' by de ocean 
Me heart, she feel so sad, 
Sittin' by de ocean, 
Me heart, she feel so sad
Don't got de money 
To take me back to Trinidad.","Calypso Blues [Produced by Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley & Stephen Marley]",2011
Nat King Cole,"This is a song was sung back in 18 and 92
There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had

Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows
Goats and everything they had on their farm

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone

Then they would go out hunting rabbits, 'coons and 'possoms
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something, then again they didn't

And when they would come home, they would find
Flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

Then they would start out lookin' for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards, and they would find axes, wood
That Joe Turner had brought there for them

Then they would get happy
And start singin' and cryin' this song
They would get happy and do a little boogie-woogie too",Joe Turners Blues,2011

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

To clear up my mind,
Then on to Paris 
For the fun I couldn`t find.
I found I couldn`t leave my memories behind.

Tried seeing Singapore, 
But that wouldn`t do.
Went to Vienna, 
But I found you there, too.
Even in Switzerland, your memory came through.
Where can I go without you?

I wanted travel, I wanted romance,
I chased that rainbow across the sea.
I`m tired of faces, and quaint old places
If you can`t be there with me.

Back on the boat again 
And farewell to France,
Farewell to Londontown,

For just one loving glance.

The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Is in the stardust of a song

When stars are bright
You are in my arms

Nat King Cole Trio,"When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone, what can matter
No sweet lover man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you,

Nat King Cole Trio,"I walk along the street of sorrow, 
The boulevard of broken dreams.
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams.

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow,
When you behold your shattered dreams.
And gigolo and gigolette
Awake to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams.

Here is where you`ll always find me,
Always walking up and down.
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town.

The joy you find here, you borrow,
You cannot keep it long, it seems.
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams.

Nat King Cole Trio,"I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.
Just got the news that my best gal has left me to stay.
Things were pretty rosy,
We got along so fine.
Until another guy moved in 
And handed her a line.
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.

So I decided to try and get her off my mind.
Started to walkin', to see what enjoyment I'd find.
Was invited to a party,
Then there was a fight.
A fella got a whippin',
You guessed it right.
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.",Chant of the Blues (Dog-gone Unlucky Blues),2005

Nat King Cole Trio,"Don't let your eyes go shopping for your heart
They only see the things that are in view
A cover doesn't make a book a work of art
To know its worth you've got to read it through and through

You must realize that rule also applies
To romance when you seek a mate, that's true
Beware of love at sight, take your time, make sure it's right
Don't let your eyes go shopping for your heart

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
