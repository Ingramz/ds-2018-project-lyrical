Shaggy,"You are just another girl
That’s what you are
Just another girl
So nice but not so smart

Just another girl
That’s what you are
Just another girl
So nice but not so smart",Just Another Girl,2012
Shaggy,"Oh yeah yeah
Hey, I hope I hope I hope it's you

A long time I've been alone
The one love I had was thrown away
And that was a shame
I come home and there's no phone calls
The sunset is just the light gone off
With love I'm just lost
But then I saw your face and felt my odds improve
And so I had to brave your filthy magic too

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again
If wishes come true (if wishes come true)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to hold your hand (take your hand)
I'll be sayin' I do (I'll be sayin' I do)
As long as it's you (I hope that it's you)
I hope that it's

I gave up 'cause I've been through it
But you smiled girl and I heard music playing
I ain't been the same (I never been the same)
A long while but I learned some lessons
So this time you'll get the best in me (you're gonna get the best in me)
If this is supposed to be
They say the first time is the deepest love by far
But girl it's looking like the second time's the charm

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again (if I ever feel that light)
If wishes come true (if wishes come true)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to hold your hand (hold your hand)
I'll be sayin' I do (sayin' I do)
As long as it's you (I hope that it's you)
I hope that it's

You got me thinkin' 'bout the future and you know that's not like me
No matter where we go, you make me feel it's where I'm s'posed to be
If I only had a nickel every time I said I'm through
But all the money in the world don't mean a thing if I can't have you

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again (if I ever feel that love light)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
Please let it be you (please let it be you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to take your hand (one chance to take your hand)
Oh I'm sayin' I do (sayin' I do)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)

You got me hopin', girl you got me hopin'
Let's take a chance love, tell me what you think you're gonna do
I hope that it's you (I hope it's you)
Girl here it is so let's make it official (come on)
I need to know now, tell me if you feel like I do
I hope that it's you

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again (oh I hope I feel that light)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
Please let it be you (please let it be you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to take your hand (one chance to take your hand)

Shaggy,"Late night, wake up
I’m sick, I’m stuck
You’re here, so near
Your dream my fear
Your love, my loss
Your dime my cost
My fate, your hands
My life, your brand

Living my life in spite of you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

Nothing’s what we made it
And we’re living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can’t anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I’ve always been dedicated
But I can’t anymore

Girl you know our love is kinda crazy
And no matter what you’re still my lady
Oh
I know you’re fienin up here weekly lately
Ah boy you’ll find a stretch, you’ll never leave me
Oh

When you woke me up and you give me the sweetest wind up
Take someone to loving, if you be young to time uh
Yea, I figured why I was so blind now
Even though your hurt was under surface and me ignored your signs girl

Limbered and teared up, can’t leave me like this
Just give me a chance for me to right this
Girl I know you live my love despite this
Cannot let you go, I got to fight for this

Nothing’s what we made it
And we’re living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can’t anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I’ve always been dedicated
But I can’t anymore

It’s not right 'cause you’re saying this
I wasn’t born to serve you
I was born to love

Your house, your rules
Keep calm, keep cool
Tip toe, steer clear
Your mask, I wear
Your wants, my needs
Loaded, good deeds
Your frown, my smile
You’re up, I’m down

Living my life in spite of you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

Nothing’s what we made it
And we’re living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can’t anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I’ve always been dedicated
But I can’t anymore

Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk the streets alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all

Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me

Viendo el sol y el atardecer
Sentados solos frente al mar
Tu besándome y yo besándote
Disfrutamos de un momento especial

Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Yo quiero hacerte el amor
Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Aprovechemos que ya se escondió el sol

Entremos al agua tu y yo
Sin ropa y comámonos los dos
Tu me gustas mucho y lo sabes
Como tu no existe nadie

Ya casi se esconde el sol
Y quiero abrazarte mi amor
Estamos entrando en calor
Vamonos para el agua los dos

Me want to see you when the sun a come down
Baby girl no bother walk, just run come
Say rum a drink, make have fun
I'll be there for you when it's all done
Girl me nah lie
Love how you shape the way you're design
When you a bubble and your waistline
You know Mr. lover lover
Nah waste time.

Aprovechemos que ya se escondió el sol

Te gusta sentir la arena en tu piel
Cuando me toca tu y a la vez el sol cayendo
Tu boquita rica sabe a miel
Y no me puedo contener, por que el alcohol esta subiendo

No se tu me estas enloqueciendo
La brisa acaricia tu pelo
Las estrellas alumbran el cielo
Vamos hasta el amanecer solos tu y yo

Viendo el sol y el atardecer
Sentados solos frente al mar
Tu besándome y yo besándote
Disfrutamos de un momento especial

Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Yo quiero hacerte el amor
Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh

This court is called to order
These charges are serious
Stand up and face the bench
What do you plead, Sir? What do you plead?

“Guilty as charged,” the Judge decreed, “stand up and face the bench
I have some words to say to you before we recommence
A list of crimes this serious, I swear I have not seen
In all the years that I have served Her Majesty the Queen

Arson, murder, blackmail, grand larceny and theft
Drug dealing, human trafficking, I ask the court, what’s left?
Are there words of mitigation, before I pass the sentence?
Anything that you can tell the court to add to your defense?”

I faced the court, thought long and hard before I gave reply
“There’s something that you need to hear, from me before I die
The circumstances of my birth were something short of bliss
I have this from my mother, it was told to me like this

The day that I was born, she said, The Good Lord woke from slumber
Looking ‘round his timber yard, He found He had no lumber
Apart from some old twisted branch, in shadows left to lurk
He pulled it out into the light and set about his work.

She told me that the world should not expect too much of me
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree.”

“Stand up and face the bench
I’ve heard all you’ve got to say
That there look on your face says you’re guilty
And now it’s your judgment day.”

“I’m not asking for forgiveness
I’m not proud of what I’ve done
I did the things I had to do, like any other mother’s son
None of us are perfect, so remember what you see
When the Good Lord carved this crooked soul, out of a crooked tree

I’d take a little solo, I’d play for her, she’d smile, return the favor
I’d make the sweetest love to her with every semiquaver

“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said
“That penetrates my bones
Something in your intonation, something in your tone
Always understated, but never overblown
My name for you is Sad Trombone
Yes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”

It seemed like she’d found the secret key to my soul
And gathered up my broken life and somehow made me whole
We’d share a room together, my bandmates were all green
And they warned me ‘bout some story in a movie they’d all seen

“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said
“That penetrates my bones
Something in your intonation, something in your tone
Always understated, never overblown
My name for you is Sad Trombone
Yes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”

Now when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close
That’s when the heartbeat race
Sadness on your face, and you can’t take no more
I see you searching for your smile
We haven’t seen that in a while
Now when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close
That’s Sad Trombone

We never made much money, the ticket counts were light
We’d count the bars until we reached some hotel for the night
She was my morning coffee, the butter on my toast
‘Til she got a better offer from some outfit on the coast

Oh, there’s a sadness in my playing now
A desperate cry, a moan
Something in my choice of notes
Something in my tone
Sliding to the deepest bass from a lonely baritone
I guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone
I guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone

It’s an old, old story, and one you’ve probably heard
You start out in a major key, then you’re down a minor third
Aimlessly sliding, sinking like a stone
It doesn’t get no deeper, than the scraps that you’ve been thrown
But some things they just stay with you, long after they have flown
And it always comes back down, to the bone
And it always comes back down, to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone",Sad Trombone,2018

Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches
Which is why you don't invite mine to your parties
Just 'cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're just a bunch of hot shots
They act like they ain't never seen a Cyclops

And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, what's up with that?

Try to play me out just 'cause I'm an albino
Or maybe it's the sack growin' out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
I'm popping in like a pound of lead
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head

Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two, my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone

Just two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Just 'cause my nose curl up like the iron shriek
Is that the reason nobody wanna hang, fuck It

Cop a magnum 
Go to school with one intention 
Everybody freeze, on your knees, hold it 
Dumb motherfucker, forgot to load it 
Would you, could you 
Get a blade 
Feel all bad cause you got a little played 
Got a beef? Many blew it 
Here's your wrist and blade 
Now do it!

Come on just do it (x5) 

Do you have the heart? 
Do you have the soul? 
When it boils down to it 
Are you able to do it? 
Will you have a conscience? 
Will you live in fear?

Are you able to do it?

Shaggy 2 Dope,"I'm neva gonna die cause I belong alive
I'm the muntha fuckin proof only the strong survive
I've never been in Folcom I never changed to apease
Never gonna car crash or catch a lame disease
You'll always see me on a trycicle big as a car
Tricked out with three fat bithces on the handle bars
A mutha fuckin clown pimp, never passin away
And I'll ALWAYS be your homie from way back in the day
Death can't have this cause I'm quicker than bullets,
Red necks try to hide from me sniffin they mullets
But I can spot them out fast pack a hurt until it bottoms out
Never take a ride in one myself that's what I'm talkin about
Nope, never leavin I'll never stop breathin
I'll always be a heathin never leave my momma grieven
I'll never get old, never get week forever more
I run the under ground from here to equidore
NEVA GONNA DIE

(X4)
I'm forever and ever and ever, Forever always

I'll never fade to black, never replay the shit I say
You can't find me box me or burry me away
I'm on the south west side son runnin down Casper
Bein chased by some thugs in a car I run faster
I'm never gonna die cause I'm part of somethin bigger
Never gonna flat line, never need no grave digger
This the real whicked shit from Detroit, the running man
When the summer streets heat up and the murdas come again
I'm never gonna die slow, I'm never goin quick
Never leave the world as long as fat chicks blowin dick
I'll never die broke or ritch, I'll never die at all,
I'll be here the mutha fuckin sky falls
Let the floor collaps I'll forever drop with it
I'll never lose signal never stop transmittin
I will never die put that on ""All that I got""
Forever chokin that sripper tie it all in a knot
I WILL NEVA DIE

Swan divin off the renisance with out a parachute
You gotta see me smack the floor see me bounce back for more
See me parasalein through the biggest hurricane you ever saw
I'm never gonna die, put that on a commet in the sky
When it smaches in the Earth I jumpin on to catch a ride
Every year I'll still be here but from another stratusphere
I'll neva die and though I hope you fuckers know now that is clear
I'M NEVA GONNA DIE

Your karma... Its all about karma... (x2, then another x2 in background of next line)

Your life, your life, your liiiii...i-iiii...i-ife

VERSE 1
I awake, floatin 3 feet off my bed,
An old cardboard box, no shoes, no socks,
But lots of karma, I'm smiley-whilin,
Giddy-as-fuck, though grimey-stylin.
I gots no home, I gots no bones,
Just happy to be alive and checkin payphones,
For a quarter over here, a nickel over there,
Flat broke, but I got a lot of karma to share.

CHORUS
I can make mountains get up and move out my way,
Hear that paradise has offered me a place to stay,
I don't waste a day, I don't starve for nothing,
I'm the karma millionaire, always happy 'bout something.
I say live out your days coz you ain't gettin shit back,
Bitch around me will only get you your lip smacked,
Karma over any drug dealers supply,
Coz I can do anything with it except die.

VERSE 2
The bail man's tryin to find me, I'm deep into thoughts,
And I bounce everytime a car passes with the bumps,
I'm the hobo with all the jokes to tell,
Full of karma through the roof and I'm broke as hell.
Whether the life slows down, or if it throws down,
I'm beaming karma and I'm glad to be around,
This city get cold as ice, I'm out there,
But my karma keep me warm like some thermal underwear.

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT ""Your Life..."" x2

VERSE 3
Let me see a bad weather, I got sunshine for ya,
Front me with that sad shit, I'll fuckin ignore ya,
My days are always fly days,
I like everybody else on them over-crowded highways.
I says karma's worth more than money or love,
Or any of the above,
Mine blows off, and shows off my charisma,
Happy nobody here that say that there is none.

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT ""Your Life..."" x2

Ain't nobody placed on this earth for nothin, } X

Shaggy 2 Dope,"Now if you got yo hat tilted to tha side
And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary
With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree
Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets
Then you might be
Gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

[Chorus x2]
You might be (what!? what!?)
You might be gang related!

Do you wear a hatchetman?
You in a gang and yo ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep tha jrb and you will never switch
(jrb?) juggalo rydas bitch!
Did you beat your girlfriends who dissed your boys
Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

[Chorus x4]

Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do
I'm only tryin' to say you gang related too bitch!
Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

[Chorus x4]

Ah ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha! you know what man? you just might be!
In spite of your own knowledge of 'em
A gangsta, gangobodacious, smacksimus

With still no sign of you

The touchin', the kissin', is what I'm truly missin'

To feel your body close to mine

I really tried to fight it, didn't think I would fall

I really think she's the one for me
The type of girl that makes me wanna give up other people's property
I really, really like the way that I feel and the way that I feel for you is for real

All I wanna do is be good to you
And give you all the love I wanna give to you
I hope you realize that this feelin' is right

That what you do affects the stars above
And the earth and the moon and the sun

That me and you represent peace and love

You've got to find what you're here for
So if you just know yourself everything else will flow

Just let us enter your soul
And if you know like we know

Why should I strive for acceptance and peace of mind.

Know the flame is dead and will no longer burn 
This body will never pain again 
This mind knows no wound 
Though I am of flesh this flesh will not consume me 
As it has destroyed so many before 
This body will never pain again 
This mind knows no wound

For I can Breathe my blood is fire and I bleed life 
The defeatest is dead 
No remorse for that man who dies 
A sad bitter man whose contempt for himself exceded his contempt for the world 
No remorse for those who chis spirit 
A sad bitter lot whose lack of insight left a man broken 
Left many broken 
The disenchanted led by the frightened only blessed

Under the misguiding light of faulty beacons.

With vices for virtues,
Against the wind,

And excess for etiquette,

Ignorant of it's weight.

Blind to it's worth.

Is nothing but a burden.

This burden is a child.
This burden is a life

Women without conviction

Teaching respect and compassion.
No.

Shai Hulud,"I will walk with you, my friend, in the search for insight.

Let truth be told,
If not malicious, the nature of humanity is volatile,
Often thoughtlessly brought to irrational ends.
And I have mused on the future that may effect.
Dark times designed of dark minds.

Now please walk with me, my friend,
This is what I believe and know to be true.

I believe and know fear runs deeper than reason,
That rampant weakness is veiled by aggression.

I believe and know defeat is the order of man,
Resting well in euphemism and excuse
In biting reality, eternally sleepless.

No, I do not believe roses only bloom just to conceal the thorns.
I merely accept the thorn pricked finger bleeds.

It is foolish to think the adder benign.

Let us walk together in acute perception, wake insight from sleep
Outside of doctrines, anchored in bitter reality.

I will walk with you, my friend. 

We will walk.",Think the Adder Benign,2013
Shai Hulud,"To suffer fools is to exist
Bounded by those who deem themselves wise.
Never veil your eyes, turn deaf, or disconnect your mind.
Clash, and clash hard.

We suffer fools

From the flat Earth drifting away into warm delusion.
See it fit to have them forced back down.
Slammed into the clay.
Fathoms deep.

The fool always claims to know.
Steeped in misbelief,
Fool, never claim to know.
Your ideas are wrong.

Pour the salts of acumen straight into the eyes to recondition the mind.

We suffer.",To Suffer Fools,2013
Shai Linne,"Once and for all
Once and for all
You offered up your life
For one and all
For one and all
The perfect sacrifice

Atoning blood was shed
Love conquered when You said

[Chorus]
It is finished, It is done
To the world Salvation comes
Hallelujah, we're alive!
Hell was silent when you cried:
It is finished
It is finished

Who is this King
Who is this King
So mighty and so strong
He is the One
He is the One
The earth has waited for

God's remedy for sin
With mercy for all men

[Chorus]

The earth shook and trembled
The sun bowed it's head
The veil of the temple was open for men
As Jesus went down in the cold of the grave
Defeated the darkness when He overcame
The keys of the Kingdom were placed into hands
Of children and priests and of fishers of men
Through all generations His voice will be heard
Creation resounds the victorious words!

It is finished, it is done
To the world Salvation comes
Hallelujah, we're alive!
Hell was silenced when you cried:

It is finished
It is done
Now completed, the work of Love
Hallelujah, He's alive!

Quiero decirte
Me voy, te vas, no importa más porque al final
Ya me cansaste

Crees que me enredo en tus mentiras
No quiero ocultar heridas
¡Sal de mi vida!
No soy la misma

Amor, amor, amor, amor, amor
Cómo pudiste
Mentir, jugar, herir, callar, fingir, amar
Cómo pudiste

Crees que me enredo en tus mentiras,
No quiero ocultar heridas
¡Sal de mi vida!

No me interesa si me vienes a rogar
No me interesa si es mentira o si es verdad
¡No me interesa!

No me interesa discutir de esto después
No me interesa si te mueres de una vez
¡No me interesa!
Date la vuelta

Amor, amor, amor, amor, amor
No he terminado
Ya me encontré con el calor y la pasión
En otro lado

Ya no me importan tus mentiras
Quédate con tus tequilas
Y yo hago mi vida

No me interesa si me vienes a rogar,
No me interesa si es mentira o si es verdad
¡No me interesa!

No me interesa discutir de esto después,
No me interesa si te mueres de una vez
¡No me interesa!

He accepts her invitation, ""wanna spend some time?""

And you'd think he couldn't fail to read between the line
Plays the fool instead

A brave new world has dawned upon the human race,
Where words are meaning less, and everything's surreal.
Gonna have to reach my friends to find out how I feel.
And if I taste the honey - is it really sweet?
And do I eat it with my hands or with my feet?
Does anybody really listen when I speak,
Or will I have to say it all again next week?

Is there anybody out there?
Help me sing my song.

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

Necesito una razón
Y es difícil creer 
Que no exista una más que este amor

Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Que a pesar de que dicen que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo que pasé junto a ti
Dejó tejido su hilo dentro de mí

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos

Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas

Y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar
Lo que es amar",Antologia,1996

Y quiero pensar
Que no tardaras
Porque en el planeta no existe
Mas nadie a quien puedo yo amar

Te busque en al armario
En al abecedario
Debajo del carro
En el negro en el blanco

En cuadros de Botero
En mi monedero
En dos mil religiones
Te busque hasta en mis canciones",Donde Estas Corazon,1996

Que se nuble cada cielo y que llueva hasta hacer charcos

Y abrazarte con tal fuerza que te parta hasta los huesos

Shakira,"Se me acaba el argumento
Y la metodología
Cada vez que se aparece frente
A mí tu anatomía

Por que este amor ya no entiende
De consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos
Y le faltan pantalones
Este amor no me permite
Estar en pie
Por que ya hasta me ha quebrado
Los talones
Aunque me levante volveré a caer
Si te acercas nada es útil
Para esta inútil

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa mas que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no se como olvidarte
Cuántas veces he intentado
Enterrarte en mi memoria
Y aunque diga ya no más
Es otra vez la misma historia
Por que este amor siempre sabe
Hacerme respirar profundo
Ya me trae por la izquierda
Y de pelea con el mundo

Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón
Y esconderme para no sentirme
Nuevamente

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa mas que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no se como olvidarte

Ojerosa, flaca, fea desgreñada
Torpe, tonta, lenta, nécia, desquiciada
Completamente descontrolada
Tu te das cuenta y no me dices nada
Se me ha vuelto
La cabeza un nido
Donde solamente tu tienes asilo
Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa mas que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no se como olvidarte

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido

Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no se como olvidarte","Ciega, Sordomuda",1998
Shakira,"Los han visto por ahí
Los han visto en los tejados
Dando vueltas en Paris
Condenando en los juzgados

Con la nariz empolvada
De corbata o de blue jeans
Los han visto en las portadas todas
Sin mas nada que decir

¿Dónde están los ladrones?
¿Dónde esta el asesino?
Quizá allá revolcándose
En el patio del vecino
Y qué pasa si son ellos
Y qué pasa si soy yo
El que toca esta guitarra
O la que canta esta canción
La que canta esta canción

Los han visto de rodillas
Sentados o de cuclillas
Parados dando lecciones
En todas las posiciones
Predicando en las iglesias
Hasta ofreciendo conciertos
Los han visto en los cocteles todos
Repartiendo ministerios

¿Dónde están los ladrones?
¿Dónde esta el asesino?
Quizá allá revolcándose
En el patio del vecino
Y qué pasa si son ellos
Y qué pasa si soy yo

Shakira,"Si es cuestión de confesar
No sé preparar café
Y no entiendo de fútbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parqués
Y jamás uso reloj

Y para ser más franca nadie piensa en ti 
Como lo hago yo
Aunque te dé lo mismo

Si es cuestión de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que también
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frío

Conmigo nada es fácil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
(Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido)

El cielo está cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote 
Es inevitable

Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo
Ya sabrás la situación
Aquí todo está peor
Pero al menos aún respiro

No tienes que decirlo
No vas a volver
Te conozco bien
(Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo)

El cielo está cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más
Parecido a ayer

Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo",Inevitable,1998
Shakira,"Mis días sin ti son tan oscuros
Tan largos tan grises
Mis días sin ti

Mis días sin ti son
Tan absurdos
Tan agrios tan duros
Mis días sin ti

Mis días sin ti
No tienen noches
Si alguna aparece es inútil
Dormir

Mis días sin ti son un derroche
Las horas no tienen principio ni fin

Tan faltos de aire
Tan llenos de nada
Chatarra inservible
Basura en el suelo
Moscas en la casa

Mis días sin ti son como un cielo
Sin lunas plateadas
Ni rastros de sol

Mis días sin ti son solo un eco
Que siempre repite la misma canción

Tan faltos de aire
Tan llenos de nada
Chatarra inservible
Basura en el suelo
Moscas en la casa

Pateando las piedras
Aún sigo esperando que vuelvas conmigo
Aún sigo buscando
En las caras de ancianos
Pedazos de niño

Cazando motivos que me hagan creer
Que aún me encuentro con vida,
Mordiendo mis uñas
Ahogándome en llanto
Extrañándote tanto

Mis días sin ti
Mis días sin ti
Mis días sin ti
Como duelen los días sin ti
Sin ti
Sin ti",Moscas en la Casa,1998
Shakira,"Sólo tú sabes bien quien soy
Y por eso es tuyo mí corazón
Sólo tú doblas mi razón
Y por eso a donde tú quieras voy

No creo que el mar algún día
Pierda el sabor a sal

No creo en el azar

Sólo creo en tu sonrisa azul
En tu mirada de cristal
En los besos que me das
Y en todo lo que digas

Sólo tú doblas mi razón
Y por eso a donde tú quieras voy

No dejes de lado
Que nadie más te amará así

Quiero ser tu firmamento
De tu boca una canción
De tus alas siempre ser el viento

Tu terrón de sal
Un rayo de sol
Que a donde digas que tú
Quieras que yo vaya voy
Eres mi desliz, mi país feliz
Mi primavera
Mi escalera al cielo si
Por eso sigo aquí y camino
Contigo a tí nunca podría decirte que no

Y ahora si que no
Puedo vivir sin ellos yo

Shakira,"Y que voy a hacer con mi despiste selectivo
Y con mi sueño frustrado de aprender a cocinar
Y que voy a hacer con los Domingos
Y feriados ningún plan es apropiado
Cuando intento no pensar

Dime acaso a dónde vas
Ahora que no estoy
Dime acaso a dónde voy
Ahora que no estas

Que me inventare para decirle al mundo
Entero si me ven tumbada al suelo
Y sin mas ganas de volar
Cómo escondo este par de alas rotas
Y las suelas de mis botas cansadas
De caminar

Dime acaso a dónde vas
Ahora que no estoy
Dime acaso a dónde voy
Ahora que no estas

Yo quiero que vuelvas
Que te están reclamando
Mis labios que hace tiempo no besas
Yo quiero que regreses
Ya ves que hasta mis manos
De tanto no tocarte me duelen me duelen

Y que voy a hacer si mi barbilla llega al piso
Y aunque intente la sonrisa no me sale natural
Si ya me han visto con la mirada perdida
Unas cuantas libras menos
Y unas lagrimas de mas

Dime acaso a dónde vas
Ahora que no estoy
Dime acaso a dónde voy
Ahora que no estas

Shakira,"Cuéntame que harás después que estrenes su cuerpo
Cuándo muera tu traviesa curiosidad
Cuándo memorices todos sus recobecos
Y decidas otra vez regresar
Ya no estaré aquí en el mismo lugar

Si no tiene más que un par de dedos de frente
Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes
Si te quita los pocos centavos que tienes
Y luego te deja sólo tal como quiere

Sé que volverás el día
En que ella te haga trizas
Sin almohadas para llorar
Pero si te has decidido
Y no quieres más conmigo
Nada ahora puede importar
Porque sin ti 
El mundo ya me da igual

Si te vas, si te vas, si te marchas
Mi cielo se hará gris
Si te vas, si te vas, ya no tienes
Que venir por mí
Si te vas, si te vas, y me cambias
Por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero
No vuelvas nunca más
Ya no estaré aquí

Toda escoba nueva siempre barre bien
Luego vas a ver desgastadas las cerdas
Cuándo las arrugas le corten la piel
Y la celulitis invada sus piernas

Volverás desde tu infierno
Con el rabo entre los cuernos
Implorando una vez más
Pero para ese entonces
Yo estaré un millón de noches
Lejos de esta enorme ciudad
Lejos de ti 
El mundo ya me da igual

Shakira,"Voy a dejar 
Que mi guitarra diga todo lo que yo
No se decir por mi
O quizás deba esperar
A que el insulto del reloj
Acabe de planear mi fin
Duelen tanto las sonrisas
Cuesta un mundo respirar
Es que no tenerte aquí ya me hace mal

Me sigue rodeando
La sombra de ti
Y siguen rodando por ahí
Todas las palabras que dijimos
Y los besos que nos dimos
Como siempre
Hoy estoy
Pensando en ti

Debes saber
Que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
Regados por aquí
Y que tropiezo cada día sin pensar
Con un viejo recuerdo mas
Y alguna nueva historia gris
Si no puedo estar contigo
Ya no puedo estar sin ti
Cada vez se hace mas duro ser feliz

Porque eres tu mi sol
La fe con que vivo
La potencia de mi voz
Los pies con que camino
Eres tu amor
Mis ganas de reír
El adiós que no sabre decir

Alejarte nuevamente de aquí

Te regalo mi nariz

Nunca come en exceso why jamas duerme desnudo
Siempre viste de gris, pues no tiene remedio
La tendencia a buscarse siempre el punto intermedio

Dana es niña de bien
(Eso dicen sus padres)
Nunca llega a su casa a mas de diez ni muy tarde
Braulio why Dana se quieren como cualquier pareja
Pero un día fueron presa de la naturaleza
Why de sus propios instintos, no escaparon con suerte

Con el fuego por dentro
Why las hormonas presentes
Por la ley del magneto
Se acercaron los cuerpos

Pero si a la hora del té nada pasa
Solo te irás lejos de casa
Por haber traído un habitante más
A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
Donde lo que no se quiere se mata
Se mata, se mata, se mata

Ese día llegaste un poco mas de las diez
Pero el susto se dio unas semanas después
Cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
Un niño nacería why ya sabías la fecha

why antes que el vecino why la familia supieran
Fuiste donde el doctor a acabar con el problema
Tu vecino esta en casa dándose un buen duchazo
Why tu dos metros bajo tierra viendo crecer gusanos

Pero si a la hora del té nada pasa
Solo te irás lejos de casa
Por haber traído un habitante más
A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
Donde lo que no se quiere se mata

Ship that sunk in the desert

Each single morning
So I count on someone on Friday nights
To take me dancing and then
To church on Sundays
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids
Or maybe just to save a little money

You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

In the world full of strangers
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook and finally lose
My kitchen phobia
And so I got the arms to cuddle in
When there's a ghost or a muse
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs
To write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone

You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me I'm holding on

Shakira,"You're too far to bring you close
And too high to see below
Just hangin' on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
Start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
'Cause to talk to you is harder work

So what's the point of wasting all my words
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
I bet you'll find someone like you
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe
I wish you luck but I've other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain

So I count on someone on Friday nights
To take me dancing and then
To church on Sundays
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids
Or maybe just to save a little money

The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

In the world full of strangers
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook and finally lose
My kitchen phobia
And so I got the arms to cuddle in
When there's a ghost or a muse
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs
To write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone

Y la metodología
Cada vez que se aparece frente
A mí tu anatomía

Por que este amor ya no entiende
De consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos
Y le faltan pantalones
Este amor no me permite
Estar en pie
Por que ya hasta me ha quebrado
Los talones
Aunque me levante volveré a caer
Si te acercas nada es útil
Para esta inútil

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda

Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no se como olvidarte
Cuántas veces he intentado
Enterrarte en mi memoria
Y aunque diga ya no más
Es otra vez la misma historia
Por que este amor siempre sabe
Hacerme respirar profundo
Ya me trae por la izquierda
Y de pelea con el mundo

Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón
Y esconderme para no sentirme

Torpe, tonta, lenta, nécia, desquiciada

Donde solamente tu tienes asilo
Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
Start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell

Shakira,"It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me you don't care

Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
But you gotta know small things also count
You better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about

So objection, I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to run away

I wish you
(There was a chance for you and me)
I wish
(You couldn't find a place to be)
Away from here

This is pathetic and sardonic, it's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three, was never meant to be
But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse
But don't you count on me, don't you count on me boy

So objection, I don't want to be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away
Get away, get away
Eh, eh, eh, get away

I'm falling apart in your hands again

No way

Con la luna en mi nariz

En tus ojos me perdí

Que torpe distracción
Y que dulce sensación

Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
Como eneas y benitin
Ya te encontré varios rasguños
Que te hicieron por ahí

Pero mi loco amor
Es tu mejor doctor

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo
Y todo va a pasar
Pronto verás el sol brillar

Tú más que nadie merece ser feliz

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
Hasta en tu propio país
Si yo te digo ¿qué dices tu?
Tu aún dices ¿que decís?
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razón que hace doler tu corazón
Por eso quise hacerte esta canción

Ya vas a ver como va

Quiero creer en otra oportunidad
Dimos un salto mortal
Y hoy vuelvo a ver
Un faro en la oscuridad

Ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
Solo la ilusión trae desilusión
Y es tan fácil de caer

Lo eterno y lo fugaz
Prefiero darle fin
Aunque me ocultes la verdad más vulnerable

When we were dreaming easy
Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky
There was nothing we could sell or buy

Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly

What do you think, darling?
Have we lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt melancholy, darling

Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears and our dreams for plans?

Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared?
And when love was on our side
On our side

When we could spend our evening
Staring at the ceiling, lying on the floor
My vocabulary wasn't broad
I spoke so little English
And the word ""stress"" would sound like something odd

Si ya sabes cual es la respuesta
Desde el momento en que te vi
Se a lo que voy

Yo me propongo ser de ti
Una victima casi perfecta
Yo me propongo ser de ti
Un volcán hoy

El amor tal vez
Es un mal común
Y así como ves
Estoy viva aun
Será cuestión de suerte

Creo que empiezo a entender
Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer
Que nos deseábamos desde antes de nacer
Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer
Tengo el presentimiento de que empieza la acción
Adentro, adentro, te vas quedando
Y las mujeres somos las de la intuición
Así, estoy dispuesta a todo amor

Yo te propongo un desliz
Un error convertido en acierto
Yo me propongo ser de ti
Un volcán hoy

Es mal común
Y así come ves
Estoy viva aun

Voy de paso
Por este mundo fugaz

No pretendo parar
¿Dime quién camina
Cuando se puede volar?

Mi destino es andar
Mis recuerdos
Son una estela en el mar

Lo que tengo, lo doy
Digo lo que pienso
Tómame como soy

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir
A contramano
No intentes amarrarme
Ni dominarme
Yo soy quien elige
Como equivocarme

Aprovechame
que si llegué ayer
Me puedo ir mañana
Que soy gitana
Que soy gitana

Sigo siendo aprendiz
En cada beso
Y con cada cicatriz

Algo pude entender
De tanto que tropiezo
Ya sé como caer

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir
A contramano
No intentes amarrarme
Ni dominarme
Yo soy quien elige
Como equivocarme

Aprovechame
Que si llegué ayer
Me puedo ir mañana
Que soy gitana

Vamos y vemos
Que la vida es un goce
Es normal que le temas
A lo que no conoces

Tómame y vamos
Que la vida es un goce
Es normal que le temas
A lo que no conoces
Quiero verte volar
Quiero verte volar

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir

Shakira,"Para amarte necesito una razón
Y es difícil creer 
Que no exista una más que este amor

Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Que a pesar de que dicen
Que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo que pasé junto a ti
Dejó tejido su hilo dentro de mí

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos

Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Y me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas

Y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar
Lo que es amar

Lo que es amar
Lo que es amar
Lo que es amar
Lo que es amar
Lo que es amar",Antologia [Album Version] [Version],2010
Shakira,"S-O-S she is in disguise
S-O-S she is in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise,
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me,
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
Moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body is craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday
And Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution 
or decent incentives to keep me at it
Starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (ahoo)
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
To get me a lover and tell you about it

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set her free (ahoo)
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breath 

Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey,
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent,
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single man 
I've got on me a special radar,
And the fire department's hot line 
in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divas 
or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
I'm having a very good time 
and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set her free (ahoo)
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breath 

S-O-S she is in disguise

Y hoy soy el guardián de sus sueños de amor

La quiero a morir

Pueden destrozar todo aquello que ven
Porque ella en un soplo lo vuelve a crear
Como si nada, como si nada

La quiero a morir

Ella para las horas de cada reloj
Y me ayuda a pintar transparente el dolor
Con su sonrisa

Y levanta una torre desde el cielo hasta aquí
Y me coce unas alas y me ayuda a subir
A toda prisa, a toda prisa

La quiero a morir

Conoce bien cada guerra
Cada herida, cada ser
Conoce bien cada guerra
De la vida y del amor también

Moi je n'étais rien et voilà qu'aujourd'hui
Je suis le gardien du sommeil de ses nuits

Elle n'a qu'à ouvrir l'espace de ses bras
Pour tout reconstruire, pour tout reconstruire

Je l'aime à mourir

Elle a gommé les chiffres des horloges du quartier
Elle a fait de ma vie des cocottes en papier
Des éclats de rire

Elle a bâti des ponts entre nous et le ciel
Et nous les traversons à chaque fois qu'elle

Shakira,"Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive
Someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space
A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust
How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no
As long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways

There were nights that I stayed up crying
'Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey, do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do, as I did then
When you were only 23

Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true

Do you believe in destiny?

Que todavía estas aquí
Aun quiero seguir loca por ti

Falta todo si faltas tu
Imagino tu cuerpo aquí
Con la luna a contra luz
Me quedare, bebiendo esta copa a tu salud

Mis lagrimas caerán
Y entre la lluvia se confundirán

Shakira,"And I feel again losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No you won't see me popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade

Searching for islands were we could land
Too far away to be found
We took off our gloves and danced like if we've gone mad
Took a dip in the ocean
To wash away all the sand

I'm not alone
Not anymore this time
I found my love
Under a coconut tree

Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a tree
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree
Uuh
Uuh
Uuh

It's like we designed the anatomy of a dream
As crazy in love as we'll ever be
Inside a fantasy
Under the stars
Floating above the sea
And we were lost like
We always dreamt to be

I'm not alone
I say to myself
I found my home
Under a coconut tree

Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a dream
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree
Uuh

No me dejas ser infeliz a pesar de mis intentos
Eres como un querubín que vuela y vuela y vuela
Cantando canciones de amor cerca de mí aunque me duela

Es el sol detrás de tu risa
Que me ciega y me deslumbra
Y tu piel que roza la mía
Pero aún no se acostumbra
Es la luz detrás de tus ojos
Que ilumina mi penumbra
Y que va brillando más fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz

Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
No dejas un respiro a mi corazón
Tú me armas, me desarmas
Nunca me dejas caer
Tan bajo me levantas

Para mí este mundo sin tí no sería más que un mal invento
Una pésima combinación de mucho estrés y aburrimiento
Y si no fuera por ti, habría renunciado a mis sueños
Y si no fuera por ti, iría como un perro sin dueño

Es el sol detrás de tu risa
Que me ciega y me deslumbra
Y tu piel que roza la mía
Pero aún no se acostumbra
Solo tú con media palabra
Me construyes o me derrumbas
Junto a ti me siento mas fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz

Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
No dejas un respiro a mi corazón
Tú me armas, me desarmas

Necesito una razón
Y es difícil creer 
Que no exista una más que este amor

Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Que a pesar de que dicen que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo que pasé junto a ti
Dejó tejido su hilo dentro de mí

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos

Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas

Y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar
Lo que es amar",Antología,1996

Y que estoy aquí queriéndote
Ahogándome
Entre fotos y cuadernos
Entre cosas y recuerdos
Que estoy enloqueciéndome
Cambiándome un pie por la cara mía
Esta noche por el día ay que
Y estoy aquí queriéndote",Estoy Aqui,1996
Shakira Mebarak,"Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Despedazo mi razón
Se destruye algo de mi
Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti

Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Cada vez que sale el sol
Busco en algo el valor
Para continuar así

Y te veo así no te toque
Rezo por ti cada noche
Amanece y pienso en ti
Y retumba en mis oídos
El tictac de los relojes
Y sigo pensando en ti

Y sigo pensando",Pienso en Ti,1996
Shakira Mebarak,"Perteneciste a una raza antigua
De pies descalzos y de sueños blancos
Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando

Tú mordiste la manzana y renunciaste al paraíso
Y condenaste a una serpiente siendo tú el que así lo quiso
Por milenios y milenios permaneciste desnudo
Y te enfrentaste a dinosaurios bajo un techo y sin escudo

Y ahora estas aqui
Queriendo ser feliz
Cuando no te importo
Un pepino tu destino

Perteneciste a una raza antigua
De pies descalzos y de sueños blancos
Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando

Construiste un mundo exacto de acabados tan perfectos
Cada cosa calculada en su espacio y a su tiempo
Yo que soy un caos completo, las entradas, las salidas
Los nombres y las medidas no me caben en los sesos

Y ahora estas aqui
Queriendo ser feliz
Cuando no te importo
Un pepino tu destino

Perteneciste a una raza antigua
De pies descalzos y de sueños blancos
Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es

Saludar al vecino, acostarse a una hora
Trabajar cada día para vivir en la vida
Y contestar solo aquello y sentir solo esto
Y que Dios nos ampare de malos pensamientos

Cumplir con las tareas, asistir al colegio
¿Que diría la familia si eres un fracasado?
Y ponte siempre zapatos, no hagas ruido en la mesa
Usa medias veladas y corbata en las fiestas

Las mujeres se casan siempre antes de treinta
Si no vestirn santos y aunque así no lo quieran
Y en la fiesta de quince es mejor no olvidar
Una fina champaña y bailar bien el vals
Y bailar bien el vals","Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos",1996
Shakira Mebarak,"Hoy es un día de aquellos
En que miro hacia el cielo
Tratando de descifrar el que estés
De vez en cuando lejos
Y de vez en cuando cerca
Unas veces subir
Y otras caer y yo
Cuando tú te me acercas
No respondo de mis actos
Siento que aquí voy
De odiarte a quererte
De principio a fin
Buscando un poco de amor

Buscando un poco de amor

Hay cosas en la vida
En que no encuentras salida
Y ante tus ojos se cierra el telón
Y tapas la boquilla del volcán
Que se hace lava que hace
Mil años está aquí dentro y yo
Tejiendo redecillas para ver si
Puedo atraparte y aquí voy
Colando la macilla en medio de
Este trópico mortal

Cada pensamiento tuyo, cada paso
Que se borren tus lunares y aparezcan en remplazo
Dibujados en tu cuerpo cada beso, cada abrazo

Y ahora que estás aquí
Yo de nuevo soy feliz
Pude entender que eras para mi

Déjame quererte tanto, que te seques con mi llanto
Que se nuble cada cielo y que llueva hasta hacer charcos
Déjame besarte tanto, hasta que quedes sin aliento
Y abrazarte con tal fuerza que te parta hasta los huesos

Y ahora que estás aquí
Yo de nuevo soy feliz
Pude entender que eras para mi

Quiero excederme, perseguirte, pretenderte
Quiero amarte noche y día
Quiero gastarme la vida
Quiero amarrarte a mis 60 de cintura

Shakira Mebarak,"Braulio tiene ojos grandes y cabellos oscuros
Nunca come en exceso y jamás duerme desnudo
Siempre viste de gris, pues no tiene remedio
La tendencia a buscarse siempre el punto intermedio

Dana es niña de bien (eso dicen sus padres)
Nunca llega a su casa a más de diez ni muy tarde
Braulio y Dana se quieren como cualquier pareja
Pero un día fueron presa de la naturaleza
Y de sus propios instintos
No escaparon con suerte
Con el fuego por dentro
Y las hormonas presentes
Por la ley del magneto
Se acercaron los cuerpos

Pero si a la hora del té
Nada pasa
Sólo te irás lejos de casa
Por haber traído un habitante más
A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
Donde lo que no se quiere se mata

Ese día llegaste un poco más de las diez
Pero el susto se dio unas semanas después
Cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
Un niño nacería y ya sabías la fecha

Y antes de que el vecino y la familia supieran
Fuiste donde el doctor a acabar con el problema
Hoy tu vecino esta en casa dándose un buen duchazo
Y tu dos metros bajo tierra viendo crecer gusanos

Pero si a la hora del té
Nada pasa
Sólo te irás lejos de casa
Por haber traído un habitante más
A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
Donde lo que no se quiere se mata

Shakira Mebarak,"Te espero sentada en la esquina de siempre
Y más arreglada que si fuera un viernes
Sin ninguna cita hecha previamente
Pero con la plena intuición de verte

Mis ojos no paran de mirar y mirar
El oscuro pedernal de las ideas
Buscando más huecos dentro de este hueco
Buscando una luz en medio de este cielo

Mi cielo, mi cielo
Pobre de mi cielo

Mis manos las guardo porque tengo frío
Y se sienten raras dentro del bolsillo
Ha pasado ya más de una hora y media
No has aparecido, me falló mi instinto

Pero es que mi instinto
No sabe de amores
Pero es que mi instinto
No sabe que

Que ha aumentado su nivel
Ya la música no tiene el mismo
Efecto que solía tener

Tal vez haya vivido tanto
En tan poco y tan corto tiempo
Que no sé ni que idioma hablo
Ni que velas cargo dentro
De este entierro

Siento que no tengo fuerzas ya
Para saltar y agarrar el sol
Y por más que yo lo intente
No me escucho ni mi propia voz

En un mausoleo de cristal
Seca hasta los huesos por llorar
Y muerta como puede estar Tiberio en su huacal

Toda en ruinas como el Partenón
Sola como terminó Colón
Pálida como una Mona Lisa
Amargada como un limón
Arrugada como acordeón

Como la Esfinge cuando perdió su nariz
Como Alejandro Magno
Sin su espada y sin su dardo
Como un pobre cristiano en pleno Imperio Romano

Busco algo que pueda contestar
Porque estoy cansada de pensar
Cómo es que transcurren los segundos
Y yo sobrevivo a este diluvio universal

Sin más esfuerzo la explicación
Aparece en un viejo cajón
Y en menos de una sola fracción
Vuelve a vivir y se viste de verde el corazón

Como la Esfinge cuando perdió su nariz
Como Alejandro Magno
Sin su espada y sin su dardo
Como un pobre Cristiano en pleno Imperio Romano

Vuelve, vuelve
Vuelve, vuelve

Que mi vida se desliza por un caño
Que mis pies de estar parados tienen callos
Ya no sé cómo decirte que te extraño
Y ya en éstas he pasado más de un año

Vuelve, vuelve

Sometimes I pray for a blackout
When the candles are placed
Nothing more I crave than a blackout
Let there be no light
Let there be no light, ’til the sunrise
Let there be no light
Only then will I open my eyes
Let there be no light

Is there a light of mine
It’s like my peace of mind
Even when I’m in the dark
Still gotta let me shine
Let me fly, my mind’s got wings on it
Gotta play that ground, got pink on it
My little bro’s got a sixth on it
I splash cash and I drink solid
I don’t wanna act bad, don’t wanna see a pap’ flash
I just wanna black out without backlash
Don’t wanna hear snap snap snap, that shit gets annoying
Wanna be alive, not just employed
There, following my heart
Even the light’s got faith in the dark, amen

When the lights hurt my brain

Or that there Serrano flowing, like it’s serving through a drip
I am no longer a person, I’m a star up in the b*tch
So I talk with body language, my vocabulary is sh*t
Got a feeling that you’re feeling how I’m feeling
Would waking up with me tomorrow morning make your evening
If so, let’s find a corner in the place that I can breathe in
My ego’s claustrophobic, you should know we’ve had a threesome
Leave it

Only then will I open my eyes
Let there be no light

Take away my shine
Take away my eyesight

It's the only chance, you can break through
Or the winter will be long

Take good care
Be careful what you do
When the leaves are falling
It could be they cover everything around the tree",Fall,2005

I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

I just can't let it go like that
And oh, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why we come back

The only thing I've ever done that still feels right
Must be sad in my ways
A stubborn kind of fella, he's not everyday

Just keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
(Lovin' me)

I dreamed last night that I lost your love
I felt sad because it seemed so real
I don't climb to bed, I had to call you up
And make sure you notice what I feel

How many times, I took for granted
But you know our love was sound
Stay by my side, let nothing feel when
I put my feet on solid ground

So just keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me

Your brothers got it sussed he takes biology
Your dads not a criminal he's part of the economy
Your mums not invisible she's knows about philosophy

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

You like to have a row it's part of your vocabulary
You talk about love like you're gonna win the lottery
You've got it all planned like daylight robbery
Your friends just say he's such a cheeky monkey

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend

You talk about the stars like a hippy on celery
I'll do the washing up and you can play monopoly
It's such an opportunity for you to start photography
I ain't going there it's out of my geography

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend

He's always getting drunk and I have to carry him
But what's a name she has to take the blame
I only want a laugh but here we go again

Sham 69,"Voices in my head shouting their pain
While everyone around me is taking the blame
I hear their crying, I shed their tears
I've been rolling the dice for so many years

Voices, what do you want of me
Voices, which way do I turn
Voices, nightmares and mind games
Put down on paper for rock and roll puppets to laugh at

Jailers of passion on a one way street
Only mirrored reflections of people I meet
So turn on the noise hit yourself in the face
Well I've got the card to beat your ace

Voices, what do you want of me
Voices, which way do I turn
Voices, nightmares and mind games
Put down on paper for rock and roll puppets to laugh at

Temptations all around me
But I've got no choice
Emotions of an animal
On a tightened lead
Time is a circle on a telephone
I hear it ringing but I'm not at home
Problems are shallow so don't look back
Black and white checkmate
I won so how's that

Voices, which way do I turn

Can you read his mind by the clothes that he wears
Can you see a fat man by the pattern on his tie

Then mister you're a better man than I
Mister you're a better man than I

Could you tell a wise man by the way he speaks or spells
Is this more important than the stories that he tells
And call a man a fool if for wealth he doesn't strive

Then mister you're a better man than I
Mister you're a better man than I

Can you condemn a man if your faith he doesn't hold
Say the colour of his skin is the colour of his soul
Can you say that men for king and country all must die

And give my love to Wormwood Scrubs

Yeah they nicked me 'cause they were able
To see what I'd written on the table
I never rob from the poor

Here's the keys now give us the grand

Fly away from this land
Made of old scraps of sorrow
No way back, free to ride
Hesitation... sacrifice

Mesmerize, hold on tight
For the heavens bend down
There's a tunnel, long and winding
Leading on towards the light

All becomes so real
Making dreams come true
To release your mind and free your soul

Free yourself from misery, let go
Hear my voice and
I will guide your roaming

Oh, free yourself from misery let go
Hear my voice and I will light your road
Leave behind the world you know, and float
Hear my voice and I will guide your roaming

Look around, what do you see
Caugh up in humility?
Too many souls are on their own
Fallen angels moving on

There's more to get, more to find
Feelings of another kind
The chice is set, take it soon
For even you won't be immune now

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Don't keep trusting your own lies

Who's in command of your heart
Of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague
As they soar high and low

Yet someday, still alive
You will find a will to strive
For someone else will come along
To lift you up, to right the wrong

And you will see within your eyes
Figures that comes back to life
You'll touch the wounds that never heal
Love is raw, it's not for real

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Let me hold you for a while

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control

There was a time when the fields were green
The world was one, life was filled with something
There was a blue sea, on the horizon
There was a dream of a lasting fire
We bottomed out, life's become so cruel
Along the way, a regardless torment
Is there a cause that we would die for?
Is there a place where the spirit lives on?

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control
There's more to know and there's much more beyond
The faith that you've lost you will find on your own

Without you will I ever dare to survive?

Shamra,"I see them marching off to war
They're looking so heroic
I'm told they won't be gone for long
But, it's a lie they know it
Ten thousand gone they won't return
Never to be seen again
Strategic games are all we learn
In the end
But, they say
Don't you worry about the situation
(a message from the telephone)
They're out there fighting for the state of the nation
(they're waiting for the chance to come home)
They always have to fight the alienation
(and realize they're fighting alone)
When night's mere memory fades to dust
We'll get back on our feet again
This war has nothing to do with us
But, somehow we're so involved in it
Well, don't you worry about the situation
(a message from the telephone)
They're out there fighting for the state of the nation

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

Shams Tharani,"From hood to hood they see what's hood
And know who I be! uh!

I got the Yankee leaning, just sitting over to browse
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill

[Chorus:]
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be

(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!

I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
With the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the things, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
I know the snakes gonna slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!

[Chorus]

They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! catch up!

Shanachie,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

I feel the force of night
It pulls me home

'Cause it’s too late now
To shake it off somehow
There’s nowhere to turn around
I’m already in too far

You’re a loaded gun
I know I can’t outrun
So if my time has come
Then show me who you are

It’s a dark night
But love will break my fall
And you can have it all
I’m yours right here and now

So breathe in
And bind me to your side
There’s no escape tonight
I’m helpless, take me down

Call my name
Lead me to the flame
I’m crossing through, into you
You’re all I want

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2006
Shane Harper,"Well I don't know what to do here,
I cant get my eyes off of you dear.
Everything you do is amazing and
I'm just saying you're so beautiful in every way.
Girl, could you please just stay?

[Chorus]
I'm just sayin' what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world.
Could you, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on the warmth of this day
When I'm with you you take my breath away.
Walk with me, talk with me, and stay with me
And when they drop the beat,
Dance with me.

I get nervous when I'm talking to you,
But on the dance floor you know I can come through
I know how to lay it down.
Listen to the sound, baby let your body hit the ground.

[Chorus]

Woah oh, dance with me

Well I've danced before with other girls,
But none like this.
I've moved to the rhythm a thousand times,
But not like this.
This is the difference, you're the one I'm missin'
Just give me a try
I'll show you why, yeah

Shane Harper,"I wait for you to give me a sign
You tire me I have uncertainty
About how you feel, how your heart works
I just need to know for sure

If I asked you out would you smile and say yes
If I held your hand would you tell all your friends
If I sang you a song would you ask me to sing it again
Or maybe we should just be friends
Or maybe we should just be friends

There are so many things that I want to know
What do you love what do you hate what makes you strong
What makes you break
What makes you laugh what makes you cry I need to know

They tell you it's not worth the price, so just let it go.

When you're feeling lost, you'll find your way.

The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold.
At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home.
The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know.
But the angels, they brought you, and they're gonna hold you up.
They're gonna hold you up.

They see the fear in your eyes, heart sinks like a stone.
'Cause when you're afraid, it weighs on your soul.

Shane Howard,"If I gave my heart to you
Would you promise to be true
It would break my heart in two
If you left me waiting anticipating

Till some other magic day
I may steal your heart away
Then you would take my hand
And then understand me
When you'd really see me

In a world of different dreams
Where all things aren't what they seem
When you would take my hand

If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart to you

For only truth remains
Cause all things are just the same
The excepting part of truth

If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart to you
",If I Gave My Heart to You,1995
Shane Koyczan,"Used to anticipate the sign of the coming day
And all through winter's decay, you just mark the way
We worry what people'd say if we up and walked away
I swore we had a place to stay
Stay
That's what mothers say when their sons and daughters go away
They say ""stay."" my mother said go
So I wasn't there the night she fell out of her chair so frustrated that she Amputated her own legs, or rather tried to, with a steak knife
Her life leaking out on the white floor blossoming like roses in the snow
Her relationship was an anthem composed of words like ""gotta go."" so we went
And sent our regards on postcards from all the places that we'd been, with stories About all the things we'd seen
That's how it was with you and I
Why say goodbye when we could still write?
And then we took your hands
But we should've practiced our goodbyes because then I took your eyes and I was Somewhere in the middle of nowhere watching the sun rise over a stop sign faced down the center line of a highway filled with sudden turns for the worse
Coming back home cause I gotta play nurse
Gotta figure out with pill alleviates which pain, which part of your brain is being Used for a boxing bag as your body became a never-ending game of freeze tag taking Place in an empty playground
I was left looking for your limbs at a lost and found and I couldn't set you free
So we just sat there, our heads bent towards each other like flowers in the small Hours of the morning while light wandered in like a warning that time is passing and You ride a little home with it bit by bit every day
And all I could say is if I could, I would write you some way out of this but my gift Is useless and you said, no
Write me a poem to make me happy

Over the hill and gone
And I'd never been that far
Some boy along the way taught me to play guitar
And you said that you'd read to me if I fell asleep
Rock me awake again, promise me
But you make such beautiful words
I wrote ""move, pen, move
Write me a bedroom where cures make love to our cancers
But my mother just motions to a bottle full of answers and says, help me go
Now I know something of how a piano must feel when it looks at the fireplace to see Sheet music being used for kindling
Smoke signaling the end of some song that I thought it would take too long to learn
So I just sit here watching you burn away
All those notes that never had a chance to play
To hear the music of what you had to say
But I count out the pills, just to see if I can do it
And I can't even get halfway through it 
Before I turn back into your son and say stay

I need something to lean against
I think that's okay, butterflies, you read to me
They all flew away
And I'm saddened by the thought and sometimes I think too much and though I'm happy Right here, you know that I'm really not
It's distracting
I could hook up to my heart to your ears and let my tears be your morphine drip
And maybe it's easier to let you slip away than it is to say goodbye
So I hold my breath
Because in the countdown to death, the question of why melts into when?
How much time do we have left 
Because if I knew what I know now then move pen move
Write me a mountain because headstones are not big enough
None of this is
Stop it, write me a poem to make me happy
I swear write this, stay, she smiles and says gotta go
I know, goodbye
Over the years it seems that aging's just not for me
Though I ache just below the knees and it flows to my heart 
And all through the hearts I need
It's not how it ought to be
You're falling away from me
And it's just not right
Falling away from me
It's not right
But you make such beautiful words
Now it's trying
Oh, how it's tragic
But you make such beautiful words",Tragic Turn of Events/Move Pen Move,

The book I gave her that she never read

I suppose I should have begged with her to stay

And Oh! Daddy didn't like my hair

Smiling proud and young
Around the hemp, around his neck

Behind him marched in gray array

Held his head up and he did sing

For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet

With a lady proud and fair
So passionate were she and I
We made fire in the air
I loved her more than life itself
She loved me just the same
And it broke my heart
To think we'd part if she ended the affair

But I was brutal, I was ignorant
I was cruel I was brash
I never gave a damn about
The beauty that I smashed
No sadist I, I took delight
In making my Love cry
Now I'd pray for a single kiss from her
To be lashed and crucified

And now I feel this lady fair
Can never more be mine
Long gone are night in my lonely bed
All suffering and crying
And though I fear that through this life
She'll only call me friend
Til I'm dead and buried in my grave
My Love will never end",The Song With No Name,1995

I find it all so amusing.

Oh, no, oh no not me, I did it my way.

Shane MacGowan & the Popes,"Last night as I lay dreaming
My way across the sea
James Mangan brought me comfort
With laudnum and poitin
He flew me back to Dublin
In 1819
To a public execution
Being held on Stephen's Green
The young man on the platform
Held his head up and he did sing
Then he whispered hard into my ear
As he handed me this ring

""If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me!

This snake cannot be captured
This snake cannot be tied
This snake cannot be tortured, or
Hung or crucified

It came down through the ages
It belongs to you and me
So pass it on and pass it on
'Till all mankind is free

If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me""

He swung, his face went purple
A roar came from the crowd
But Mangan laughed and pushed me
And we got back on the cloud
He dropped me off in London
Back in this dying land
But my eyes were filled with wonder
At the ring still in my hand

If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me!

And if you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet

Shane MacGowan & the Popes,"Long years ago I fell in love
With a lady proud and fair
So passionate were she and I
We made fire in the air
I loved her more than life itself
She loved me just the same
And it broke my heart
To think we'd part if she ended the affair

But I was brutal, I was ignorant
I was cruel I was brash
I never gave a damn about
The beauty that I smashed
No sadist I, I took delight
In making my Love cry
Now I'd pray for a single kiss from her
To be lashed and crucified

And now I feel this lady fair
Can never more be mine
Long gone are night in my lonely bed
All suffering and crying
And though I fear that through this life
She'll only call me friend
Til I'm dead and buried in my grave
My Love will never end",The Song With No Name,1995
Shane MacGowan & the Popes,"Down the dirty old streets
The Angel of the East is calling
And with a trembling hand
I open up a can

Before I open up my eyes
I can feel her love inside me
But then I realize
My girl with green eyes
Is no longer there beside me

Vicoria, you left me in opium euphoria
With a fat monk singing Gloria
My girl with green eyes

Only you see that I am lazy
Don't care about fame
Nor money like a child
And I'm just like a child
Who's forgotten how to smile

All the people are so busy
I have nothing to bother about
It seems that I'm different
Seems that I am strange

I'll put my pipe aside and hit the road
However far away I have to go
To find my girl with green eyes

My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Regrets I have a few, but then again, too few to mention,
I did what I had to do, and saw it through' without exception,
I planned each chartered course,
Each careful step along the by-way.
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off more than I could chew,
But through' it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up, and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall, and did it my way.

I've loved, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill,
My share of losing, and now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh no not me, I did it my way.

For what is a man, what has he got,
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels,
And not the words of one who kneels,
The record shows I took the blows, and did it my way",My Way [*],1997

I said my name is Forrest Gump
Then I blew his arm off with my twelve gauge pump

Shane MacGowan & the Popes,"The cadillac stood by the house
And the yanks they were within
And the tinker boys they hissed advice
'Hot-wire her with a pin'
Then we turned and shook as we had a look
In the room where the dead men lay
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip
To the shore where his father's laid

But fifteen minutes later
We had our first taste of whiskey
There was uncles giving lectures
On ancient Irish history
The men all started telling jokes
And the women they got frisky
At five o'clock in the evening

He fought the champ in Pittsburgh
And he slashed him to the ground
He took on Tiny Tartanella
And it only went one round
He never had no time for reds
For drink or dice or whores
And he never threw a fight
Unless the fight was right
So they sent him to the war

Fare the well gone away
There's nothing left to say

When I said goodbye to you
I remember how I swore
That I'd come back to you one day
And as the sunset came to meet
The evening on the hill
I told you I'd always love you

Shane MacGowan's Popes,"The cadillac stood by the house
And the yanks they were within
And the tinker boys they hissed advice
'Hot-wire her with a pin'
Then we turned and shook as we had a look
In the room where the dead men lay
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip
To the shore where his father's laid

But fifteen minutes later
We had our first taste of whiskey
There was uncles giving lectures
On ancient Irish history
The men all started telling jokes
And the women they got frisky
At five o'clock in the evening
Every bastard there was piskey

Fare thee well going away
There's nothing left to say
Farewell to New York City boys
To Boston and PA
He took them out
With a well-aimed clout
He was often heard to say
I'm a free born man of the USA

He fought the champ in Pittsburgh
And he slashed him to the ground
He took on Tiny Tartanella
And it only went one round
He never had no time for reds
For drink or dice or whores
And he never threw a fight
Unless the fight was right
So they sent him to the war

Fare the well gone away
There's nothing left to say
With a slainte Joe and Erin go
My love's in Amerikay
The calling of the rosary
Spanish wine from far away
I'm a free born man of the USA

This morning on the harbour
When I said goodbye to you
I remember how I swore
That I'd come back to you one day
And as the sunset came to meet
The evening on the hill
I told you I'd always love you
I always did and I always will

Fare thee well gone away
There's nothing left to say
'cept to say adieu
To your eyes as blue
As the water in the bay
And to big Jim Dwyer
The man of wire

I'm a free born man of the USA
I'm a free born man of the USA
I'm a free born man of the USA",Body of an American,2002
