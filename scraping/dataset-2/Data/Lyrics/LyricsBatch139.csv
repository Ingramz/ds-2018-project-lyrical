Diam's,"Laisse-moi kiffer la vibe avec mon mec
J'ai pas de temps à perdre dans des prises de tête
Pourquoi tu m'observes? Pourquoi tu me regardes?
Tu veux mon mec ou quoi? Je te mets en garde
On touche pas ça, on baisse les yeux
T'as cru que t'avais du style dans ton peau de pêche bleu?
Mais meuf, j'ai le même, on a toutes le même
Car on va toutes se ruiner chez H&M
Je sais que je ne suis pas une bombe latine
Ni que je suis pas une blonde platine
Je sais que tu ne veux pas que je t’égratigne
Tu galères? Bah viens, je te présente le DJ derrière les platines

Je sais que j'suis pas une bombe latine, ni une blonde platine
DJ!

Je sais que j'suis pas une bombe latine, ni une blonde platine
DJ!

Laisse-moi kiffer la vibes avec mon mec (uh, uh)
Je suis pas d'humeur à ce qu'on me prenne la tête (laisse-moi kiffer)
J'ai mes soucis donc s'il-te-plaît arrête (uh, uh)
Laisse-moi kiffer la vibes avec ceux que j'aime (nan, nan, nan, nan)

Laisse-moi kiffer la vibes avec mon mec (uh, uh)
Je suis pas d'humeur à ce qu'on me prenne la tête (laisse-moi kiffer)
J'ai mes soucis donc s'il-te-plaît arrête (uh, uh)
Laisse-moi kiffer la vibes avec ceux que j'aime (nan, nan, nan, nan)

J'suis pas d'humeur à ce qu'on me saoulen DJ
Y a de la foule donc mets-nous un son de fou
Pourquoi tu fais genre? Je te vois venir
Avec tes belles jambes tu te crois tout permis
Mais baisse les yeux, trouve-toi un autre mec c'est mieux
Laisse tomber le mien sérieux
Rien que tu ris, rien que tu tises
Rien qu'tu te prends pour Alicia Keys
Y a trop de coquines, trop de pâles copies
De stars qui se la pètent entre copines
Trop de minettes qui veulent se faire remarquer
Trop de fillettes qui font les belles à peine débarquées
Moi

Je suis pas d'humeur à ce qu'on me prenne la tête
Non, ni d'humeur à ce qu'on drague mon mec
Tu connais ni mon histoire, ni mes problèmes
Cherche-toi un motard ou un mec open
Fais pas le mannequin
J'imagine déjà la tête que tu dois avoir le matin
Donc reste sage, ne me teste pas
Laisse-moi kiffer la vibe, ne me stresse pas
Tu fais la meuf in, mais nous on le sait
Que t'as pompé ton style sur Beyoncé
Je suis pas une bombe latine
Mais moi le DJ passe mon vinyle sur ses platines

Je sais que j'suis pas une bombe latine, ni une blonde platine

Diam's,"Je m'en fous d'avance qu'on dise Diam's t'es trop perso
C'est pour tous les enfants d'art et de pur berceau
Je te parle à toi qui me comprends
Malgré mes fautes de langue
A toi toujours Open quand y a trop de demande
Vas-y crie le si t'a la haine
Dis-le si c'est la merde en bas de chez toi
Mais de toutes façons ce sera la même
J' te parle à toi qui toujours pas trouvé de but
Qui cherche la fin sans même avoir comprit le début

Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce, fonce.
Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce
Mais surtout reste sûre de toi

J' vis la violence que j' vienne d'Afrique ou de Chypre
J' risque une balayette pour un sac Gucci
J' suis qu'une victime moi qui voulais la paix
J' prends plus le RER sûre de sortir entière
Mais j' suis pas seule
A la télé j'entends mes sœurs qui parlent de leur mal-être
Et de leur peine pendant des heures
Où est le bien vu
Qu'on m'arrache mon portable avec le sourire
Et que lorsqu'on m'agresse
J' suis incapable de courir
J' vis dans la crainte
Que dans mon verre il y ait de la drogue
J'évite les rues la nuit car le viol est à la mode
Sinik m'a dit tu sais ici c'est la merde
Pour t'en sortir il faut une patate d'enfer
Ou un grand frère
J' vis dans la crainte
Ma bombe lacrymaux dans la poche
J' suis parano
Car y a trop de haine quand on m'approche
Y a trop de mecs fonc-dés au crack dès le matin
Il veut sa dose
Donc je suis victime de l'arrachage de sac à main

Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce, fonce.
Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce
Mais surtout reste sûre de toi

J' veux pas t' faire de la peine mais plus t'ouvrir les yeux
J' sais pas si j' vois la trentaine comme un rêve ou comme un vœux
Quand moi j' rêve d'amour, de famille et d'accouchement
Certaines trouvent le courage de porter plainte pour attouchement
Dur à croire comme quand j'ai vu ma sœur en sueur
Un inconnu, un couteau, une fellation dans l'ascenseur
Ça pue la vérité parce que mes yeux en sont témoins
J' suis là, juste là crois pas que je revienne de loin
J' t'ai bousculé je t'ai dis ""pardon""
Tu m'as dis:""vas niquer ta race""
""Mais j' t'ai dis pardon!""
Tu m'as mis un point dans la face
Alors maintenant quand on t'attaque ben t'es docile
Plus rien m'étonne vu que même un boulanger est pédophile
Trois petites garces sur M6 ont dit que les blanches couchaient facile
Hé cousine vas y avoue que tu tapines
C'était juste un puzzle de mots et de pensées
Que cette putain d'ambiance repose en paix

Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce, fonce.
Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce
Mais surtout reste sûre de toi

J' vis la violence j'ai encore peine à y croire
Ma concierge m'a dit:""t'es une pute car tu sors avec un noir""
J' vis la violence au jour le jour en attendant demain
D'ailleurs les keufs ils étaient où pour mon histoire de sac à mains?!
Tu me traites de ""chienne"", de ""tinpe"", de ""salope""
Mais mec pourquoi tu t'énerves j' t'ai juste dis que j'ai pas de clope!
Elle voulait pas, mais tu l'as baisée pendant des heures
Hé tu rigoleras ou pas quand ils vont violer ta sœur?
Et des images j'en ai encore des tonnes
Regarde ta mère elle perd son job car elle veut pas sucer son boss
Bref sur ce j' crois que j' vais m'arrêter là
Mais j'oublie pas que pour un Diam's on pourrait me couper le bras
J'oublie pas que pour un Diam's on pourrait me couper le bras

Mon pote Kenedi m'as dit j'ai eu la chance de vivre dans un pav'
Mais pas assez loin du ghetto

Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce, fonce.
Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place
Fonce
Mais surtout reste sûre de toi

Il faut briser la glace
Il ne faut pas s' voiler la face
Défends ton nom et ta place

Diam's,"Qui veux m'enseigner mon art
Va te renseigner moi j'ai tout vu et entendu
Du haut de mon arbre
Le rap c'est mon art
Tu finiras par remarquer

Je veux pas mentir au peuple, lui dire que pour moi sa soûle.
Mentir aux jeunes en disant qu' c'est cool
Quand ça défouraille, va pas m' faire croire
Que le rap c'est de l'argent content.
Faut croire avec une barre
On ai largement content.
Dans ce milieu, j'aime ceux qui ne mentent à quiconque.
Et toi pourquoi tu parle vas-y ferme la petit ?
J'ai toujours la vibes dernier cri, des larmes dans mes écrit
Mais j'ai le sourire quand tu viens m' dire qu' tu m'apprécies
Je peux pas dire que je rêve de vendre 1000 disques
Moi je rêve de vendre mes disques a 1000 personnes puissance 10
C'est pas une vie des fois je gagne même pas le SMIC
Mes je suis la t'as vue on se bise toi et moi c'est show bizz
Je suis incomprise mais je veux être trop prisé
Y a que toi qui pour as faire en sorte que je puisse tout briser
Viens viens dans mon monde je m'en fous connaître des resta
Moi je veux des mômes et du mouv' des mjc au stade
A ce stade de ma vie je veux juste qu'on me connaisse et qu'on me kiffe
Pas qu'on me teste et qu'on kille

Moi c'est diamant au cas ou tu le saurais pas
T'aime plus le rap et sa te soûle donc tu m'appelle et je répare

Je peux pas t'en vouloir
D'avoir sous estimé mon flair
Faut pas me sous estimé mon frère
Car je veux tout briser ça fait trop long time que j'attends la gloire
Je veux qu'on m'aime à defaut qu'on taille
Je suis pas antisociale parce que j'aime pas la musique de?
Moi je suis ouverte big up au tube
J'en bas les ? d'être rentré dans le mouv'

Moi je veux qu'on dise que je suis de la bombe
Big up a ceux qui on kiffé l'époque de time bombe
Rappelle-toi quand sa kickai sec a Paname
Tu suis l'école ou tu ne kick pas si tu na pas l'âme
Concours de flow de phases de balle de larme
2 bal 2 neg
Solo ou soolar un truc de fou renoi
113 et doudou masta
L'époque ou y avaient peu bizz du rap et basta
Nouveau ancien zoulou caillera
Big up a l'escadrille sniper et Kayliah
Bercer à la soul au rap et a la funk
Rappelle toi l'époque où y avait trop de mec sapé a la punk
Le rap d'antan ou y avait même pas de thème
Crois-moi ça a changer va écouter tandem
Vendredi soir y avait disiz et atk
Ce soir c'est freestyle vas-y préviens tes gars
Tout était dans le style le kiff et l'attitude
A 10ans j'ai pris une grosse gifle avec Rapattitude
Puis a défilé les rappeurs se succède
Qui aurait cru qu'un jour on aurait tous ce succès
Moi on ma pas aidé, j'ai galéré ta pas idée
Big up a la ff psy4 de la rime, kdd
Je fait pas la groupie moi je suis loin de sa
Et des amis dans le bizz ba crois moi j'ai pas besoin de ça
J'ai toujours eu la tête sur les épaules
Big up au ménage a 3, la Cliqua, IV my people
J'étais sauvage j'avais le bic amer
Ma plus grosse référence ça reste les niques ta mère
Concert blindé du feu et des pogos
J'étais op moi je connaissais par cœur les sages po
Toujours à la plage dans le combat d'idéal j'ai différent types
DaaraJ Afro Jazz Rutsneg et La Brigade Saian Supa les psychopathes
Crois moi j'connais l'histoire de ceux qui mon marquer
Le hip hop c'est mon art tu finiras par remarquer
Si tu veux on fait un quiz je te parlerais de factor x kazkamy triptik et lagonz'viv
J'oublie pas Fabe K-reen et China Jimmy Sissoko mafia trece Secteur A
Jalane Wallen la Mafia Underground OTA et leur bande
Tonton David Nuttea Sunky et Tiwonik

Moi je suis qu'une petite nana que a voué ses vers a vous
Faut avouer que je vise le nirvana dans tous les genres
Je manque de temps si seulement je pouvais passer
Ce que je connais pas mais qui vont tous nous déclassé
Aujourd'hui je suis officielle demain je le sera peut être plus
Donc je suis aussi celle qui doit défoncer l'actu

Diam's,"On m'attend au studio
Parait qu'ya un challenge là-bas
Parait qu'ya une petite qui dit 'suzy j'la mange' là-bas!
Bon elle est chiante en plus, ce matin j'suis pas d'humeur
J'vais voir son producteur qui pour m'avoir a joué l'allumeur!
Moi c'est suzy j'rap et déchire, je parle de uzy de rap et de désir
J'fais dans la provoc ouais!
J'suis la futur missy, j'suis une meuf trop top ouais!
Une bombe et même un missile
Donc faut j'crame ma rivale dans le tournois
Faut que j'mette le paquet sinon la victoire elle est pas pour moi
J'avoue c'est l'trou noir, si j'perd c'est la honte
Mais j'suis pas sournoise car j'veux percé la haut!
Tu veux m'cerner j'rap mieux qu'toi et ta bande
Directe quand tu m'écoutes ferme-la cash et abandonne
Donc diam's, diamant, diamant j'vais lui mettre un perfect
Elle a peine lâché une farce que déjà moi j'intercepte, tu redis quoi à ca?
Est ce que tu conteste c'est pas ha hin, qu'on m'est pris dans ce contexte
Moi c'est suzy! Yo! J'vais la rabaissé, l'humilier, des vannes par milliers
J'vais la ciller, j'vais la plier
Affilié a aucun groupe ni lascars ni tribu suzy liée aux défaites que j'distribue! 
Moi c'est suzy j'rap et déchire j'parle de uzi de rap et désir! 

Peu importe qui gagne quoiqu'il arrive
La coupe et pour moi j'fais l'nécessaire pour remporter l'tournoi
Peut importe qui gagne diamant c'est fulgurant
Diamant c'est tête d'affiche
Diamant c'est plus les figurants! 

Qu'est-ce qu'elles ont toutes a s'prouver
Diamant! Parait qu'jsuis rare
Diamant! Parait qu'jsuis dyslexique
Car parait qu'jai du lexique, parait qu'on se deal les ziks
Qu'ya des filles qui se disent septiques!
Elle est tellement pas connu que jsavais même pas quelle existait
Faut pas qu'j'reparte toute nue faut pas qu'j'la laisse resister
Mais bon malgré tous, diamant
J'ai pas d'handicap j'ai le flow qui cerne les demoiselles et que même les bandits capte
Logiquement j'devrais même pas rentré dans le jeu mais c'est plus fort que moi
J'devrais même pas car c'est dangereux imagine quelle me sorte moi
Et puis j'm'en fous des polémiques
Si la fille elle m'pose et m'nique
Moi j'm'en fous du clik moi je pose haut les flic
Bon faut que j'grouille j'vais être en retard elle va croire que je fugue
Même si elle souffre, j'ferais pas d'sentiment, elle verra qui jsuis, diamant!
Je suis la force elle le légume et j'dé-dé-déguste la fille
J'dé-dé-dégomme quand mon flow dé-dé-débutte!

Peu importe qui gagne quoiqu'il arrive
La coupe et pour moi j'fais l'nécessaire pour remporter l'tournoi
Peut importe qui gagne diamant c'est fulgurant

Diamant c'est plus les figurants!

Bienvenue pour le fameux clash entre diams et suzy ca va dechirer alors preparer vos cassettes

Alors c'est toi la rival c'est toi qui face a moi frime
Ta a peine 15 ans tu marche de travers 75a de poitre mais bon
Vas-y rap un peu que j'rigole beaucoup et fort
T'as intérêt d'avoir du cran et d'avoir fait beaucoup d'effort!

Hé tu c'est pas qu'j'suis suzy
J'manie le mic comme le fusil
J'pète les fusible
J'rap a la chaîne en gros j'rap a l'usine
Pour quoi tu l'ouvre avec ta voix rauque
Wesh ta fumé trop de marronks on parle de toi dans les arroks avec ton rap déhwok!

Tais-toi, stop, Vassil montre leur qui met a l'amende qui, hein?

Diamant qui met a l'amande diamant qui pose salement suzy sagement
Moque même si le message manque dans ce passage il diront qu'c'est pas sage,non!
Diamant c'est d'l'abattage non!
Diamant sans le son diamant dans ta sono diamant
Ten-ta-tion diamant tente-a-son tour de cramé sa rivale
Si elle arrive a le faire c'est qu'elle va l'faire avec la poigne que ca va l'faire
Et maintenant vassil tu remet le son normalement
Parce que la petite j'crois pas qu'elle peut suivre, vraiment

Tu m'as fait un vrai coup de crasse
Tu mérite des vrais coups de cross des vrais coups
J'casse ton image car moi suzy je tue partout ou j'passe!
J'aurais ma revanche, jsuis rancunière et acharnée
Dis c'que tu veux j'déchire même si j'suis dure a cerner!

Ouais pépère, ça fait plaisir d'être dehors
Bon bah, viens, les parents ils nous attendent,
Ok, ils sont où là ?
A la maison
Si si
Au fait

Mon frère, il serait tant que tu te calmes,
Pose toi qu'on parle car aujourd'hui les parents craquent !
Regarde ta vie, regarde ce que t'as réussi à faire,
T'es voué à l'échec et t'as fait pleurer ta mère !
A force de jouer avec la rue, t'as perdu tes principes,
T'es plus qu'une cible pour les flics, t'es plus qu'un gosse sans avenir !
J'en ai marre des réunions de famille entassés au parloir,
T'as pas le droit de niquer leur vie, non t'as pas le droit de nous faire ça !

J'ai pas choisi les mois passés sous les barreaux,
Je ne suis pas fier d'accélérer le vieillissement de la daronne ! C'est ça !
L'argent ça va mais je préfère quand ça vient,
J'ai fait tout ça pour qu'on soit bien, pour que le frigo soit plein
Je crois que tu comprends pas, quoi, la rue me braque
Je suis là pour payer le loyer pourtant c'est toi qui a eu le bac
J'ai trébuché mais tout va bien rien de cassé,
Depuis que la vie incarcère mon avenir est un casse-tête !

On a le même sang mais c'est pas pour autant qu'on se ressemble,
Pas pour autant qu'on s'entend
Pas pour autant qu'on avance dans le même sens
Pas pour autant pas pour autant qu'on s'aime pas

On a le même sang mais c'est pas pour autant qu'on se ressemble,
Pas pour autant qu'on s'entend
Pas pour autant qu'on avance dans le même sens
Pas pour autant pas pour autant qu'on s'aime pas

Toi tu ne sais que faire que des allers-retours en zonz,
T'es pas foutu d'être un homme à la maison
T'es juste foutu de nous foutre la honte ;
Tu crois franchement qu'elle est fière de son petit,
Qu'elle est fière de son fils quand elle se confie au psy !
Il serait tant que t'arrêtes ta came, que t'arrêtes un peu ton biz,
Que tu quittes un peu ta cave, sans pour autant viser le SMIC,
Mon frère, tu sais on a peur de te perdre, malgré ton coeur de pierre
Nous on t'aime et on serait fier que tu perces !
Regarde t'es pas capable d'avoir une famille,
T'es incapable d'aimer une femme t'es juste coupable de nous salir !
Mon frère ça fait 3 fois que tu vas en taule,
Moi j'ai le poids de la famille sur les épaules
Car je ne veux pas qu'on finisse pauvre !
T'as rien compris nous on s'en fout de ta tune, on s'en fout de ta rue,
Mais tu me rends fou t'as vu !
Parce que je veux pas nous voir en bas,
Je veux que les rent-pa nous voient en star,
Mon frère moi j'aimerais juste que t'arrêtes d'aller au shtar 

On a le même sang mais c'est pas pour autant qu'on se ressemble,
Pas pour autant qu'on s'entend

Ma soeur, je mène ma vie dangereusement
Entre le luxe et la misère j'ai fait mon choix malheureusement,
C'est dur de remonter la côte défoncé à l'alcool,
Au cas où tu le sais pas les fachos ont des flashballs!
Tu parles de fonder une famille, mais tous les kondés me fatiguent
Ma vie n'est plus très sure c'est le béton qui me l'a dit
Trop de galère les soucis me déboussolent
L'argent que je vous donne est aussi sale que le sous-sol
Mais remballe ta morale à deux balles t'as rien compris,
Le daron sera fier quand la baraque sera construite
Aller arrête 
Des substances, des poèmes, des mauvaises résolutions,
Dans le cerveau plus de problèmes que de solutions !
C'est pas fini, la suite est dramatique,
Quand la situation s'aggrave la tise la dédramatise ;
Il fallait faire ce choix, j'ai préféré
te savoir riche et en colère
Plutôt que pauvre et fier de moi",Le Meme Sang,2005

Y a comme un goût de haine quand je marche dans ma ville
Y a comme un goût de gène quand je parle de ma vie
Y a comme un goût d'aigreur chez les jeunes de l'an 2000
Y a comme un goût d'erreur quand j'vois le taux de suicide
Me demande pas s'qui les pousse à faire sauter beat trine
J'suis pas la mairie j'suis qu'une artiste en de firme
Moi j'suis qu'une boulette
Me demande pas si j'ai le bac jai que le rap
Et je l'embarque que je l'embrase
Je le mate car je l'embrasse
Y a comme un gout d'attentat
Comme un gout de Bertrand Quantat
Comme un gout d'entrax pendant l'entracte
Y a comme un gout de foulette foulette chez les mômes

Y a comme un goût d'alcool dans les locaux de police
Y a comme un goût de peur chez les meufs de l'an 2000
Y a comme un goût de beuh dans l'oxygène que l'on respire

Moi j'suis qu'une boulette
Me demande pas si j'aime la vie

- Mel c'est Vi', ouvre moi!
- Ca va Vi'? T'as l'air bizarre! Qu'est-ce qui y a?
- Non ça va pas non!
- Bah dit moi qu'est-ce qui ya!

Mel assieds-toi faut que j'te parle, j'ai passé ma journée dans le noir
Mel je le sens, je le sais, je le suis, il se fout de moi

Mais Vi' arrête! Tu sais ton mec t'aime
Ton mec m'a dit ""Tu sais Mélanie, Vi' c'est une reine et je pourrai crever pour elle""
Faut pas que tu paniques, j'te jure ton mec assure, ton mec assume, Vi' ouais
Ton mec est pur, il te trompe pas, j'en suis sûre

Non mais tu n'sais pas toi, ça fait deux mois que j'sens son odeur (quoi?)
Qu'elle laisse des messages tous les quarts d'heure (mais non!)
J'ai infiltré son répondeur (mais non!)
Mon mec se tape une autre femme ouais

- Et tu sais quoi d'elle, t'en as la preuve formelle?

Elle s'appelle Andy, fille de la nuit, elle a un mec qui vit sur Saint-Denis
J'ai pas fini : je les ai vus ensemble mardi
Et je suis sûre que là tout de suite il est avec elle
J'ai même l'adresse de l'hôtel

J'étais à côté de la plaque, je croyais que ton mec était intact moi
Pas de trucs bizarres, pas de plans drague, pas de pétasses
Je croyais que ton mec était à part, qu'il parlait mariage et appart'
Prends ton sac, l'adresse de leur rencard et viens on va les voir viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (calme toi Vi' ca va aller)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (vas-y gare toi là)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

Ok reste discrète, donne-moi le cric, la bombe lacrymogène
Vite, donne-moi une clé, donne-moi sa plaque
Que je la raye sa BM, que je la crève sa BM
Que je la saigne comme il te blesse sa BM
Si tu savais comme j'ai la haine là

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (Vi viens sort de la voiture viens!)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (mais si viens)
Tu crois quoi? Que j'veux pas?
(J'ai demandé c'est la chambre 203, mais si on va monter viens!)
J'y arriverai pas (Ok c'est au 2ème étage)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

- Vas-y tape
- Ouais 2 secondes, j'arrive

Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là?
J'te croyais chez ton père mais tu te fous de moi
J'ai toujours été droite et j'vivais pour toi
J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi
Et toi t'oses baiser cette chienne

- Mais calme-toi chérie, calme toi
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe là, qu'est-ce qui se passe bébé? Mais qui c'est elle?

Mais ferme ta gueule toi
Et si tu veux parler s'teuplaît rhabille toi
Franchement t'as pas d'honneur, t'as pas honte de toi?
Prends ton string et casse-toi
Les filles comme toi ne méritent pas plus qu'un petit bout de trottoir
(Mais Mélanie, arrête)
Mais ferme ta gueule toi aussi, regarde-toi t'es en calçif' putain
Tu fais le mesquine mais tu viens de briser mon amie, oh
T'es pas un homme t'es qu'une victime
T'as un problème avec ton slip ou quoi?
Putain vas-y Vitaa, on se casse d'ici viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (arrête de pleurer, s'il te plaît)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (viens ma puce viens)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (rentre dans la voiture viens)

Non mais je rêve Mel
Je l'ai pas vu avec elle et c'était pas sa BM
Non c'était pas cet hôtel

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa
C'était bien son cab', c'était bien lui chambre 203
Vitaa, c'était bien ton gars dans les bras d'une petite pétasse
Garde garde le sang-froid, ce bâtard n'est rien sans toi
Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ
Regarde-moi après les drames que j'ai vécus, j'y croyais plus
Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)
J'ai le numéro de ton gars

Je vais le faire pour toi

Diam's victime de l'an 2000
Tout les moyens sont bon pour trouver l'homme de sa vie",Jeune Demoiselle,2006
Diam's,"Marine,
Tu sais ce soir ça va mal,
J'ai trop de choses sur le coeur
Donc il faudrait que l'on parle,
Marine,
Si je m'adresse à toi ce soir
C'est que t'y es pour quelque chose,
T'as tout fait pour qu'ça foire.
Marine,
Dans le pays de Marianne,
Y'a l'amour,
Y'a la guerre,
Mais aussi le mariage.
Marine,
Pourquoi tu perpétues les traditions ?
Sais tu qu'on s'ra des millions à payer l'addition.
Ma haine est immense,
En ce soir de décembre.
Quand je pense à tous ces gens que tu rassembles.
Tu sais,
Moi j'suis comme toi,
J'veux qu'on m'écoute.
Et tout comme toi,
J'aimerais que les jeunes se serrent les coudes.
Marine,
T'as un prénom si tendre,
Un vrai prénom d'ange,
Mais dis-moi c'qui te prend.
Marine,
On ne sera jamais amies
Parce que ma mère est française
Mais qu'je ne suis pas née ici.
Marine,
Regarde-nous,
On est beau.
On vient des 4 coins du monde
Mais pour toi on est trop.
Ma haine est immense quand je pense à ton père.
Il prône la guerre quand nous voulons la paix.

{Refrain:}
Donc j'emmerde...
J'emmerde...
J'emmerde qui ?
Le Front National !
Moi j'emmerde...
(J'emmerde...), j'emmerde...
(J'emmerde...), j'emmerde qui ?
Le Front National.
Moi j'emmerde...
(J'emmerde...), j'emmerde...
(J'emmerde?), j'emmerde qui ?
Le Front National.

Marine,
Tu es victime des pensées de ton géniteur.
Génération 80 on a retrouvé notre fureur.
Marine,
T'avais l'honneur d'être proche de l'ennemi,
D'installer un climat paisible dans nos vies.
Mais Marine,
T'es forcément intelligente.
T'as pas songé à tous ces gens que t'engraines dans l'urgence,
Marine,
T'es mon aînée et pourtant je ne te respecte pas,
Il m'a fallu faire ce choix.
Marine,
Tu pouvais briser la chaîne,
Prendre la parole et nous rendre nos rêves.
Mais Marine,
T'as fait la même connerie que lui
Penser que le blanc ne se mélange pas à autrui.
Marine,
On ne s'ra jamais copine parce que je suis une métisse
Et que je traîne avec Ali.
Marine,
Plus j'te déteste, mieux je vais.
Et plus je proteste et moins nous payons les frais.

{au Refrain}

Marine,
Tu crois vraiment que t'es dans le vrai ?
Que t'as su saisir ta chance,
Et que ton avenir est tracé.
Marine,
Je ne suis pas de ceux qui prônent la haine,
Plutôt de ceux qui votent et qui espèrent que ça s'arrête.
T'as fais couler ce navire Marine,
J'ai peur du suicide collectif des amoureux en couleur.
Marine,
Pourquoi es-tu si pâle ?
Viens faire un tour chez nous c'est coloré, c'est jovial.
Marine,
J'aimerais tellement que tu m'entendes,
Je veux bien être un exemple quand il s'agit de vous descendre.
Marine,
Tu t'appelles Le Pen,
N'oublie jamais que tu es le problème
D'une jeunesse qui saigne.
Viens, viens,
Allons éteindre la flamme,
Ne sois pas de ces fous qui défendent le Diable.
Marine,
J'ai peur que dans quelques temps tu y arrives
Et que nous devions tous foutre le camps

Laissez-moi voir les mains en l'air
C'est pour les princesses et les princes, les grands curs et les pinces

Trop de jeunes blessés par balle finissent à l'hôpital
Trop de jeunes SDF, trop d'enfants qui mangent mal
Les politiques trouvent ça normal ils s'en foutent ça leur est égal
(Diam's) la précarité pré-domine et les frustrations s'installent

Voir nos frères traîner, obligé que ça nous fasse mal
Nous sommes tous dans la même galère ghetto youth et banlieusards
Y'a pas de différence pour eux t'es un marginal

Et de l'ambition, pas de résignation, gens des ghettos, des banlieues, gens de petite condition, boom
Evite la prison, l'argent sale et les « po po »
T'en sortir doit rester toujours ta principale mission

(Diam's)

Si tu viens du ghetto ghetto, tu tu viens de banlieue,
Tu connais le béton et le bédo et t'as peur que du bon Dieu,
C'est admirable si, po-po
T'es une petite banlieusarde et tu finis par kicker avec Admiral T
J'aime quand c'est rapide je fais ma thérapie de groupe
De Paris aux Antilles une tour ça reste une tour,
Une banlieue ça reste terne, un homme ça reste fier
Et merde mes frères, une femme ça reste une mère,
Donc je hausse la tête je viens de là où ça pète
Moi je viens de là où on rêve, là où on s'aime au lance-roquette,
Moi je suis fière, je veux décrocher le ciel,

N'acceptant pas la défaite sur elle j'ai mis un veto
Une confiance totale dans le plus haut, le micro
Comme arme plutôt que les 9 millimètres et les Magnums

Il y a des femmes dans le ghetto, parfois c'est des bons potos
Elles veulent être des mini-miss qui rêvent d'être reines dans un château
Il y a de l'amour dans les blocs
Y'a du rap derrière les portes, po po
Il y a du ragga dans les caves dans les halls, po-po
Il y a du Admiral, y'a des jeunes qui râlent, la banlieue c'est une spirale
Où il y a tout plein de petites Diam's
Y'a de la rage dans les blocs, po po
Y'a des gosses dans les tops, po po

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (calme toi Vi' ca va aller)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (vas-y gare toi là)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

Ok reste discrète, donne-moi le cric, la bombe lacrymogène
Vite, donne-moi une clé, donne-moi sa plaque
Que je la raye sa BM, que je la crève sa BM
Que je la saigne comme il te blesse sa BM
Si tu savais comme j'ai la haine là

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (Vi viens sort de la voiture viens!)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (mais si viens)
Tu crois quoi? Que j'veux pas?
(J'ai demandé c'est la chambre 203, mais si on va monter viens!)
J'y arriverai pas (Ok c'est au 2ème étage)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

- Vas-y tape
- Ouais 2 secondes, j'arrive

Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là?
J'te croyais chez ton père mais tu te fous de moi
J'ai toujours été droite et j'vivais pour toi
J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi
Et toi t'oses baiser cette chienne

- Mais calme-toi chérie, calme toi
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe là, qu'est-ce qui se passe bébé? Mais qui c'est elle?

Mais ferme ta gueule toi
Et si tu veux parler s'teuplaît rhabille toi
Franchement t'as pas d'honneur, t'as pas honte de toi?
Prends ton string et casse-toi
Les filles comme toi ne méritent pas plus qu'un petit bout de trottoir
(Mais Mélanie, arrête)
Mais ferme ta gueule toi aussi, regarde-toi t'es en calçif' putain
Tu fais le mesquine mais tu viens de briser mon amie, oh
T'es pas un homme t'es qu'une victime
T'as un problème avec ton slip ou quoi?
Putain vas-y Vitaa, on se casse d'ici viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (arrête de pleurer, s'il te plaît)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (viens ma puce viens)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (rentre dans la voiture viens)

Non mais je rêve Mel
Je l'ai pas vu avec elle et c'était pas sa BM
Non c'était pas cet hôtel

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa
C'était bien son cab', c'était bien lui chambre 203
Vitaa, c'était bien ton gars dans les bras d'une petite pétasse
Garde garde le sang-froid, ce bâtard n'est rien sans toi
Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ
Regarde-moi après les drames que j'ai vécus, j'y croyais plus
Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)
J'ai le numéro de ton gars

Je vais le faire pour toi

Diam's,"J’étais venue pour évacuer le stress, me vider la tête sur du boom boom shake
J’étais venue en mode sexy back, plus excitable pour mes sounds system
La soirée est toute kitch, tout string, tout de suite, moi j’veux du Justin
Le DJ n’a pas le tube, ni le mix, ni l’honneur, ni la vibe, ni le Cut Killer
Soirée V.I.P, one streap, les meufs ressemblent toutes à leurs strings
Ouai c’est triste à dire, assise je suis qu’avec ma garette-ci
S’arrête quand le riddim accélère, s’arête pas quand le Dj sait que c’est l’air
Vas-y bouge, mets nous du Taïro, du bon Snoop
Vas-y mouille ton maillot, la foule est tabou

J’en veux (j’en veux), j’en veux, pour mon oseille moi
J’en veux (j’en veux), j’en veux, plein les oreilles

Qui on appelle quand les princesses veulent de l’aide
Qui on appelle quand le DJ fait de la peine

Quand on m’appelle, il est du genre 2h du mat
On me dit qu’il y a un problème dans la boïte
Je demande si c’est une question de watts
Mais la réponse c’est que le DJ n’a pas la gouache
On me dit carrément que c’est une tâche
Que la soirée part en vrille, que le public se fâche
Au moment-même où je parle, merde il se prend une baffe
Et que s’il s’arrête pas, il faudra bientôt qu’il se cache
J’explique que la situation est grave
Car ils ont besoin de quelqu’un de brave
J’leur dis que j’veux être payé en cache
Que j’ai besoin d’oseille, et que je boss pas au black
Après une négociation un peu âpre, je décide enfin de quitter la base
D’enfiler ma cape et d’attacher mon masque

Diam's,"Bonsoir à toutes et à tous,
Bienvenus à notre réunion hebdomadaire des mélancoliques anonymes.
Réservons un accueil particulièrement chaleureux aux nouveaux,
Pour qui ça n'a certainement pas été facile de venir jusqu'à nous.
Nous allons débuter cette réunion par un témoignage.
Qui veut se lancer?

Moi

Toi? Et bien nous t'écoutons

Merci,
Bonsoir je m'appelle Saïd

Bonsoir Saïd

J'ai 27 ans et je suis mélancolique
Je suis de ces artistes qui écrivent leur vie
Comme on laisse une dernière lettre prés d'une boite de prose à vide
Ça a été très difficile pour moi de venir ici
D'accepté ma dépendance à la mélancolie
Le déclic a été de voir ma mère recraché en larme
Tous ce qu'elle a bu de mes bouteilles à la mer
Je m'en veux de la voir si triste
Alors qu'elle n'a jamais été la lame de mes cicatrices
Ni personne de ma famille d'ailleurs
Mais leur tailleur est noir à chaque fois qu'ils écoutent mes disques
J'ai pris le risque de faire de la musique
D'étaler ma vie au public pour soigner un mal de vivre
Je prend conscience de mon égoïsme
Quand je vois comment ils subissent le succès de mes lyrics
Je remplis mes vers de rimes mélancoliques
Et ma voie frise le coma italique sur-rythmique
J'aime la pression qui mousse mes thèmes
Un ivrogne qui s'empègue avec des paques de peines

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Au début je rappais pas pour en vivre
On rappait tous dans un bloc autour d'un poste pour le délire
Je partais en impro, j’enchaînais les mots
J'allumais le mic et ma bouche était un chalumeau
Je taffais mes jeux de mots
Je ne dormais plus
Toutes mes nuits étaient blanches pour que mes feuilles ne le soit plus
Je fesais rire mes potes grâce au petit robert
Mais tout à changé depuis qu'on ma volé le rôle de père
J'ai eu mal au point de vouloir me couper les veines
Fallait me voir poser je t'aime à la haine
Fallait entendre ma mère pleurer toute la nuit
À cause des coutumes qui on poussé mon père à la polygamie
C'est vrai que je suis sorti de l'ombre
Mais le monde est tellement stone que je ne pouvais écrire que ""la colombe""
Plus tu grandit moins tu sourit
Le temps souffle et détruit
Ces châteaux du sable qu'on avait construit
Vous savez aujourd'hui une femme m'a mis en cure
Depuis j'ai moins de degrés dans mon écriture
Je suis moins en état de tristesse
Mais je fais toujours autant péter ce putain de mélancotest

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Merci beaucoup Saïd. Merci pour ce témoignage.
Quelqu'un d'autre peut être veut prendre la parole?

Moi je veux bien

Nous t'écoutons.

Bonsoir je m'appelle Mélanie

Bonsoir Mélanie

J'ai 26 ans et je suis mélancolique aussi
Je suis de ces jeunes filles qui haïssent leur vie
Artiste malgré moi parce que les psy' ont faillit à leurs titre
Depuis toujours le mal de l'encre me démange
L'amour me manque mais me dérange
Alors je chante mes cicatrices",Mélancolique Anonyme,2008
Diam's,"J’étais la tu vois lui à côte de moi
On avait 6 ans 
on jouait comme des enfants au docteur
Au docteur
J’étais la je voyais sur son corps les plaies les marques les bleus
J’en croyais pas mes yeux
Mes yeux
Et lui qui me disait je suis un dur
Tu vois les brûlures la sur mes bras 
Je les sens pas
Je les sens pas
J’étais la j’ai rien dis
Et puis je suis parti de chez lui
Si j’y suis retournée
Plus jamais
Plus jamais
J’étais la comme lui j’avais 15 ans à peine
On était dans la cave chez ses parents
Je l’aimais tant
Faut dire qu’il était beau mais il se piquait mon héros a l'hero
J’étais la quand sa mère est venue me dire
C’est fini, on l’enterre lundi
Lundi
J’ai pleuré bien sur j’ai pleuré
puis j’ai recommencé à traîner dehors
Dehors
J’étais la en octobre 80 après la bombe Copernic
Oui J’étais à la manif
Avec tous mes copains
J’étais la c’est vrai quand n’y comprenais rien
Mais on trouvait sa bien
Sa bien
Oui j’étais la pour aider pour le sida les sans papiers
J’ai chanté
Chanté
Sur que j’étais la pour faire la fête !
Et j’ai levé mon verre a ceux qui n’ont plus rien
Encore un verre on n’y peut rien
J’étais la devant ma télé a 20 heures
J’ai vu le monde s’agité
S’agité
J’étais la juste au retour de la somalie du Bangladesh et du Rwanda
J’étais-la 
J’ai bien vu le sort que le Nord réserve au sud
Qui a compris le mépris !J’étais la pour compter les morts
J’étais la et je n’ai rien fait
Et je n’ai rien fait
J’étais-la pourtant
J’étais la et je n’ai rien fait",J'Etais Là [Live 2007],2008
Diam's,"Regarde le monde d’en haut
Tu verras comme on est rien
Vitaa

Je vois cette enfant
Je vois ses yeux, je vois sa main
Mais je n'vois plus ses parents
La foule s’écarte pour laisser place
A un désordre sanglant
Chaque soir la même scène en 16:9 sur nos écrans
Et puis on change de chaine
Et puis on vit quand même
On s’accoutume avec le temps
Si ceux qui souffrent ont tord
Alors qu’on viennent me dire qui sont les beaux, les haineux
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux?

Séchons les larmes
Faisons l'effort
A l’heure où tout s’éteint
D’autres sombrent et souffrent encore
Baisser les armes, l’amour est plus fort
J’aimerais leur rendre l’espoir
Faisons un effort
Pour voir le monde d’en haut

Je vois le monde
Je vois ses enfants
Et tout ce qu’on nous fait croire a l’écran
Ma gorge se noue
Ses mots me viennent
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux?

Je vois le monde
Je vois ses enfants
Et tout ce qu’on nous fait croire a l’écran
Ma gorge se noue
Ses mots me viennent
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux?

A 5 ans j’ai vu le monde et j’ai pleuré
A 15 ans j’ai gueulé
A 20 ans écœurée, j’ai brandi le drapeau de la paix
Répondu à l’appel, descendu le F et le N
J’ai fait ce que j’ai pu, j’ai montée des projets
Fait ce que j’ai cru bon pour toucher le ciel
Et voir le monde d’en haut
M’apercevoir qu’on a trop les yeux rivés sur nos All Star
Voir le monde d’en haut
Se revoir en couche tard primé par les impôts et l’Etat
Voir le monde d’en haut
Reconnaitre que l’Homme est prêt à tout pour le trône
Voir le monde d’en haut
Et se dire qu’on est rien, viens et si on se serait la main?
Ouais, frère on est rien
Rien qu’un grain de sel, dans un océan de connerie humaine

Séchons les larmes
Faisons les forts
A l’heure où tout s’éteins

Baisser les armes, l’amour est plus fort

Tu veux être grand, tu veut être pro, tu fais les shows, t'a la rage

J'ai vu des potes mourir jeunes, s'faire descendre
La vie est comme le feu elle commence par une braise, fini par d'la cendre
Mon sommeil est en cavale
Ma sœur m'a dit pour qui revienne
Les hommes sont comme le temps, moitié lumière moitié ténèbres
J'suis sincère j'me libère de l'orgueil
Comme dit souvent ma mère, le cœur voit ce qui échappe a l’œil
Ta vie c'est ton scénario c'est ton film
Tes bonnes ou mauvaises actions
La meilleure parole est celle que les actes te confirme
J'ai troublé la loi et l'ordre
C'est au milieu de la boue que l'on trouve l'or
J'suis fort comme l'amour, comme la mort j'suis froid
Brute et compliqué mais
Vaut mieux être craint que faire pitié
J'trinque, j'attend d'la vie à la vôtre

Va pas te brûler les mains si Dieu t'a donné une cuillère
Et si la vérité sortait d'la bouche de mon grand-père
Et si à me battre on a trop voulu me descendre
Regarde-les qui jactent leur mort et tâtent sous leur langue
La sagesse est dans les dictons
La paresse dans le piston
Je ne caresserai que mon fiston car la haine est dans l'air
Le paraître est dans le Vuitton
La noblesse dans le pardon mon frère car la guerre est plus facile qu'à faire la paix
Je les vois faire les méchants
Je les vois qui veulent me mordre
Mais ils oublient que leur naissance est le messager de leur mort
Alors je baisse la tête et puis je laisse passer le mal
Patience est mère de sûreté donc mon cœur est un pare-balles
Le remède contre le sort eh bien, c'est de le supporter, le sort
Car il ne dort jamais celui qui ne pense qu'à se venger
""Sois pas plus assoiffé que le soir""

Diamanda Galás,"Sadly one Sunday
I waited and waited
With flowers in my arms
All the dream has created
I waited 'til dreams,
Like my heart, were all broken
The flowers were all dead
And the words were unspoken
The grief that I know
Was beyond all consoling
The beat of my heart
Was a bell that was tolling

Saddest of Sundays

Then came a Sunday
When you came to find me
They bore me to church
And I left you behind me
My eyes could not see
What I wanted to love me
The earth and the flowers
Are forever above me
The bell tolled for me
And the wind whispered, ""Never!""
But you I have loved
And I'll bless you forever

Diamanda Galás,"I went out to the insane asylum
And I saw my baby out there.
I said, ""Please, come back to me, baby,
What in the world are you doing here?""
Then my old man raised up his head,
Tears were falling down from his eyes,
And these are the things

That my old man said:
""When your love has ceased to be
There is no other place for me.
If you don't hold me in your arms
I'd rather be here from now on.
Some people have it half way there,
Without your love I ain't nowhere.
I can eat and I can sleep,
I can even rest in peace.
Please take me as your slave,
And save me from that earthly grave.""

Then sorrow struck my heart,
Tears began to fall down from my eyes.
The only man that I had ever loved in all my life
Out here, in a place and a condition like this.
And I began thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little girl.
She told me when I couldn't help myself
To get down on my knees and pray.
And I fell down on my knees

And these are the words that I said:
""Save me, save me, save me, babe,
Save me, save me, save me, dear.""

Be brave my daughter, the Lord is waiting there

Both the Bible and the courts agree
That the state's allowed to murder in the chair

In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed
The finest lawyers' fees are paid

The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform
Watch me get my muthafuckin rap on
A top cat that rocks rap

The Asiatic rap fanatic that don't have it
My style's tighter than a virgin locked in traffic

Because you watch gangsta flicks, you write rhymes, don't mean you're hardcore

Bless it, then pass it, like Magic's top 10 assists
It's the cheeba-cheeba, another neighborhood news feature
Who can see the, Giant? Not a known creature
Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives

Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no breaks
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camouflage, and besides, I'm God
Mad hard, like the S.A.T., have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G.
Evidently, you still don't know, because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack, but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch ""Clockers""
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

(""Fat Joe"" - Cut and scratched)
[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted MC's
That claim to be true O.G.'s and war specialists
Forever busting guns on the circus ship
But when the beef comes, get on the ???
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll lick 'em all
Strip naked, bitch niggas will never be respected
Joey Green, bagging doubles up in Bowling Green
For all my team, packing the nine, for soon as this team is rolling clean
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Playing thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
WHAT THE FUCK!

(""Diamond D"" - Cut and scratched)
[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like Dre's and Cracks
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts who want
Take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit for no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving pricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, right at home saying ""Bail me out""
Little small time, fucked up when you called mines
D Squared, one of the greatest of all time

[John Dough]
I remember when I used to hang out late with the crew
But after meetin you boo that hangin shit is through, I'm loyal
Plus, faithful to the end and when you talk about leavin
I'm on bended knee like Boyz II Men
Every now and then I cooks, clean, candlelight
Then if I truly set the scene put on some shit by Al Green
But lately you've been actin like the shit I do is weak and unromantic
And I can't understand it
I'm feelin like a duck, shit out of luck and stuck
What the fuck is this relationship goin downhill or goin up?
Once upon a time it was all about you and
me now it's all about, you me and he
Baby, never will I, love another lady
Cause I loved you more than R. Kelly loved Sadie
Maybe I should leave instead of gettin upset
And on some ""Why Me Baby"" shit like Keith Sweat
I bet, you never loved me from the get, and you woulda been split
if I didn't have loot to hit you off with
Feelin like you shot me down with the shottie
I guess it took a fool to learn that love don't love nobody

[Diamond]
Yo Johnny, me and you get the punani
Don't sweat that, cause true players don't respect that

[Chorus]
[Diamond]
Now my affinity for masculinity
led me to steal virginities on rooftops in the vicinity of Trinity
Now I bounce in an Infiniti
The greeny green, gives me a feeling of serenity
But then it be, keepin me on my toes and it shows
in my demeanor, the hoes get meaner when a nigga's broke
In society's yoke
I get in you're damn broke wearin virgin lamb coats
Splurgin grand notes, I had her jigged out in such (yeah)
In my clutch yo son I got touched somethin awful
I thought I had her locked down
but she got down, with some kid three blocks down
You know I took back the fox now (the fox now)
And on her grill all you see are the knots
Now tell me if you ever been, cause son I never been
See in this game I'm a veteran
You know I wet 'em then, in my heart I won't let 'em in
Sittin on my lap I give 'em gaps like David Letterman
Then set 'em and, send 'em on their way
Laid back in the Beamer, sippin Alize

[Diamond]
Now people used to tell me that if you smoked
You'd lose your hope, and it would stunt your growth
I used to chip in with the other young folks
Back when it came in little brown envelopes
Remember the day my moms found a tre
Bust my ass and at night I heard her pray
Lord don't let my boy succumb to
But it was too late, I already begun to
Hanging with the knuckleheads on my block
Smoking in the lobby looking out for cops
Sipping Private Stock, now my eyes are shifty
Who got me covered on the next $2.50?
Nigga I ain't tripping, I passed out a few whippings
On deep throats in cheap coats who wouldn't chip in
It got me flipping, now everything's serene
Purple clouds and ultraviolet dreams

 ""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)
[Sadat X]
My old moms said that the smoke would harm
I'd be a crackhead or die with a needle in my arm
Tried to playy me out, my father was smoking that good lye at the time
That old grown man brown weed with my aunts in the back
I'm a little nigga now saying ""Why they acting like that?""
Coming out all high and laughy off some Richard Pryor tapes
Before he blew up his face trying to base
I was smoking weed when half the niggas with me now was fronting
When cats was anti-drugs there was weed seed in my rugs
I've been to the brown bags, the clear bags, and even the glass jars
I've been smoking with stars in parties and bars
I done got actresses high, the greatest athletes fucked up
Took some niggas from DC to the spot and they came and cracked a knot
And left the spot real hot, check it out
I get up in the morning, take a pee, and light up that good tree
Old girl often ask me why I always get so high
Because it keep me in touch and keep my shit on the smash
And I ain't down with Rudy G no more cause he done fucked up the hash

 ""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)
[John Doe]
Picture me giving up my early moring marijuana
Reading a books, slef-entitled ""The World According to Scamas?""
Yo herbals make the world calmer
True fact, no drama, old timers still smoke like farmers
I done heard many tales about the chunky black
Guess that's why I prefer the chunky black
Every day I'm reminded bout the dangers of smoking
8 o'clock I'm rolling L's, by 8:03 I be coughing
Rehab spots ain't for herb smokers
That's for extremely stressed stock brokers
Who bought four closers from a crack quoters smoke this
If you're offended by the fumes light an incense
She's not laced with infringements or buddhas
She wouldn't have the gall to fool us, please no intruders
She stays true to her students
Stayed loyal til I tamed her up
Took a trip to the greeny green kid and never gave her up
That's why

At twelve noon  plug me in at D&D  you'll be outta there by one o'clock 
Aiight? Call me back and umm give me confirmation. 

I'm ageless  pageless  only want me for that thing 
Hang up the phone  wants to let it ring 
Wit my gold chain, nothing as the hangin' rope 
Who want to stay in court plus knowin' the fact that I'm smokey 

Bust you in the back and play the low key 
Trustin' in the fact that where I go, nobody knows me 
Maybe then I'll go to where the weather is more suited to my taste 
And you got, uprooted in the first place 

I got the 'Chelle fire, 'cause I get deeper than Mya 
Stay on shorties domes like them beauty parlor dryers 
Want some verbal spit from the semi-auto lip 
Your whole body get hit, then you start dancin' and 

And I'm the, overweight afro-diesiaic 
I only lick two and pass if your trees be black

I'm out wit the old *shit*, got a brand new mattress 
Don't want no girl wit no flat chest 
How 'bout the one wit the ?pack less? 
I tickle you laugh, but I just got the math 
Over on Park Ave, off the concourse on ? 
She took two and, she could do it 
My whole crew got anger's wit them 
Similar to travellin', salesman hittin' things from women

Straight from the Rochelle where the G-O-D's dwell 
I hope you didn't think that we fell 
We drink from the well, and it never runs dry 
So we never gon die 
We multiply wit mathematics, women's call us charismatic 
Smoke the aromatic, too much, guess it's a habit

Here me dog, 'cause a nigga ain't the run of the mill 
Blow up your body at will, like a chick on the pill 
I make it hot to death, swing it from right to left 
'Cause I talk so much shit I can taste it on my breath 
I got the head knock, keep rhyme flows under padlock 
Like comstock, wit more shoes than a Foot Locker 
And it don't stop, Diamond D and Brand Nu 
Baggin more chickens than that nigga Frank Purdue 

No more domestication, on some over-seas shit 
Beat a nigga ass till he says ""please quit"" 
While you home alone marinatin' on cheese sticks 
I'm in the back of the 'Burban wit some Chinese chicks 
Lookin' at a map, one chick on my lap 
Tellin' me how she was born in the year of the rap 
But by the time we reach the house, there's no waitin' in fact 
All you see is ankles (yeah what) from the front to the back

Step outta bounds and wind up, red dotted

Probably see me in the club with some hoes ya like
And you know I put it down when it's foes to fight

Can't fuck wit'cha love if ya toes ain't right
I'm on some bullshit but yo, that's my chosen right
That's cool 'cause all I see is O's in sight
Drop shit that'll lift every nose in sight

Like I'm supposed to do, postin' boo
Make you jump around like the Holy Ghost'll do
Let the words get close to you
I'ma show you how cats sleep just like the most of you
Come on

When it comes to spittin' game, I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short smoke the rest of that

I'm like Triple H flying off the ropes
Bring a smile like some coke, fresh off the boats
I make, you and your boys take off ya coats
And if ya girl talks back, get her off the soaps

I'm like fuck you, see I'ma scratch ya name
On some big wheel shit when I match the game
On the low chillin' with a hatch back in Maine
And I still run with niggas that'll snatch ya frames

Yo pardon me, you ain't catch my name?
It's D-Moody
In the Four Seasons about to make a nudie
Used to see hard times but now I see booty

And quite often be up in the loft
And fat asses, titties that are soft and greened out
So you might hear me coughin', I'll make ya dumbass an off
And I'll be the one to put the nails in ya coffin

When it comes to spittin' game, I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short, smoke the rest of that

You get a smack fuckin' with this aristicrat
I'm the element that turns coke from this to that
You against me, it's like fightin' fist to bat
It's gonna be hard to smoke when your ribs get cracked

Think of that, come on if you think I'm wack
Me beatin yo' ass in a mink and hat
Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin' plush you just sink in the back

And I told you heffers before, never before
Will you see a beatmaker ever this raw?
See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor
Big D always leave the crowd yellin' for more

One of the flyest big niggas you will see
If you can figure that black, you will be
Overcome with a mild case of lunacy
When I drop the LP nigga you will see

I'm real like the Son Of Sam while other are soft like Richie Gun-In-Hand

A tough vet, I'm the roughneck that drops logic
The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform
Watch me get my muthafuckin rap on
A top cat that rocks rap
>From the part of Boogie Down Bronx where the cabs don't stop at
The Asiatic rap fanatic that don't have it
My style's tighter than a virgin locked in traffic
You get ripped like a cardboard
Because you watch gangsta flicks, you write rhymes, don't mean you're hardcore
I'm so devine when I flow and rhyme

Be on some hip-hop shit, cause the music like hypnotic
I can't stop it, oh Lord, so I just drops it
Till the slayings leave abrasions, hot like cajun
Trails be blazin behind this chinky-eyed non-Asian
Female bringin it to ya like e-mail
With advanced techniques off these New York streets

But then it, really wouldn't matter to a nigga
You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin

Leave up to my seed, teach him that he gotta bleed
Don't fall victim to greed

Find it, put it to use, have faith and don't stress shit
Meanwhile I hit the ganja, now watch it kiss my lips
Bless it, then pass it, like Magic's top 10 assists
It's the cheeba-cheeba, another neighborhood news feature
Who can see the, Giant? Not a known creature
Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives
Abuse this, get smuddered is how you'll be discovered
Give me 20 years in here with no dough, I still love it
It's in my heart, when I bled, it was red
Won't stop till I drop dead, or catch some led to my head
Some search for bread, loot, cheese, or whatever
But instead I stay true, smoke trees and get clever

Diamond and the Psychotic Neurotics,"Yo, well it's Friday night, I just cashed my cheque
The weekend's here so my thoughts I collect
It's been a long week, but here comes the weekend
Time for girl seeking, should I hit the Beacon?
Or maybe the Apollo? Or should I just max in?
Take in a movie, hit the boom, relaxin'
Couldn't decide so I just headed home
Pump the Walkman do on the headphone
Subway was packed, I couldn't find a seat
So I stood boppin to a Gangstarr beat
I'm in the last car so the Buddha's in the air
Half an hour's passed, yeah I'm almost here
Got off the train, flagged down a taxi
A four dollar ride but he tried to tax me
Knew I wasn't havin' it, I only gave him four
Got out the car then I slammed the door
In front of my building I saw my ex-girl
She had a knapsack on her back (Hello)
I said ""Hello, what brings you around?
You used to try and diss me so don't say you miss me""
She said she made a mistake when she left me
For a kid whose pockets were hefty
And at the time I didn't have a dime
""So tell me what's on your mind?""
She said she wants me back, things will be fat
I said ""Wait a minute baby, don't start attackin'
Things have changed and I'm not hookin""
But she was still good lookin'

I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
I'm so confused, baby
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
About me and you

Invited her in for a chit-chat
She offered me a Stog' but I said I wasn't with that
We began to conversate, I started to unwind
""Can I take my shoes off if you don't mind?""
Thinkin' of the skins and whether I should hit em
She's makin' it easy, 'cause now she throwin' rhythm
Rubbin' on my legs, lookin' in my eyes
While I was schemin', memorise all the lies
So I just sit back, crack a six pack
Hit the boom and grabbed a handful of Tic Tacs
Now's the time, no need to start fakin'
Let's commence the love makin'
On and on til the next morn
Pumpin' all night like Exxon
Feelings of guilt began to sprout so I stop
And like ""As We Lay"" by Shirley Murdock
I forgot about tomorrow and now I feel shaky
I know I was wrong and it makes me
Think, what would I do if I found
That my main squeeze was the neighborhood skeez

I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
I'm so confused, baby
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
About me and you

I'm up before the honey so I drinks some juice
Try to fight the feeling but it's no use
I thought with the wrong head, nuff said
Can't tell my girl, I know that's dead
When she awoke I tried to play it off and say
""I gotta go but baby come another day""
She said ""What's the rush?""
""My feelings will be crushed, if you keep me on a hush-hush""
What am I to do, I'm caught in a bind
But I gotta make up my mind
I said it was fun and we can do it again
Don't want a commitment but we can be friends
She said okay but I could see she was mad
Lookin' in my eyes, like the sea she was sad
I don't mean to hurt you and lead you on
Rapture of passion, champagne glasses
Reality sets in, so honey, let's indulge
In conversation for the duration
And we can get together at another time (Why?)
'Cause now's too much on my mind

I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
I'm so confused, baby
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
About me and you",Confused,1992
Diamond and the Psychotic Neurotics,"Aww yeah, back to basics
Kicking shit in Asics, it's like this

It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)

Day one

I wake up to the sun in the morning at the Justice hour
Refinement is in order so I bust this shower
Get dressed, but first my mind gets blessed
Not words, but best cess compressed in a Phillie
Silly of me, to think that I
Could ever have a morning where the phone didn't ring
I answer, a sweet young thing wants a romancer
I didn't really fancy her, so Build Equality
I get a beep downstairs from Y.Z.O
Knowledge in his head, beats pump the red Geo
Tracker, and in it, we get much blacker
Ride around town running down crackers
Last Sunday of the month so to Harlem we went
Not clubbing, the Parliaments of Harriet Tubman
Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the seeds, peace to the birth
Of the nation of the Five Percent
That sent intelligent brothers to represent
We left the rally now we're maxing uptown
8th Ave, 25th, 45th, and the Polo Grounds
And when it's time to refuel
Lord Jamar jump in the car and say ""Back to the Rule""
It's like that y'all, you know it's as sharp as a knife
It's just a day in the life, it's just a day in the life

It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)

Day two, yo check this out

Every morning when I wake up, phone calls seem to take up
My time, but I don't mind because it's fine
I don't get heated even though I can't sleep
Jump in the shower, then I brush the teeth
Hit the stereo in an instant
Then I twist up a bud, light an incense
Call up a honey if I'm not feeling sunny
Or call up my boys when I want to make noise
The brother Lord Jamar, the brother Derek X
Ahem, oh I forgot, I meant Sadat
X and I flex when I'm writing a rhyme
I got thousands in the bank but I never did a crime
Afternoons I go shopping, but I don't lift
Back in '84 I used to wear K-Swiss
Catch me in Yonkers at the mall buying gear
Take in a movie and sit in the rear
I might be in the studio hard at work
Making hype tracks that sell by the stacks
When it gets dark, I chill with my cutie
We almost broke up 'cause she started acting snooty
When I'm with the fellas, we hit the clubs
The Building, Red Zone, always see a head flown
But I walk away from the bullshit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit

It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)

Day three

I wake up at the 8-ish hour then I take a shower
See a tip from last night still left in the tray
Some stick of boom music cause I found a fat L
Nine times out of ten I used to start this way
Then I study jewels and gems instead of Christianity hymns
Then walk past him to see my man Marco Polo who works in sports stuff
Your two shirts that's tough, a baldie that's rough
Call up the Gods, slide to three main places
We know a lot of faces so the romp game can work
Do you think that I'm a jerk because on my face there's a smirk?
Used to party to party rock from body to body
But my nightly smokes are spent on the cool down low
Rolling up dough and doing mad shows
Not dealing with hoes cause AIDS is a bitch
In the nighttime I get rich because kids pump the tape
Uptown Bronx from the porch to the fire escape, and you don't stop
So to my prehistoric days and dinosaur phase
I was completely energized using Islamic rays
I'm the royal highness, so clear your sinus
Put your trust in the plus and conceal the minus
Your head's unraveling, my force is of a javelin
Your tongue is in a knot and you're babbling on
To the pretense that is the God human?
Come from the darkness to where I'm looming
The hardest working man ever, sea or land
I got the power to devour what MC's withstand",A Day in the Life,1992

Feel the vibe everybody gather round 
I pull the plug still my sound's profound 
I had to take hip hop back to the essence 
Try to go commercial gotta learn a lesson 

You gotta get your fingers dusty (word) 
And keep your ear to the street so you won't get rusty 
Concentrate on the funk vibe (Funk vibe) 
Learn your roots put on your Timberland boots 

I'm true to my art, I never fake a move 
I keep your head bobbing to the psychotic groove 
The vibe is erotic, contagious, and sporotic 
I love beats so much I'm damn near neurotic 

I shoot the gift like a Mack 10 
And sample beats we used to cut way back when
But now the game has changed 
Artist selling out just to make a name 

The underground hip-hop fans can't stand it

Back to a brother who sold out (Did he?) 
He aimed for a name and some fame without any doubt 
He was my man so he let me hear a taste 
But he dissed his face because the shit ain't have no bass 

His beats was clogged, he needed Liquid Plumber 
Damn I wonder why he sound like Donna Summers? 
Or Nat King Cole, that style is old 
100 G's up front you've just been sold 

They kidnap your creative control 
No chance of going platinum or even gold 
It wouldn't happen to me (Why not?)

Had a record deal but the deal wasn't real 
'Cause the record label wouldn't spend any loot 
But he had a deal and my man got souped 

He knew a lot of old beats but it didn't matter 
The label had other ideas for the platter 
I heard the song and I had to scream 
The had him rhyming over hype drum machines 

He didn't like it but he had no say 
And now he's out of here today 
Try to fake the funk, it couldn't shake a rump 
But the radio played the junk anyway 

But the song wouldn't budge 
Now against the ex-label he holds a grudge 
Looking for a deal because the song took a dive 
'Cause he couldn't feel the vibe 

But who's to blame in the world of the rap game 
Stick to your roots like a troop and let me know

Diamond and the Psychotic Neurotics,"Yeah, yeah
Ayo this is going out to all the brothers
Who got like 6 or 7 different addresses, know what I'm saying?
Ayo check this out

My name is John Doe and I'm wanted for murder
I didn't mean to do it but my temperatures blew it
Remember it well, seems like the other day
Now I gotta stay away from around the way
Me and my girl went to the movies
Madly in love, we got shot by Cupid
We both had fat jewels on
So I brought my joint in case brothers act stupid
Got to the movie but before we got in
A kid got robbed by a crew of 10
Punched him and stomped him, nobody would help
Didn't want any beef, so I stayed to self
I got inside, now my girl is shaken
She didn't want to get her jewlery taken
I said ""It's dark in the movie, hey they won't find us""
Then they walked in and sat right behind us
Talking all loud, told all the good parts
Praying to myself ""Please I hope they don't start""
Then I heard mumbling, the words I couldn't figure
(Ayo when the movie's finished we gonna get this nigga)
I kept my cool 'cause I'm only one deep
One against 10, that's a hellified beef
Now the mumblings getting louder
I hear the scheme but to me it's a dream
Maybe I'm wrong, you know the rules
So I kept my cool until they made a move
Somebody reached over and snatched her chain
Punched me in the grill but I felt no pain
They tried to step, but I just couldn't let 'em
So I backed up and I wet 'em, (yeah) now I'm

My name is John Doe and I sling white rock
But not on the corner, I work in a spot
I used to work for a fast food joint
Busting my chops, and still I had to hop
On the train 'cause my change was so small
But now I got a Benz with whitewalls
I open up the spot every morning
And keep things in check for my boss
One day I saw him torture a worker with a hypodermic needle
For a 10 dollar loss
But I got plans of my own
I don't wanna be another man's flunkie
I know the ins and outs of the drug game
Ayo I'm gonna make some dough off these junkies
I told my boss about my plan
And said I want to be my own man
Ayo I know you put me on, but yo I gotta quit
I want my own shit
The scenerio became a tear jerker
He even said I was his best worker
But I continued, and he refused to listen
Became upset because I had ambition
Said he doesn't want me to leave
And I'd better think it over if I still wanna breathe
Doesn't that sound like a threat?
Ayo you wanna play that way? No sweat
He left the spot and said he'll be back
Fuck that, time to react
I looked across the room at the product
It was about 50,000 dollars worth
Well if the chips fall down, I'll just have to handle it
Yeah so I'm stepping with the work, but now I

My name is John Doe and I had to move
I got into a beef now my friend is deceased
I went to see my aunt who lives uptown
Niggas are clocking, no I don't live around the block
But I'm by myself so I'm chillin
Totally aware that they might start illin
I walked in the lobby, they were smoking Phillies
And making loud racket (Ayo kid, run that jacket)
I tried to react but I caught one
Yo you want beef, now you bought one
I barely escaped and said ""I'll be back""
Running home thinking of a counterattack
I told my man, and we all got hyped
(Ayo we gonna do something about this shit tonight)
So everybody jumped in the MPV
Drove to the spot with the shotgun cocked
We got to the building, they was standing outside
They saw my face and began to race
From the spot, but someone shot through the window
I emptied my clip but my man got hit
So much blood that I just couldn't take it
Saying to myself ""Money ain't gonna make it""
Now I feel guilty 'cause it was my beef
The neighborhood knows some friends don't speak
His older brothers keep looking at me
Totally upset and they keep making threats
Word is out that they want my head
Said it's my fault that their little brother's dead

And stay outta town 'til things die down

Diamond and the Psychotic Neurotics,"When you got producers, umm, right now
Rappin and puttin out albums
Y'know, diamond was probably one of the first ever
To be a producer/dj
And, I don't even think he took rappin serious
He just woke up one day and was like ""yo I'ma rap""
And he made a classic
""Psychotic neurotic"" was a classic, album

I sweep the creeps who try to beef and keep
But I don't sweat it 'cause I go fat vocals
You couldn't see me with a pair of bifocals
I got the soul of Nat King Cole
If I go gold, I won't front the role
And go commercial, no not me
Never will I worry ""'Cause it's easy to D""
Feet are on the ground so I can't lose my edge
I did my homework, I didn't jump off a ledge
And now I'm here, and no one can stop me
I clock Gs 'cause my raps ain't sloppy
Who would've thought that I pulled it off
Just like a bandit and brothers can't stand it
How the hell did Diamond D get a deal?
My rhymes are dope, and all my beats appeal
(To who?) To the vast majority
Yeah I kick the flavor, I had to get a waiver
To go to college, back in '88

'Cause I got a bag of tricks like Felix the Cat
You heard the rumor, now you know it's true
So go and tell your buddy that I'm not a fuddy duddy
And if you think that I can't get busy
Then you can step to me, word up

I'm not the one that'll sing the same song

""Best Kept Secret"" is the title that fits me
Yeah, I'll steal a show with the quickness
And get hot like grandpa's quick grits

Up for the funk, the gut of hip-hop

Ayo I get dough just like Merv Griffin

Huh, jealousy's a motherfucker
I jam like Smucker's so don't play me like a sucker
'Cause I can flow with the best of them
A lotta brothers twist their lips but I suggest to them
Don't sleep cause I'm not the one to fuck with
Don't even flinch 'cause I'll leave you stuck with
The knowledge that you're inferior
Yeah, my records even sell in Nigeria
Diggin' in the crates like a maniac
And when my song comes on, it's the same reaction
Everyone moves their head

I only call back the girls with big big breasteses
Ooh, I got bitties, in all the major cities
The safest way to have sex is right between her (tittes)

She started actin' silly, so I popped her like a Willie

The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform

You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin

Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives
Abuse this, get smuddered is how you'll be discovered
Give me 20 years in here with no dough, I still love it
It's in my heart, when I bled, it was red
Won't stop till I drop dead, or catch some led to my head

On the block all alone and put the glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me

A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky

In my clutch yo son I got touched somethin awful
I thought I had her locked down

You know I took back the fox now (the fox now)
And on her grill all you see are the knots

You'd lose your hope, and it would stunt your growth

Remember the day my moms found a tre
Bust my ass and at night I heard her pray
Lord don't let my boy succumb to
But it was too late, I already begun to
Hanging with the knuckleheads on my block
Smoking in the lobby looking out for cops
Sipping Private Stock, now my eyes are shifty

That old grown man brown weed with my aunts in the back
I'm a little nigga now saying ""Why they acting like that?""
Coming out all high and laughy off some Richard Pryor tapes
Before he blew up his face trying to base
I was smoking weed when half the niggas with me now was fronting
When cats was anti-drugs there was weed seed in my rugs
I've been to the brown bags, the clear bags, and even the glass jars
I've been smoking with stars in parties and bars
I done got actresses high, the greatest athletes fucked up
Took some niggas from DC to the spot and they came and cracked a knot
And left the spot real hot, check it out
I get up in the morning, take a pee, and light up that good tree
Old girl often ask me why I always get so high
Because it keep me in touch and keep my shit on the smash
And I ain't down with Rudy G no more cause he done fucked up the hash

Guess that's why I prefer the chunky black
Every day I'm reminded bout the dangers of smoking
8 o'clock I'm rolling L's, by 8:03 I be coughing
Rehab spots ain't for herb smokers
That's for extremely stressed stock brokers
Who bought four closers from a crack quoters smoke this
If you're offended by the fumes light an incense
She's not laced with infringements or buddhas
She wouldn't have the gall to fool us, please no intruders
She stays true to her students
Stayed loyal til I tamed her up
Took a trip to the greeny green kid and never gave her up

Ya see I skip to my loo like Napolean at Waterloo
My name is Diamond D, tell ya what I'm gonna do
I dip and I dab like a Mike Tyson jab
Even though there's flab I possess the gift of gab
I shoot it like a jammy-in
Girls, get the panty-ins
Even wit a fanny and I might win a Grammy-in
Maybe I won't so I'll chill like the pope
See I'll neva mope 'cause ya know my shit is dope
Like Columbian fish scale, ask my man Ishmael
(Diamond D got props like a cop) aaahhhh
Or betta yet DT 'cause brothas can't see me
Even ya girl says ya got a small wee wee
Now ya want to go upside her head (What you talkin bout!!!)
Then you feel intimidated by the things she said (Yo chill!!)
Don't worry bout it 'cause I paid her back, (you know I)
Took her to the rest then I laid her back
I go on and on like popcorn
Wit da butter, aiiiyaayyaayyayo
I used to stutter
But I fall on track-in, some may say I'm wack-in
Fact, but in fact, I'm not any of that black
See I'm the best kept secret

Wit so much flava, niggaz want to sip it
But that's cool 'cause they know I got skills
Let me demonstrate I you will, ahem
Rock is my man and
So is Dapper Dan and
I'll shake a hand and
Don't try ta flam
Or front like a stunt who wants the cunt
I only hit grand slams, neva will I bunt
Bases are loaded, bottom of the ninth
I step to the plate 'cause I know my shit is great
I can't walk down a street
(Aiiyo Diamond, can you make me a beat)
Ya gotta have cheese
About a couple o' g's, huh
But if I know ya, I might just throw ya
A li'l somethin on the side troop
A funky bass line and a hype loop
I got a thousand old records in my crib
I used to hustle but I neva did a bid
Some people call me Jo Jo
I keep a low pro
Non-stop props, so act like you know bro
Pass me a mic and I'mma keep it
Yeah boy, I'm the best kept secret

In other words I'm official
I neva go out like a wet piece of tissue
Ruff and rugged
Stronger than Bounty
New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learn from the best so the rest just fest
Now I'm gettin booked at the Philmore West
Or either in the village so kill it skillet
Ya ask ya'self
Will it eva cease?
'Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll neva use grease
On my dreads but instead if you want some kicks
Step to the mic I'm an 8 to 1 pick
You reap what you sow and I can reap it

[Lord Jamar] 
Aw yeah back to basics kicking shit in Asics it's like this 

It's just a day in the life (of three black men) (Repeat 3x) 
Day one... 

I wake up to the sun in the morning after justice hour 
Refinement is in order so I bust this shower 
Get dressed but first my mind gets blessed 
Not words but best cess compressed in a philly 
Silly of me to think that I 
Could ever have a morning where the phone didn't ring, I am sir 
A sweet young thing, once a romancer 
I didn't really fancy her, so build equality 
I get a beep downstairs from Y.Z.O. 
Knowledge in his head, beats pump the red Geo 
Tracker, and in it, we get much blacker 
Ride around town running down crackers 
Last Sunday of the month so to Harlem we went 
Not clubbing, the parliaments of Harriet Tubman 
Peace to the Gods, peace to the earths 
Peace to the seeds, peace to the birth 
Of the nation of the 5% 
That's it, I tell the gent brothers to represent 
We left the rally now we're maxing uptown 
8th Ave, 25th, 45th, and the Polo Grounds 
And when it's time to refuel 
Lord Jamar jump in the car, say ""Back to the Rule"" 
It's like that y'all, you know it's as sharp as a knife 
It's just a day in the life, it's just a day in the life 

[Diamond] 
It's just a day in the life (of three black men) (Repeat 3x) 
Day two, yo check this out 

Every day when I wake up, phone calls seem to take up 
My time, but I don't mind because it's fine 
I don't get heated even though I can't sleep 
Jump in the shower, then I brush the teeth 
Hit the stereo in an instant 
Then I twist up a bud, light an insync 
Call up a honey if I'm not feeling sunny 
Or call up my boys when I want to make noise 
The brother Lord Jamar, the brother Derek X 
Ahem, oh I forgot, I meant ""Sadat"" 
X and I flex when I'm writing a rhyme 
I got thousands in the bank but I never did a crime 
Afternoons I go shopping, but I don't lift 
Back in '84 I used to wear K-Swiss 
Catch me in Yonkers in the mall buying gear 
Take in a movie and sit in the rear 
I might be in the studio hard at work 
Making hype tracks that sell by the stacks 
When it gets dark, I chill with my cutie 
We almost broke up because she started acting snooty 
When I'm with the fellas, I hit the clubs 
The building, Red Zone, always see a head flown 
But I walk away from the bullshit 
And you don't stop, and you don't quit 

[Sadat X] 
It's just a day in the life (of three black men) (Repeat 3x) 
Day three... 

I wake up after 8, a shower, then I take a shower 
See a tip from last night still left in the tray 
Some stick of boom music cause I found a fat L 
Nine times out of ten I used to start this way 
Then I study jewels and gems instead of Christianity hymns 
Then walk past him to see my man Marco Polo who works in sports stuff 
Your two shirts that's tough, a baldie that's rough 
Call up the Gods, slide to three main places 
We know a lot of faces so the romp game came work 
Do you think that I'm a jerk because on my face there's a smirk? 
Used to party to party rock from body to body 
But my nightly smokes are spent on the cool down low 
Rolling up dough and doing mad shows 
Not dealing with hoes because AIDS is a bitch 
In the nightime I get rich because kids pump the tape 
Uptown Bronx from the porch to the fire escape, and you don't stop 
So to my prehistoric days and dinosaur phase 
I was completely energized using Islamic rays 
I'm the royal highness, so clear your sinus 
Put your trust in the plus and conceal the minus 
Your head's unravelling, my force is of a javelin 
Your tongue is in a knot and you're babbling on 
To the pre test is the God human?

Yo what happened to you, lookin' ill daddy
Used to eat steaks now it's cornmeal daddy
I don't hold my tongue is how I feel daddy
You look a little baddy your fun's alone
I watch flicks, stretched out in a bungalow
And you found out you hon's a hoe
Livin' of a SS sidechecks cause you son's a slow

Got you hand-out like you was born to borrow
Starin' at the diamonds on the arrow

Feds want to know how he gets the cash
In the club, surrounded by tits and ass
And some wild kids that gon' kick some ass
And you broke kids make me laugh
When I see you in the street you gon' have to break me half
I don't want to hear about, yo I'm short today
Or who you had to bail out of court today
Cause there's a thin line between love and dough
I always put business above a hoe

And you keep messin' up packages cause you love to blow

Born of Sorrow my cunning revives me,

The proof's in the pickin'

In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat
Conley was the master, the undisputed king
He'd ruled the town for thirty years
With an army of six strings

[Chorus]

Sometimes after midnight Billy drives through New Orleans
Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room
Opened his case and started a tune
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered ""Go son, go""

[Chorus]

Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound
And he handed Bill his old arch-top and stepped into the crowd
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad
Then he made it talk and in came the band
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned.

I don't know why it's over but it is

But you're gonna have to learn it
It's a long cold swim up against the current
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to turn it around

Than a promise undone

And step by step 
And mile by mile
Taking each turn together
Following the signs 
That point to forever
And side by side
True and tenderhearted
We'll finish what we started

The road we have traveled 
Has sometimes been steep
And we've crossed troubled waters 
That were raging and deep
But with memories to lean on 
And love as our guide
There's no path too winding, 
No river too wide
One foot in front 
Of the other each day
Keeping a promise 
That two young lovers made

[Chorus]",Finish What We Started,1994
Diamond Rio,"Your love just came to visit
Your memory came to stay
It's a shame that being gone
Don't mean you went away
For me it won't be over
'Til the day I find
That one of us has gone out of my mind 

I'll give up on loving you
Or else I'll go insane
It really makes no difference
As long as there's no pain
I know it's just a matter
Of misery and time
'Til one of us has gone out of my mind 

Either I'll forget or I'll go crazy
One way or another
I'm gonna leave you behind
I know that I'll be tortured
By your memory

Diamond Rio,"His eyes are greener than the meadows
His hair is greyer than a ghost
His lungs are blacker than the shadows

Electric halos light their way
Five days of widows mourning
But Friday rolls the stone away

Kentucky mine, doing time
Never see the light of day
Kentucky mine, stand in line
Just to dig your own grave

From coal dust they make a living
To coal dust they will return
The earth is good but unforgiving
And someone's got to keep the fire burnin'

Do not follow where my footsteps lead""

Just rolls right off my tongue

It leaves you all undone.

Over some little thing I've said
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart?
Even when I lose my head

[Chorus]
We've still got it no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits.

Hey, just look at how far we've come 
By choosing to stay;
Baby, don't go there, 
Love don't get nowhere walkin' away
Sometimes the whisper of love 
Gets lost in the angry shout
Even hearts that are in this deep 
Might think about an easy way out
One honest touch makes those worries 
Just fade like stars at dawn
These occasional moments of weakness
Only makes our love more strong

Steaming up his old heap
Two lovers stare up at the stars

This is way too serious

A quarter-acre and a little white house

Might be gettin' steep

Diamond Rio,"Momma died young giving birth to a son
In a home for wayward girls
Daddy was sidewalk, soapbox preacher
Looking forward to the end of the world
Every Friday night he'd pick a Jesus fight
Down at the local pool hall
Racking up souls condemning all those
Caught behind the eight ball
He said I preach for the light

With a slightly tarnished heart of gold
She wasn't half bad for a new step momma
As far as step momma's go
Daddy knew she was the one 
As he baked in the sun
In a parking lot preaching the truth
Up shot her hand and she cried, oh, man
I feel it, yes, I feel it I do
It's been revealed to me down deep in my soul
There were two shooters on the grassy knoll
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head
Let us sing

It's all interpretation
To find the truth 
You gotta read between the lines
Work out your own salvation
That narrow path is hard to define
Heaven's more than a place
It's a state of mind

In his quest for truth
Daddy was moved by the spirit
To take up a snake
In a moment of doubt the venom turned out
Stronger than daddy's faith
But I'll never forget his dying breath
The last words that he said
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy

Is there something else you need

Diamond Rio,"He hung the moon
Raised the sun
Made the lions walk
And the rivers run
Then he sat down, looked around
And thought a bit
Said, ""it's all good but that ain't quite it""
So with his mighty hand he created man
And then

[Chorus]
He had a better idea
A much better idea
He made an angel like sweet perfume
A heavenly smile, someone who
Can light up a room with a heart so true
I thank God he created me
But when I look at you I see
He had a better idea

Thought I'd have to face
This world alone
Just walk through life
Without a hand to hold
And I accepted that
I said in fact it might be nice
To live my way
Now that's paradise
Be he knew all along
I was wrong

Going through the motions
I bet she tried to warn me 
And I didn't even notice

Folded with a key on top
Sitting on the dresser
I opened it
It simply read

How much she really means to me 
And how much I'm regretting

And all that I am left with
Is how I let her go

Saying you'll find me

Where on earth you were
It was getting late, I was getting tired 
And growing more concerned

Where I asked you to marry me
And there you were alone

I knew I would find you
And how it warmed my heart
To see you right there 
Waiting for me with open arms
Said I don't know where I'm going, 
But I can't go on like this

Is something I just can't live with
It's a conflict of emotion
To my heart I must be true

Diamond Stone,"My life and I 
Surely I can testify
When life gets you down
You need a true friend around

Whenever I need you you're always there
You near here to listen show me love and give me wisdom
Someone who understands me and cares about my feelings
Girl I love you so and I want you to know

Let's make a vow that we'll keep this together
You are my sister no matter the color
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My sister, my sister you can always count on me

When I seem tossed and drilled
You uplifted me with worship given
Dragged through some things
And I'll forever be your sister in return

I'm here for you and you're here for me
That's how a friendship supposed to be
Come day or night storm some rain or shine
We'll stay side by side for the rest of my life

Let's make a vow that we'll keep this together
You are my sister no matter the color
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My sister, my sister you can always count on me

With each other we can win
We will always be best friends
And it's you that I can rely all to let me know
With you by my side and Him as our guide
You don't have to worry nah,

Diamondback Texas,"On a rainy, windy morning that's the day that I was born on
In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just thought I'd mention, my Grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning, living and a churning
Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay

I've been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wudn't born no yestday
Got a good Christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Caroline, I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car

Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

In Spain I met Maria; full of fire
What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile

She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!

I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Diana DeGarmo,"Within these empty walls, 
I've been talking to myself again 
You don't hear a word 
Why bother to explain it when 
You say that I should try 
But I feel that I'm half alive 
And the rest of me is somewhere else 

I wish the world would just spin faster 
Get to my happy ever after. 
You're looking at me, 
You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference, 
The difference in me. 

I don't wanta fight 
Don't care whose right or wrong anymore. 
I'm sick of all this pain 
Can it be the way it was before 
When I always made you smile 
Seems it's been a while 
Cause now you're always out of reach 

I wish the world would just spin faster 
Get to my happy ever after. 
You're looking at me, 
You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
(L: the difference, R: the difference in me) 

You say that I should try 
But I feel that I'm half alive 
And the best of me is somewhere else

You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference,

I changed my hair 
And I doing my clothes 
And you say that you see but you don't notice the difference, 
The difference, the difference in me. 
I am the same as I was before. 
I'm not afraid to walk right out that door.

Diana DeGarmo,"Do me a favor 
And tell me what you think about me 
Tell me how you want this to be 
Go out on a limb and just dream 

Paint a picture 
Choose your colors extra wise 
Especially what you put on my mind 
Fill me in so I can fly high tonight 

Woahooo your thoughts are gonna lift me up 
Do you know its good to want too much 

[Chorus]
Oh you've got my head in the clouds 
And oh you've got me comin' around 
The more you think about me 
The more that I believe 
That nothings ever out of reach 
So dream dream dream 

I breathe your visions 
They pull me through the coldest of nights 
They steer me towards a moment in time 
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, Yea 

Whoaooo your givin' me the will to try 
And you know there's desire in these eyes

Hah, it's like my birthday 
Every time you look at me 
I feel the earthquake 
Every time that you dream 

Whoaooo your thoughts are gonna lift me up 
Do you know, its good to want to much, much 
Oh you make me dance in the rain 
And oh I want to love once again 
The more you think about me 
The more that I believe 
That nothing's ever out of reach 
So dream dream dream

Comes back around
Seems that's the way
Heartache falls

I learned to live 
Without you by my side
But I prayed
For the day you'd call

So why don't you
Lie down beside me
Open your heart
And confide in me

[Chorus]
Go on and cry
Here's my shoulder
Why don't you try
To imagine that I even care
Go on and cry
On my cold shoulder
You left me so sad
And you hurt me so bad
It's your turn to 
Cry cry cry
Over me

You say you made
A big mistake
When you threw away
The love I gave

I always knew
You'd come around again
Looking for the love
We made

Sometimes love
Is overrated
It can be so hard

'Cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire

Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
The different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothin' left but sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher-that was me-I told 'er

On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say, my love

When the mirror crashed I called you, and turned to hear you say
If only for today I am unafraid

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Quench me when I'm thirsty;
Come on and cool me down, baby, when I'm hot. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Your recipe is, darlin' is so tasty,
When you show and stir your pot. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

So: stir it up, oh!
Little darlin', stir it up; wo, now!
Come on and stir it up, oh-ah!
Little darlin', stir it up!

Come on and stir it up, wo-o-a!
Little darlin', stir it up! Stick with me, baby!
Come on, come on and stir it up, oh-oh!

Diana King,"-P. Barrett-

Mi tired fi every evening me go home
Me girl a tell me the same thing over and over again
Bwoy, she just keep repeating every time
The girl always a say. Hear weh she say

I am saying,
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back
Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I am appointed by Jah
To go everywhere and preach
People of this world
Request that I speak
I am present in the studio
Seven nights of the week
And working hard to make two ends meet
So erase all the negative thoughts from your mind
Don't judge me by the past 'cause I am right this time
'Cause although for a week I am not in your sight
You should not be saying awful things like
Oh stop delaying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I have not lied
God knows I have tried
To reach your heart but that has been denied
So I am asking you to observe each side
And please let your conscience be your guide
I know that maybe you are not in one of the best mood
But that should not dictate your attitude
The wrong decision could be devastating
'Cause in the long run you will be sorry that you sing

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I know what I must do for the people of this world
Every woman every man and every boy and girl
You should be giving me strength so that I go along
Instead of making this false accusation
It's kind of shocking but I am still watching
If you will be changing that old saying
You know what I am thinking is that you are not willing
To do some listening you keep repeating

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I always believe that you could understand
'Cause we had some much of these conversations
If I went out with another woman
That would be giving justification
You speech is causing embarrassment
And I am sure this time that I am innocent
Since you insist you get your heart content
But make sure you can stand the consequence

I am still saying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

I'm gonna find my way back
No matter what I must do
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
I wish I could turn back the
Time
Life was so much sweeter
Then, my friend
The only thing that keeps
Me alive
Is believing I'll be in your
Arms again, once again
If it takes my whole life through
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter what I must do
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
Even if I lose it all,
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter how far I fall,
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
Find my way back, find my
Way back,
Find my way back to you",Find My Way Back,1997

Diana King,"Little sister
Spends her whole
Life searching,
For the man who can

Touch her heart
But the lover that she's
With ain't working
I hate to see her cry,

Why can't she realize
She deserves a better situation,
Then a fist and a kiss goodnight
I wish she'd take another's invitation

To see that real love, is more than
Being tough
Sister, don't be afraid to let him go
You got to love yourself,

If you want somebody else to love you
You've got to love yourself,
You've got to reach inside,
If you're ever gonna find someone

To love you
You got to love yourself
I don't want to preach the bible
I just want to reach the truth

A loverman shouldn't be your rival
Only to raise a hand,
Never to understand
There's a voice inside every person

That can speak when
The heart is numb
You've got to scream
Before the body worsens

You're just a step away,
From being free of pain
Sister, don't be afraid to let him go
You got to love yourself,

If you want somebody
Else to love you
You got to love yourself,
You've got to reach inside,

Someone to love you
You got to love yourself

Diana King,"Hi how you doing, long time no see
Still remember your face cause I see it
In my dreams
Boy you're looking good, but then

You always did

Is she the one you're with
Don't tell me you want us, to be friends

That's something I just can't do
Boyfriend I'm sorry, forgive me
I got plans for you
I don't like your new girlfriend

'Cause she's standing in the place
Where I should have been
I don't like your new girlfriend
She's messing with my head

She's sleaping in my bed
See I had it all worked out
To get you back as my man
To have her in my way

Wasn't part of the plan
What is this I see, a new
Shinning diamond ring
Are you sure she has no secrets

'Cause I've heard so many things
Was it so easy, to leave me 
And find somebody new
You'll be sorry, without me

She's no good for you
I don't like your new galfriend
'Cause she's standing in the place
Where I should have been

I don't like your new galfriend
She's messing with my head
She's sleeping in my bed
I don't like your new girlfriend

And I don't think that you should
Ever see her again

Diana King,"I watch you as you sleep
I think about tomorrow
And pray you'll never go
Somewhere I couldn't follow

Young as we are now
We won't live forever, sad but true
If you went away
I'd still be loving you

Still be wanting you
Looking in your eyes
I see our children's children
Sure as the sun will rise

Together we shall see them
But if this can not be
Time won't change
The way I feel, it's true

If only you knew
I'd still be loving you
Still be wanting you
Even if you weren't mine

I wouldn't care, I'll be there

I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star

How quick they pass

Are parking cars and pumping gas

It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone

Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

Steady and strong, it does not know defeat

I cannot fall, for I recall
We were born in majesty

And when the long fight, has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun

And we will touch the sky
Together we will dance in robes of gold
And we will leave the world remembering

When one man climbs, the rest are lifted up
With every step we're closer yet
To a higher destiny

And when we reach out to claim the thrown
Every man will know

Rolls around like she got the flow

Picks her up in a back limousine
If he treat her like a beauty queen
She'll let him in-between

To give her everything that she dream of
Want a suga, suga
She want the ice and cash and the beamer
She don't wanna work, she jus' put on a short skirt
Lip gloss and a cutoff T-Shirt
Suga, suga, she want the money, money, suga money

Everyday she wake up in the afternoon
Turn on the TV and watch cartoons
Another hour getting pretty in the bathroom
She won't be looking for work anytime soon
No you may hate her, but that don't faze her
Who are you to criticize her behavior
She don't wanna be all up in love
She don't want no broke ass man
She gonna get it all while she's young
You gotta understand

She got the Stoly and the Roly and the furs
And if she want it then it's gonna be hers
She's a playa and she knows how to play

Can take a kiss without regret

He knows if you've been bad or good

Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

A thing or two
We will make changes, as any family will
But we will always be called

I am as constant as a northern star"" and I said
Constantly in the darkness

If you want me I'll be in the bar

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
But you taste so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling
Still be on my feet
i Still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time that you told me, you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
And you taste sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said
Go to him
Stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed

Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine

Diana Krall,"The glitter on a paint and plaster face
Is covering desire and disgrace
We could be lovers
But no one suspects at all
Once you're inside that costume ball

And now I'm sitting here before the mirror
I have the skill still to disguise my tears
Then as the magic starts to fade
I find myself abandoning the masquerade

Even though you're suffering
You try to hide it
And pretend you're so nonchalant
You can cry a pool of tears
And sit beside it
Then perhaps you'll know what you want

I hope you never feel this much despair
Or know the meaning of that empty chair
As the illusions that we made all fall away
In this abandoned masquerade",Abandoned Masquerade,2004

Dark and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took a ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How am I ever going to know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue, blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
Diving, diving, diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky

I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window

I saw a back crow flying

Diana Krall,"The fading scent of summertime
Arbutus trees and firs
The glistening of rain-soaked moss
Going to the dairy queen at dusk
Down narrow roads
In autumn light

The salt air and the sawmills
And the bars are full of songs and tears
To the passing of the tugboats
And people with their big ideas

It's long ago and far away
Now we're skimming stones and
Exchanging rings
And scattering and sailing from departure bay

The house was bare of Christmas lights
It came down hard that year
Outside in our overcoats
Drinking down to the bitter end
Trying to make things right
Like my mother did

Last year we were laughing
We sang in church so beautifully
Now her perfume's on the bathroom counter
And I'm sitting in the back pew crying

I just get home and then I leave again
It's long ago and far away
Now we're skimming stones and
Exchanging rings
And scattering and sailing from departure bay

And thoughts turn back to life
We took the long way to get back
Like driving over the malahat
Now a seaplane drones and time has flown

I won't miss all the glamour
While my heart is beating and the lilacs bloom
But who knew when I started
That Id find a love and bring him home

She knows by now
There's something ain't know other fears
Now she wears this thread bare
She sits on the floor
The glass press tight to the wall
She hears murmurs low
The paper is peeling
Her eyes staring straight at the ceiling

Baby be there
Or maybe it's nothing at all
As she draws lipstick smears on the wall

The girl in the other room
She powders her face
And stares hard into her reflection

She ?
Adjusting the strap of her gown
She tosses her tresses
Her lover undresses
Turning the last night life down
What's that voice we're hearing
We should be sleeping
Could there be someone who's weeping
Maybe she's there
Maybe there's nothing to see
Just a trace of what used to be

She darkens her lash and blushes
She seems to look familiar",The Girl in the Other Room,2004

And only saw my Mother's hand
The things I've earned
They never came too cheap

But then the likeness only goes so deep
As clouds approach the facing shore

I can't pretend I don't descend
I know I should be joyful now
But time means nothing
Only the love you gave to me can save me

I think she knew
I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now

I looked down at a twist of lace
And only saw my Father's face
The things we shared

Have hurt us both so much sometimes
We each go places love can't touch
A calendar marks days to keep
The moon shone down

Upon chill waters running deep
The veil so thin that light poured in
The sight was so astonishing
That time meant nothing
Only a kiss that felt like this cloud move me

I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now

Knowing it's dangerous to follow

Practicing blowing up smoke rings
I learned of the sadness
The beauty and bitterness
But since those days
I've changed everything

I ran my hands down silent keys
For secrets like these
And ever since
They turn up on my fingerprints

And he'll wonder whether

Summer is near

Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through

Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?

I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again

Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone

Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old
Wooden cross

Diana Krall,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
She was born in spring, but I was born too late

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people are saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

May as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

May I be first to dance you round the floor?
The very first to see your face by moonlight?
The very first to walk you to your door?

Well, young man, I'd be delighted
There is nothing I would rather do
What could be a sweeter memory
Than sharing my first dance with you?

I want to be the first man you remember

The very first to sweep me off my feet

I want to be the one you always turn to

The first to make my young heart miss a beat

Seems the stars are far below us
The moon has never felt so close before
Our first dance will be forever
And may it lead to many more!
I want to be the first man you remember

The very first to sweep me off my feet

I want to be the one you always turn to
The first to make your young heart miss a beat

The very first

Diana Myron,"You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame
You've got the banjos strummin' and plunkin' out a tune to beat the band
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland.
You make our cotton easy to pick, Mame
You give my old mint julep a kick, Mame
You make the old magnolia tree blossom at the mention of your name.
You've made us feel alive again, you've given us the drive again
to make the South revive again, Mame.
You brought the cakewalk back into style, Mame
You make the weeping willow tree smile, Mame
Your skin is Dixie satin, there's rebel in your manner and your speech
You may be from Manhattan, but Georgia never had a sweeter peach.
You make our blackeyed peas and our grits, Mame
Seem like the bill of fare at the Ritz, Mame
You came, you saw, you conquered and absolutely nothing is the same.
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational, we think you're just sensational,
Mame...Mame...Mame!",Mame,1999
Diana Navarro,"El olvido recordó 
Y la oscuridad se iluminó
La risa rompió a llorar

Una piedra enamoró 
A una virgen que dejó caer 
Su desnudez

Empieza el ritual, So 
Cuerpos a media luz do
Beben de otras bocas, mía
Y se excitan

Lamen la lujuria So 
Que lubrica su piel, do
Y hasta las estrellas mía 
Se masturban al ver

Déjate enamorar
Ven y únete
Desnuda tu pudor 
Y entrégate al placer

Déjate enamorar
Sedúceme
Y por la depravación
Déjate acariciar

El frío se arropó 
Y un árbol ha echado a correr
La Cruz está al revés

El vicio es la virtud
La castidad es bisexual
La decadencia está a estrenar

Es la misa al revés, So 
Se consagra lo inmoral, do 
El aquelarre del pecado mía 

Cuerpos entregados So 
En lasciva comunión, do 
Santa bacanal en el altar mía 

Déjate enamorar
Ven y únete
Desnuda tu pudor 
Y entrégate al placer

Déjate enamorar
Sedúceme
Y por la depravación
Déjate acariciar

Muéstrame tu cuello y deja 
Que mis colmillos rompan 
La piel que impide 
Que tu sangre sea para mí
Y tu vida será eterna
Morirás cada mañana
Y renacerás al anochecer

Oh Señor de las mentiras, Natalia Martín 
Mendigo de otras vidas
Duque del vicio, príncipe del sexo 
Y del dolor
La lascivia que en mí entre
Me corrompa y me reviente 
El alma en trozos de placer

El pentáculo es mi cama
Permite que te laman
Y no sabrás si te acarician 
Un hombre o mujer

Violaremos tu inocencia, Natalia y José 
Orgasmos y decadencia
Alguien se excita en una cruz
Y la brisa de la muerte 
Pudrirá lo que es decente
Ven y déjate sodomizar

Soy Astaroth, soy Belial
Soy Lucifer, soy tu puta
Soy tu chulo
Lo que quieras tú
Soy Leviatán, tuve sexo con Adán
Mientras Eva se excitaba 
Al vernos, y se unió!

Déjate enamorar
Ven y únete
Desnuda tu pudor 
Y entrégate al placer

Déjate enamorar

Y por la depravación
Déjate acariciar

Diana Pierce,"Just another homeless family
Hoping for a stranger's charity
Just one night in one safe place to stay
Underneath a star so far away

She carried everything they had and more
The little one the world was waiting for
And somewhere in the night her child was born
Into every heart so tired and torn

And the light shining from that star
Will show you who you are
And his life shining with its light
Will lead you through your darkest night

They couldn't find a room for him back then
But he found a place in the hearts of men
The hope that all the world would come to know
Born beneath that star so long ago

Hoping for a stranger's charity
Just one night in one safe place to stay
Underneath a star so far away

Diana Reyes,"Desde hoy, le he prohibido a mis ojos
El mirarte de nuevo a la cara
Tienes algo que acaba conmigo
Y a mi mente, de mi alma separa

Tengo que
Renunciar a quererte
Antes que
Ya no tenga remedio

Si mi vida
Dejara tu suerte
Mi camino
Sera un cementerio mas

Y basta ya
De tu inconciencia
De esta forma tan absurda

De ver a diario como echas a la basura
Mi corazon
Lo que te doy, con tanta fe
De ver en ti felicidad

Me llevare
La dignidad de no caer mas en tu juego
Hare de todo mi interior nuevos senderos
Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

Y basta ya, de tu inconciencia
De esta forma tan absurda
De ver a diario como echas a la basura
Mi corazon, lo que te doy, con tanta fe
De ver en ti felicidad

Me llevare
La dignidad de no caer mas en tu juego
Hare de todo mi interior nuevos senderos
Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

",Basta Ya,2004
Diana Reyes,"En un dia de estos en el que suelo pensar
""Hoy va a ser el di­a menos pensado""
Nos hemos cruzado has decidido mirar
A los ojitos azules que ahora van a tu lado

Desde el momento en el que te conoci
Resumiendo con prisas tiempo de silencio
Te juro que a nadie le he vuelto a decir
Que tenemos el record del mundo en querernos

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto soy asi

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde
Como siempre la esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si­""

Escapando una noche de un bostezo de sol
Me pediste que te diera un beso.
Con lo barato que sale mi amor
Que te cuesta callarme con uno de esos

Pasaron seis meses y me dijiste adios
Fue un placer coincidir en esta vida
Ahi me quede en una mano el corazon
Y en la otra excusas que ni tu entendi­as.

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi­
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto soy asi.

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
La esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si­""

Y es que empiezo a pensar
Que el amor verdadero es tan solo el primero
Y es que empiezo a sospechar
Que los demas son solo para olvidar

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto, soy asi

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
La esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si""

Pende de un hilo la esperanza mía

Porque de pronto ya no me quería
Porque mi vida se quedo vacía
Nadie contesta mis preguntas, porque
Nada me queda, sin el

Se fue
Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos
Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio
Se fue, su sonrisa de fábula
Se fue, la dulce miel que probé en sus labios

Se fue, me quedo solo su veneno
Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue
Se fue, y desde entonces ya solo tengo lagrimas

Encadenada a noches de locura
Hasta a la cárcel yo iría con el
Toda una vida no basta, sin el

En mi verano ya no sale el sol
Con su tormenta, todo destruyo
Rompiendo en mil pedazos esos sueños que construimos, ayer

Se fue
Se fue, me quedo solo su recuerdo
Se fue, y su amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue
Se fue, y la razón no la se

Se dice dios que a de acordarse de mi
Aunque se, que entre el y yo
El cielo solo tiene nubes negras
Le rogare, le buscare, lo juro, le encontrare
Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas

En esta vida oscura, absurda sin el
Siento que
Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo

Si tiene limite, el amor, lo pasaría por el
Y en el vacío inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento
¡le amare¡

Como le pude amar la vez primera
Que un beso suyo era una vida entera
Sintiendo como me pierdo
Por el

Se fue
Se fue, me quedo solo su recuerdo
Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue

Porque sé que esto ya no es querer

Es algo más, algo que me llena
Algo que no mata ni envenena
Es algo más, algo más que amar

Es algo más que la distancia
Que el dolor y la nostalgia
Sabemos que eso no nos va a separar

Es darte un beso cada noche
Que tus manos me enamoren
Y que lo nuestro crezca cada día más

Porque somos algo más
A veces creo que he vivido
Más de mil años contigo
Porque sé que esto ya no es querer

A veces pienso que es mentira
Por como entraste en mi vida
Porque sé que esto ya no es querer

Es algo más, algo que me llena
Algo que no mata ni envenena
Es algo más, algo más que amar

Es algo más que la distancia
Que el dolor y la nostalgia
Sabemos que eso no nos va a separar

Es darte un beso cada noche
Que tus manos me enamoren
Y que lo nuestro crezca cada día más

Y yo sé que no es querer
Porque en tus ojos yo me puedo perder
Contigo olvido lo que es temer
Acaso no sabes que tú eres para mí

La noche, el día en mí vivir
La sangre en mis venas
Lo doy todo por ti

Contigo el mundo no tiene final
Y el tiempo no se nos va a acabar

Es algo más que la distancia
Que el dolor y la nostalgia
Sabemos que eso no nos va a separar

Es darte un beso cada noche
Que tus manos me enamoren
Y que lo nuestro crezca cada día mas

Diana Reyes,"Así es la ley, hay
Un ángel hecho para mí
Te conocí el viento
Se me fue tal como llego

Y te fallé, te hice
Daño tantos años yo
Pasé por todo sin pensar
Te amé

Sin casi amar
Y al final quien me salvo
Fue el ángel que quiero yo

De nuevo tú te vuelas
En mis huesos
Dejándome tú beso
Junto al corazón

Y otra vez tú
Abriéndome tus alas
Me sacas de las malas

Rachas de dolor
Porque tú eres
El ángel que quiero yo

Cuando estoy fatal
Ya no se qué hacer
Ni adonde ir, me fijo en ti
Y te siento cerca pensando en mí

El cuerpo se me
Va hacia donde tu estas
Mi vida cambio el ángel
Que quiero yo

De nuevo tú te vuelas
En mis huesos
Dejándome tú beso
Junto al corazón

Y otra vez tú
Abriéndome tus alas
Me sacas de las malas

Rachas de dolor
Porque tú eres
El ángel que quiero yo

Diana Reyes,"Aire, en esta linda
Tarde de verano
Tu recuerdo es una foto gris
Que las horas

Van difuminando
Que difícil dibujar tus rasgos
Medio día después de partir

Aire si tus ojos
Eran higos negros
Si los dientes
Viejos de limón

No recuerdo
El largo de tus cejas
Ni siquiera puedo hablar
Apenas de otra cosa
Que no sea tu olor

La mente cuando baja la marea
Por puro instinto de
Conservación intento

Cauterizar cada
Huella que deja atrás
El paso del amor

La mente cuando baja la marea
Buscando la escultura
Del dolor activo

Un mecanismo
De defensa para
Que no se ahogue el corazón

Bello, con tu perfecto
Perfil tan libreo
Desalineado lleno
De proyectos hombros
Cargados y zapatos viejos

La mente cuando baja
La marea por puro instinto
De conservación intento
Cauterizar cada huello

Que deja atrás el paso del amor
La mente cuando baja
La marea buscando la escultura

Del dolor activo
Un mecanismo de defensa
Para que no se ahogue el corazón

En esta linda tarde
De verano

Tu recuerdo es una foto gris
(Apenas perfilada)
Que las horas van difuminando
(Oh, no)

Aire
(Intento dibujar)
Mientras me espero casi ya no puedo
(Por mucho que lo intento)

Qué difícil es reconocer
(Con todo lo que eh amado)
Que no me has dejado
Apenas huella

Y el naufragó ya es total, que pena

",Cuando Baja La Marea,2007
Diana Reyes,"Daría lo que fuera por tener
Tan solo unos segundos
Para desaparecer
Pero sigo tan visible como ayer

Daría lo que fuera por saber
Que el suelo sigue
Aquí bajo mis pies
Pero no, sigo siendo
Tan volátil como ayer

Y daría, tantas cosas daría
Sólo porque este mundo
No girara tan de prisa
Tantas cosas daría

Por no ver tus manías
Por quedarme colgada
Una vez más de tu sonrisa

Daría lo que fuera por saber
Que piensas cuando
Dices que todo va bien
Tal vez, tendría
Una razón para correr

Y daría, tantas cosas daría
Solo porque este mundo
No girara tan de prisa
Tantas cosas daría

Nos conocimos
Un tiempo tú el mar y el cielo
Quien me trajo a ti

Abrazaste mis
Abrazos vigilando
Aquel momento
Que fuera el primero
Y lo guardará para mí

Te vería cada día amanecer
Sonriendo como cada
Vez como aquella vez

Te voy a escribir la canción
Más bonita del mundo
Voy a capturar nuestra
Historia en tan solo

Un segundo, y un día verás que
Este loco de poco se olvida
Por mucho que
Pasen los años de largo en su vida

El día de la despedida
De esta playa de mi vida
Te hice una promesa
Volverte a ver así

No se por que dices que haz visto en mis ojos 
Que estaba llorando de celos por ti
Por mas que me veas aveces llorosa 
No creas que siento el amor que perdí

La prueba bien clara esta tarde haz tenido 
Pasaste con otra pa´ verme sufrir 
Y en ves de enojarme como tu haz creído 
Di vuelta a la cara y me puse a reír

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías 
Antes si lloraba 
Pero ya no lloro por tu corazón
Pero si me acuerdo de aquellos momentos en los que me decías 
Que me amabas mucho con todo el cariño de tu corazón 
Pero no lo creas 
No he sido tan tonta que haz vencido mi alma 
Nunca te he querido para que negarlo
No quiero tu amor 

Hay la primera vez llore
La segunda ya no me dolió 
Y la tercera ya ni me acuerdo

No quiero negarlo que estuve celosa 
Al ver que con otra te burlas de mi 
Después de que fue mio el calor de tu boca 
Y yo que en los labios mil besos te di

Nunca había pensado llorar un cariño
Nunca había sabido lo que erea sufrir 
Pero te haz marchado sin darme ni un beso
Que pena dios mio me siento morir

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

Come and smear all my lipstick
If you really want my love to share
Ooowee baby

Just one kiss from you is worth
All the talk there in on Earth
A million words don't equal just one touch

If your love is really real
Don't just tell me how you feel
If you really love me oh so much

You need more than words
In this situation
A kiss can do as much
To make communication

Cuddle me closer
And be real good conversation
So hold me tight, tonight's the night
Fill my heart with pure delight

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Kindness was a thread
She used to weave my world apart
There were three of us seen all over town
Now there's only two
Someone's missing 
Guess who?

Now I see how she schemed 
And worked her way in between
Planted seeds of mistrust
To make us fight unaware
Her comforting ways when I would cry
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye
Just like a snake on the limb tree

When we grow up, will I be pretty?

Will you be big and strong?

Will I wear dresses that show off my knees?

Will you wear trousers twice as long?

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


Hey!

When we grow up, will I be a lady?

Will you be an engineer?

Will I have to wear things like perfume and gloves?

I can still pull the whistle while you steer.

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


When I grow up, I'm gonna be happy and do what I like to do,

Like making noise and making faces and making friends like you.

And when we grow up, do you think we'll see

That I'm still like you and you're still like me?

I might be pretty; you might grow tall.

But we don't have to change at all.


Spoken: I don't want to change, see, 'cause I still want to be your friend, forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

Will I wear dresses that show off my knees?

Will you wear trousers twice as long?

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


Hey!

When we grow up, will I be a lady?

Will you be an engineer?

Will I have to wear things like perfume and gloves?

I can still pull the whistle while you steer.

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


When I grow up, I'm gonna be happy and do what I like to do,

Like making noise and making faces and making friends like you.

And when we grow up, do you think we'll see

That I'm still like you and you're still like me?

I might be pretty; you might grow tall.

But we don't have to change at all.


Spoken: I don't want to change, see, 'cause I still want to be your friend, forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

Diana Ross,"Way back in '29, 1929, somewhere in Coffeeville
Was a Honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy
She had a sweetheart, mean Little Melvin
And hell would fly between them every Saturday night

Why? Because Little Melvin, he got wild on bathtub gin
Well, it made him feel like he was almost twice his size
So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes

Ya see, Big Mable Murphy, she loved her Little Melvin
But he never did learn to do just what she said
'Cause poor Little Melvin, woke up early every morning
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Late one rainy night, Scarface, muscle and all might
He came in and started shoving everybody around
Well, Big Mable Murphy, she was way back in the kitchen
So just for fun, ol' Scarface shot Little Melvin down

Early next morning, down by the river
They say, old Scarface was found real short of breath
They say, he died, uhh, oh, the man died from a good ol' whipping
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Big Mable, Big Mable Murphy
She gave him two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Diana Ross,"There is a place we'll go
Where there is mostly quiet
Flowers and butterflies
A rainbow lives beside it

And from a velvet sky
A summer storm
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm

And then a mighty roar
Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even lightening
Will be frightening my lion

And with no fear inside
No need to run, no need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin' you're a lion
In your own way be a lion

Come on, be a lion

I'm standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all
If on courage you must call
Keep on tryin', and tryin', and tryin'

I'm a lion in my own way
I'm a lion, a lion, a lion, a lion

",Be a Lion,1978
Diana Ross,"If you believe within your heart you'll know
That no one can change the path that you must go
Believe what you feel and know you're right, because
The time will come around when you say it's yours

Believe there's a reason to be
Believe you can make time stand still
You know from the moment you try
If you believe, I know you will

Believe in yourself, right from the start
You'll have brains, you'll have a heart
You'll have courage to last your whole life through

If you believe in yourself, if you believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself as I believe in you

",Believe in Yourself (Dorothy),1978
Diana Ross,"Lose it, lose it
I don't even know the first thing
About what they're feeling

What am I afraid of?
Don't know what I'm made of
Can I go on not knowing?

Feeling, feeling, something tells me
That it's more than I can deal with
Though I never knew the song

Some words still catch on
Like caring and sharing
Being together no matter

Can I go on not knowing?
Don't know what I'm made of
Why am I afraid of feeling? Feeling

If I dare to take a chance
Would someone lead me?

Only last a little while

Diana Ross,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Soon as I Get Home/Home,1978

Makes it hard to sleep
Don't take my word
Ask any girl

Who receives no loving affection

Many nights without slumber

I go to bed with the prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears

Hugging and kissing
Ooh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
",Lover Man,1983
Diana Ross,"My love was in a storm
The bitter wind was blowin' around me
I'd sit and cry but
By and by it just faded away

Rainbow, painted skies,
Brought a smile into my eyes
The scent of flowers filled the air
I turned around and you were there

Hey, you made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

Ooh ooh, since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

One kiss is worth a thousand sighing words
When you're lonely
I saw you smile
It was warm
Now I see beyond the storm

Clouds are fading fast
There goes the sad and bitter past
You touched my life
When no one cared
You did the things that no one dared
You've opened doors

You've made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' givin' again

Diana Ross
(P. Sawyer/G. Jones)

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put om ny face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

But on that lucky night
I found me loving you

is to fall in love with
