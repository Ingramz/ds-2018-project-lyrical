James Yuill,"Be the greatest man in history
The greatest man that you can be
Just be

Walk, walk out on the beach with me
Walk out in the sea with me
Just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

Nights, cold nights wrapped in ecstasy
Those times still perplexing be
They just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love, this sweet love
This sweet love, this sweet love

",This Sweet Love,2007
James Yuill,"We shared our love with you
All the while we never knew what you do

You build them up so high
And knock them from their little stools
You always do, you always do

So I stayed up all night
And read you books with fond delight
With fond delight, with fond delight

Marion lift up your head
Won't you stay with me tonight?
Won't you stay with me my love?
Won't you stay? Won't you stay?

James Zollar,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1998
James Zollar,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2009

Jamey Aebersold,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Jamey Aebersold,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1996
Jamey Aebersold,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Jamey Aebersold,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullabye of Birdland,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1999
Jamey Aebersold,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Jamey Aebersold,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Jamey Aebersold,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2000
Jamey Aebersold,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,2000
Jamey Aebersold,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2000
Jamey Aebersold,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2000
Jamey Aebersold,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2000
Jamey Aebersold,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,

Jamey Aebersold,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes

Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

Jamey Aebersold,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty

Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Jamey Aebersold,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

For many years where I may lay.
Then you may learn to love another,

Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime

Jamey Johnson,"Standing at that pawn shop counter
Trying on the wedding rings
She said she needed silver
'Cause gold just turns her green
I counted out the twenties
And I laid the money down
And we went straight to the Davidson courthouse
After three long years together
She found a banker man
She said she was thinking 'bout her future
And gave me back that silver band
I had it melted down
So I could wear in on a chain
Now it's a flying silver eagle that used to be a ring

I'd rather have this silver eagle
Than all that rich man's gold
It's my one reminder of
A women turning cold
Her love lies in his money
And mines in a pair of wings
On a flying silver eagle that used to be a ring

I couldn't put the past behind me
So I put it in a song
That's how I tell the story
How that women did me wrong
Now I tour across the country
Riding high on the wings
Of a flying silver eagle that used to be a ring

I'd rather have this silver eagle
Than all that rich man's gold
It's my one reminder of
A women turning cold
Her love lies in his money
And mines in a pair of wings
On a flying silver eagle that used to be a ring

I met a homeless man on Broadway
He was holding out his hand
He asked me for a dollar
Said he was once a banker man
'Til that lady took his money
I said man I feel your pain
You might could use this silver eagle
You know it used to be a ring",Flying Silver Eagle,2006

Through the wind shield of my Chevrolet

On a chert rock gravel road

That's the story of my life
Like tryin' to remember words
To a song nobody wrote

And it's sad and its long
And can't nobody sing along
Its a southbound train
Its a whistle in the wind
Ain't nobody there to care where I been
I'm humming on that lonesome song again

I took a trip across the country, to Montgomery
Discovered I'd been wrong for so long
I thought it was a the fame and the glory and the money
But all I got to show is a damn song

And it's sad and its long

I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound

In the park I saw a daddy, 
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to a song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams 
Of yesterday

Jamey Johnson,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Jami Sieber,"Come wander quietly and listen to the wind
Come here and listen to the sky
Come walking high above the rolling of the sea
And watch the swallows as they fly

There is no sorrow like the murmur of their wings
There is no choir like their song
There is no power like the freedom of their flight
While the swallows roam alone

Do you hear the calling of a hundred thousand voice
Hear the trumbling in the stone
Do you hear the angry bells ringing in the night
Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?

And will the breezes blow the petals from your hand
And will some loving ease your pain
And will the silence strike confusion from your soul
And will the swallows come again?",A Swallow Song,1998

J'ai laissé dans une mandarine
Une coquille de noix bleu marine
Un morceau de mon cœur et une voile
Planqués sous le vent tropical
Dans un pays sucrée doucement
J'suis né dans le gris par accident
Dans mes tiroirs dans mon sommeil
Jolie doudou sous le soleil

J'ai laissé sur un planisphère
Entre capricorne et cancer
Des point entourés d'eau des îles
Une fille au corps immobile
Mais pour bien la biguine danser
Faudrait ma peau ta peau toucher
T'es tellement, tellement loin de moi
Qu'la biguine je la danse pas.

Y el sol que se fue
J'en passe j'en passe j'en passe des nuits, des nuits
Des nuits à caresser du papier
Des lettres de toi

Je voudrais tellement tellement tellement être là-bas

Habría que tener placer
Y estas tan lejos de mi

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind

Jamie & the First Class,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast

On merely this: a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

They're selling records by the million, seems so easy in my opinion, 
Look at the Jazz Star, he really needs some guts 
Playing from seven to midnight, surviving on peanuts 
Selling records by the dozen 
Probably sold his tenor to make 'em 
With artwork designed by his brother 
And liner notes by his mother 

Told what to do, miming to a tape 
While a team of experts make sure you're looking great 
Taking a limo to your own private bar 
My God! I want to be a popstar! 

Going to get on the T.V and go on dates with only the pretty 
Maybe next year I'll pretend to be gay 
I'll sell more records in a flash that way 
Makes no difference if i look like a nut 
Every kid in the world is going to copy my haircut 
I'll advertise some trainers, maybe even a car 
Product placement will gurantee I'm a star 
An ugly guy will write my songs 
Surley there is nothing wrong 
Retiring when I'm 22 
With a house a car and nothing to do 

Instantaneous satisfaction it will be 
Got no need for artistic credibility 
With this attitude I'm bound to go far 
My God! I want to be a popstar! 

Where's the middle ground? 
It's hard to make a living with you own true sound 
What road am I going to tread? 
What the hell would i do instead? 

There may be no tours in Roma, or drug-induced designer coma 
No teenage girls when show is over, I prefer my women older 
Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about 
Sometimes it would be nice to play a place and sell out 
Driving to a gig in my brand new sports car

So then we tried, ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes, and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin' babe)

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)

I'm too old to be frontin' when I'm feeling Denzel

They're the ones who'll spit at you,
You will be the one screaming out

Jamie Cullum,"After years of expensive education
A car full of books and anticipation
I'm an expert on Shakespeare and that's a hell of a lot
But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought
Maybe I'll go traveling for a year
Finding myself, or start a career
Could work the poor, though I'm hungry for fame
We all seem so different but we're just the same
Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat
Aren't things more easy, with a tight six pack
Who knows the answers, who do you trust
I can't even separate love from lust
Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans
Working nine to five, answering phones
But don't make me live for Friday nights
Drinking eight pints and getting in fights
Maybe I'll just fall in love
That could solve it all
Philosophers say that that's enough
There surely must be more
Love ain't the answer, nor is work
The truth eludes me so much it hurts
But I'm still having fun and I guess that's the key
I'm a twentysomething and I'll keep being me",Twentysomething,2004

And the clowns have all gone to bed,
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street,
Footprints dress in red.

And the wind whispers Mary.

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life.
Somewhere a Queen is weeping,
Somewhere a King has no wife.

And the wind cries Mary.

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
Shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'cause the life that they lived is dead.

And the wind screams Mary.

Oh oh yeah

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, ""No, this will be the last.""

And the wind cries Mary.",Wind Cries Mary,2004

To disappear within your mind
You never know what you might find

And keep those records playin', playin', playin'

So many years ago I was so low and lonely and depressed 
I hadn't left my flat in weeks and never even bothered getting dressed 
And I was smoking weed and I was in a mess and that's when it happened

And even wives and they would always attend to my every need

You called me a useless, selfish prick
So I'm in a fix right now

Can nothing I say bring us back together

And you called me a stupid twat

Jamie Cullum,"I met a girl at the beach
It was underneath a blazing sun,
Just like usual I was looking for a little fun,
I was sitting and chilling out
And listening to the braking waves
That's when the day really started to change

Rising out of the sea like Excalibur's sword,
All the men they're staring and the women they scorn
A glorious vision, the seventh deadly sin,
Tall, tanned and lovely like songs from Jobim

I started to gather my one thousand things,
The sand's in my shoes and my skins' been burning
It's very different where I'm from
So its hard to be like a true beach bum
I just get dizzy in the midday sun

She seems to dance around, she's born for this place,
Always next to her she keeps the same old battered books
Sometimes right over her face
A beautiful full moon party
She lives in the light of day
And is she reading 'A Picture of Dorian Gray'
Okay

She's a towering inferno of restless energy
But she's as patient as students of ornithology
She seems to wait for nothing but the close of the day
Then all of a sudden, just like I had prayed
I see her start to look my way
I'm as self-conscious and nervous as a first time virgin drug smuggler
I'm doing my best to keep my eyes from constantly being obvious and staring at her
I play with my phone, start texting a mate,
I hope they call back, that sucks
'Cause I'm here, she's hot and it's great

I take a little walk, over to the bar on the beach
The other English guys are as burnt as me
I order a beer 'cause I'm feeling real thirsty
I know it should be water 'cause this'll dehydrate me

To my surprise as I am sitting here
She sits right down right next to me and orders a beer
She speaks just like a native girl, she's humming a song
I'm resisting every tempting moment where I'm thinking I can just sing right along
Singing along

And now I can't believe it
But she asked me where I'm from,
Her accent is thick
I definitely wasn't wrong,
I tell her I'm from London
And she seems impressed
We start joking about the cold
The wind, the rain and the fog
Well all I try and do is stop staring at her chest

She'd love to move away and pursue her career
She studied at the university over here
She said she had some trouble getting hold of a visa
I said I would marry her, seem to please her

It was all going well so I ordered some shots (shots)
It went straight to my head 'cause I was tired and hot (hot)
This girl she had no problems with all of the tequila
I was just so shamelessly trying to feed her

I knew I was mangled when I tried to stand
I had double vision and the room span
She grabbed my arm to keep me steady
And she asked me in that cute voice ""Are you feeling horny?""

We were staggering up the four flights of stairs together
I began to imagine me pursuing pleasure
As we entered the room she began to undress
She seductively asked me to turn around quickly to increase the suspense
Closing my eyes was like entering a vortex
Was I even going to manage to get through the sex
And so before it even all began
She battered me over the head with the bedside lamp

I awoke the next morning
And I was feeling like crap
All that was left was the shirt on my back
She must have spiked my drink
I could feel it in my throat
On the side of the table she'd left me a note
Thanks for last night, I don't need a visa
Why would I move, life is just easier

There's no moral in this tale

Jamie Cullum,"There's a place everyone of us can go to
Maybe you have been there once or twice
Where all your friends just look at you and whisper
They want to give you nothing but advice
When you walk in they all know what you're after
And the higher that you get the more they'll see
In a dark room filled with music, wine and laughter
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly
Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer
Every night it's the same sad old procedure
The doorman winks at you on your way out
'Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning
And he's got something you can't live without
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt
Of an old love's fancy life that left you stranded in a dream
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen

Truthfully I've got the most upper hand
I never seem to finish lovin'
You train your eye and force yourself to make a stand
When it dies a wanted stuffing
Lose yourself and on the edge of reason
Teenage ears do drown
Even I don't know what I am feeling
Lost you until I'm found.

You and me are gone
You and me are gone
Winter's bitter song
You and me are gone, gone away.

Yeah,

See the joyous pro's have left my tongue
For other warmer things,
Battle songs are written to be sung
A million toxic lies.

I spose it means you'll turn up round nine,
Bought a bunch of flowers just for her,
She says the burden's on the receiver,

I opened the door and you walked in,
The scent of wild jasmine,
The room seemed to freeze in time,
My regular table will be just fine,

Radiant and elegant you might be, 
But your concentration is so go-lightly,
Both of your eyes reflect the room,
You really think you own the room,

How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,

And even if you do, that's ok,

Try to pick it up, I'm reading the signs,
It's turning out to be a real good time,
Now who'd have thought that entertainment,
Lies in the winter of our discontent,

We sit at the table, face to face,
Queen takes pawn check on, check mate,
I feel your foot brush against my leg,
I'm not that easily led,

You flutter your eyes and touch your hair,
I have to say that it is kinda unfair,
Now let me tell you baby what's in store,
You win the battle but I'll win the war,

So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,

This has been fun, I suppose,
Although my feelings are all juxtaposed,
Truth be told I'm as fickle as hell,
But a gentleman never kisses and tells,

Jamie Cullum,"After years of expensive education
A car full of books, and anticipation
I'm an expert on Shakesphere, and that's a hell of a lot
But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought

Maybe I'll go traveling for a year,
Finding myself, or start a career
I could work with the poor, though I'm hungry for fame
We all seem so different, but we're just the same

Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat
All things are easy, with a tight six-pack
Who knows the answer, who do you trust
I can't even seperate love from lust

Maybe I'll move back home, and pay off my loans,
Working nine to five, answering phones
Don't make me live for my Friday nights, 
Drinking eight pints and getting in fights

I don't want to get up, just let me lie in
Leave me alone, I'm a twentysomething

Maybe I'll just fall in love, that could solve it all, 
Philosophers say that that's enough
There surely must be more, ooh

Love ain't the answer, nor is work, 
The truth deludes me, so much it hurts,
But I'm still having fun and I guess that the key,

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Yeah

I know you need a little background clear though
About your boy Deltron Zero, your hero
In three thousand thirty
We ain't in the clear though
We was near toast, doing too much, who to trust
In a land so scandalous and grand?
Even the President got his hand in the contraband
They done control the band of information
Leading to education to a brainwaves pulsatin'
They said ""Fuck the Environment!""
For so long the environment said ""Fuck y'all""
OK, now we in a cobra clutch
Once the planet fold up, and blow up

Full scale chaos, reckless abandon
Cats will sell they, hand for a handgun
Follow your commander, though you can't stand him
No plannin', wild and dangerous
Anger just permeate, so we learn to take
Hostility with a grain of salt
And step out the way, cause it ain't our fault
Bank vaults blown to smithereens
Whatever's left is left for the fiends
But you'd better not mess with the team

There in a flash, and not in the pan
It's all in the plan in a lawless land

Creep with me, as I bail through the hood

Even though their enterprises are the crisis
They license been revoked
By the average trench coat
Pulling out so you get smoked

Like hickory sausage
Victory? Come on, it's far from flawless
They ain't God, but their ways is pompous
Thinking they can stomp us with troops and contras
But just let loose a stupid
Monster, unable to be contained
It's too late, they launched it
With no promotion
So now we revolt
And insult they sultan
With explosive voltage

Jamie Cullum,"Know this is a universal truth
People let me down.
So reach out for the things that you can use
Buried in the ground

I think I've been misunderstood,
Not all of my choices have been good
In a fading light.
So we should put this one to bed
Before it bursts out of my head
Ready for the fight.

So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here.
So when it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me here.

Inside of another time of life
Full of big ideas
Strikes me with the baggage left behind
I could dry those tears.

All of my secrets they are free
Now watch them tumble out of me
Into better days.
So safe those homiletic tones
And come just singing from the moles
And you hear me say.

So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here.
When it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me here.

Oh oh oh oh 

So step away from castle walls
Those voices calling in the halls
They are moving on.
So I keep my side of the street
Clearer than our pounding feet
Ever walked to upon.

So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here.
When it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me here.

Jamie Cullum,"There was an age the battered times
were coiled up around you like a diamond cage
Though your sparkle 's long resigned
It flickers like the embers of a dying blaze
These might be the last days of the blinding lights
So you and me should go and get so high tonight

[Chorus: x2]

We crossed the line so many times
It's nothing more than chalk wiped off a darkened wall
Speeding through those crystal nights
Clearly punctuated by some bloody falls
What used to seem so magical now seems so trite
So one more time lets go and get so high tonight

You and me should go and get so high tonight
You and me should go and get so high tonight

They're gonna cut through the windows
Ain't no one messing with my plans
Right now my star is in limbo
Sit back and watch my scrawny frame
Invade your feelings
All the years you caused me pain
I've got some wounds that need healin

Well you were just too damn aloof
Wearing your Morrissey t-shirt
The kind of girl that's born for youth
Well that's a blessing and some curse
I tell you son beware of those
Who peak too early
Cause all that magic can't be froze
And now it's you who ain't worthy

So baby when I get famous
Everybody's gonna see
Oh oh oh
You never really knew me

Does it make sense to simplify
Now we're knotted in riddles
But I don't care, do you know why
The girls are falling like skittles
Whoever said you needed rights
To tame your beauty
I'll say goodbye to lonely nights
Girls form an orderly queue please

So baby when I get famous
Everybody's gonna see
Oh oh oh
You never really knew me

So given knowledge, given time
I'd take us out of recession
I'd tell the world that all was fine
And that there freedom's a blessing
Cause when I'm looking from the top
You'll all seem smaller
Ain't that what all us humans want?
To stand that little bit taller

God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons

Far from greedy if you knew what I come from
Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda
Been another outcome just like most kids

Then you wonder how come I can move in the room
Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth

But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game,
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you
Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'


Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
Came down to south beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother took three and went to jail
I'm sending all my pictures through the mail
He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand",Castle Made of Sand,2011

We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia

I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Jamie Foxx,"(Remix) I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy, then a girl
That want but don't need me
Young independent (yea she work hard)
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty goin' shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays aggressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side,
By looking in her eyes
Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want,
Independent queen,
Workin' for her throne

[Chorus]
I love her 'cause she got her own, she got her own
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own (I love it when she say)
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it

I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy,
Then a girl that want but don't need me
Lovely face, nice thick thighs,
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy thing, she's Ms. Fly
All the while paying her bills on time
She don't look at me like captain save 'em
Gold digging, no she don't do that
Now she look at me like inspiration,
She wanna be complimenting my swag
And everything she got, she work for it,
Good life made for it, she take pride in saying
That she paid for it, only kind of girl I want
Independent queen, working for her throne

[Chorus]

Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too,
Make you even have to but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to
When I do that math boo, you always try and add two
I need someone who ride for me
Not someone who ride for free
She say boy I don't just ride
She'll pull up beside of me, I had to ask her
What she doing in that caddy
She say cause you my baby
I'll be stunting like my daddy
And there's not many, who catch my eye
We both wearin' Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by my side toaster in the holster
And now she went Loso case you didn't know so
You can save your money dog, shawty getting dough so
What she care what his cost, you can call her miss boss
I got it backwards, Kriss Kross shawty got her own

Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing, 
'Cept some of that good lovin' let me here you say oh oh oh oh

And all my fellas know you need to stop the frontin'

Jamie Foxx,"Verse One:
So many sleepless days and sleepless night I spent alone wondering if I can make it make it on my own without someone to hold me with that holding power. If not for a lifetime at east for an hour. But this machine inside my head (ooh, it so cold) I'm hanging by your string never letting go. How my heart breaks how the tears roll. It's you I'm thinking of but don't let the sun come down on my love (oh oh oh)

Verse Two:
Sometimes I think I'm falling and no one is concerned. I'm headed down that pathway to the point of no return but if I had your love your sweetness to guide myself through. I'm absolutely lost when I'm without you. How my heart breaks how the tears they roll. There's an empty space inside my soul but don't let the sun come down

Verse 3:
So many sleepless days and sleepless nights you know I spent alone. Girl I'm left with no one. No one to call my own. But this machine inside my head (ooh, its so cold up here) I'm hanging by your string never letting go. How my world's turned around. Almost to the ground. It's you I'm thinking of but don't let the sun come down on my love (oh oh oh)

Jamie Foxx,"Baby, you've got me going out of my mind
The thought of you has got me high, I'm so excited
I've always said I'd, I'd never fall in love
But I think I've had a change of mind

'Cause you've got me (in love)
I'm so exposed (truth is)
And heaven knows (that's why)
That if I could, I'll make the loving, girl

(If you) girl, just believe
(That I'm all) I'm all you need
Without you, no, you can't deny
Without your love, I can't survive

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
It cools me like the morning rain
(Girl you know your loving feels good)
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Even if I'm here,
For a million years
I'll never find true love, at least that's what I told
They say, it disappears, baby, after a while
I disagree because you make me smile
Girl, they just can't see your type of love is gold

(You know) girl, can't you see
(Truth is) down on my knees
(That's why) and if I could, I'll make the loving, girl

(If you) girl, can't you see
(That I'm all) I'm all you need
Don't you know, I can't deny
Without your love, I can't survive

I'm sure (I'm positive) because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

(Girl, you know I can't pretend)
I'm feeling for your tender kiss
I'm sure I've never felt a love like this
Until I tell the world, that we're in love again

Oh oh baby, come on, come on

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
It cools me like the morning rain
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't explain
'Cause you're deeper than the arex band

I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't pretend
I'm feeling for your tender kiss
I'm sure I'll never find a love like this
We can tell the whole world, that we're in love again

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain

",Your Love,1994
Jamie Foxx,"Though the times are getting wicked I'm older
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintaining, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an artist see
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it 
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next accounted by the press
Mad stress on my chest 
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best

[Chorus]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight, 
everything will be all right on any given Sunday
The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose, 
you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Strive to achieve and die for what you believe


On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded,
No defensive they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me 
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Chorus]

Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame can be as painful as
Death of patron
Young black, gifted
But I'm rapped in myself
Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars fell
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
As long as we play well they love us
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money
I know that on Any Given Sunday 
This can be taken from me 
But it all comes down to is money why'all

[Chorus x2]",Any Given Sunday,2000
Jamie Foxx,"Why do I feel like my heart gets broken
Whenever I surrender my emotions
I thought that I could tell you how I feel
Whether good or bad, when I'm happy or sad

Why do I have to be the silent one
Whenever there is something on my mind
I thought that we were partners in this game of love
Why can't I laugh or cry and shed my feelings deep inside

I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be

I'm willing to share my emotions
And give you what you need
Just don't turn away
If I say that I just want to be me, yeah

Why am I questioning where you are
It's just because I've made a few demands
Remember all the times we cried and I dried your tears
And how I held your hand if you do, please understand

I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be

I'm willing to share my emotions
And give you what you need
Just don't turn away
If I say that I just want to be me

I want to cry tears of joy and not of pain
I want to share things that words can not explain
I don't want to go, I just need for you to know
That my love is sweet, but strong, so keep on holding on

'Cause I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be

Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones

Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last

The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia

And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike

I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water

As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm.""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher

La la la la la la la la (Uh huh)
Ooh I’d lie for you baby (Ooh I’d die for you baby)
I like the way that feel

I’ll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you’ll be around
Hold me down, I’ll build you up

Listen, if you let me, I’ll be the reason you shine
It’s the secret, I want the world to know that you’re mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I’m writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I’m from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I’m special
Not rap, I mean me, that I’m special
You know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I’ll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that’s a secret

Baby, I'll build you up
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine
I need to know for sure
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine

I think about you thinkin’ that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin’ away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c’mon, let’s roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let’s go
It’s hard to measure the pleasure of havin’ you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I’ll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I’ll pick out some shit
One pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it’s more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
'Cause I know with you by my side there’s nothing I can’t do, yeah

Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up

That took place not long ago
Bout an angel up in heaven
They say she up and ran away from home

Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flea
Well you know I'm so elated
Because she's laying right here next to me

And when God woke up that morning
And he called out her name
And when she did not answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the same
Never be the same [Repeat x2]

Always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly when
All my life I'd been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never ever be
And your life don't have to be the

At times it seems we take for granted
How precious life can be
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it
Bringing into this world
A precious boy or girl
And when God woke up that morning
Said where has my little angel gone
And when she didn't an, answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the, same

Its kinda hard trying to survive, in all this crazy weather

""Son walk up right and straighten your tie
You don't want one of them good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you""

I wish you were here

I wish you were here

Or do I find comfort in all the things I got
Well these cars keep me moving
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home, but I'm barely getting by cuz
I miss our talks, One thing you used to say
When things got hard, get down on your knees and pray
And then those walks, its just the simple things
We still do all of this, But only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]

But sometimes I wonder why
Why can't you still be here with me
Wish God would've waited, a couple more years for you to see
I'm trying to stay strong, barely holding on
I know I'll see you again
But for right now rest in peace
And when I get to heaven, first thing they'll say to me
Tell me have you seen Estelle Marie Tallie
Find out where you are
Run into your arms
Wrap your wings around me, and whisper in my ear,"" Well done""

I might be doin better
It's kinda hard trying to survive
In all this crazy weather

Everybody wants my number
Everybody's callin my name
But in the midst of all of this
I can still hear you say

Son, walk upright
And straighten yo tie
You don't want one of those good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you
And now that you're gone
It still feels like you do, I Wish

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
To see the things I've done
I wish you were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish you were here
To celebrate with me
I wish you were here

Now all of these people ask me
""Is it lonely at the top?""
Or do I find comfort
In all the things I got

Well these cars keep me movin'
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home
But I'm barely gettin' by
'Cause...

I miss our talks,
One thing u used to say (used to say)
When things got hard (Hard on me)
Get down on your knees and pray

And then those walks (then those walks)
Its just the simple thangs
We still do all of this
But only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]

But sometimes I wonder why
Why cant you still be here wit me?,
Wish God would've waited a couple more years for u to see
I'm tryna stay strong
Barely holdin' on
I know I'll see you again,
But for right now, rest in peace

And when I get to heaven
First thing they'll say to me
Tell me have you seen Estelle Marie Talley
Find out where you are,
Run into your arms
Wrap yo wings around me
And whisper in my ear, well done

To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three 
You know what I'm saying? 
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

Life's up and downs, they come and go 
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky

So when I die, I hope I live in the sky

Tell God I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfucking folk 
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfucking joke
I can feel my eyes feelin' the lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'm a kill em 
I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally that's why today you not wit' me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life; it taught me that

Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep till day two
Well, that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin'

So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know ya baby mama loose, but, ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself 
Yeah, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for king, messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell them lord they all I got, so please don't take 'em from me
From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia

I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,

From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

I've been thinkin', times is hard
'Fore it get worse and fall apart
Maybe you should quit your job, and do what's right
And make you my partner for life
So we can chill (and have a little fun)
So we can chill (and have some little ones)
So we can chill (until our living's done)

Can I talk to you for a second?
There's some things I've been meanin' to tell you
Some things that have been on my mind
Listen to me baby (let's go)

Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)
Boo you know what? (What)

The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks
Sayin', anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was goin' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental

[Chorus]

C'mon, don't stop
Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)

You're so amazin'
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin'
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin' through tough times and knowin' the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin' before we lose it?
You remember, it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin', soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin', I pray to God every night we make it, pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you, c'mon

[Chorus]

Yeah I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' lately baby, yeah
Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit
I know it's hard fuckin' with a nigga like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit
Ridin' with a nigga
You know, you might as well.

[Diddy]
Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin', you know that feelin' you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl

[Chorus]

Girl, maybe we should think about it
Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady
My beautiful, so wonderful
I love you so

Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby

With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm

Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?

I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid

Sometimes its the start of a new blessing that comes in the form of a friend.
Now we all live in fear of when that day will come when memories are all we can hold.
The fire that burns is a natural love and it keeps us both warm when its cold.

Now all I wanna do is see ya laugh again and see that same joy in your eyes.
I know that your trying you just keep on smiling and everything passes with time.

When shes not around there's nowhere to go,
Make no attempts getting up out of this bed,
I'm wanna open my eyes but I just close the curtain instead,
Her thunder storms shuts my lights off oh,
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cause right now
I cant just catch a break

Everyday it rains when she ain't laying right here I
Can feel the coolness in the air I know my chances ain't far,
Everyday it rains would it be just my window seal
Sound reaches my ear go then it reappears,
Everyday it rains my heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy
The flood moves around me
Everyday it rains no sign of the light as the time
Goes by 40 days and 40 nights

Just when I thought I gotten rid of you,
I turn my face to your pillow that's soaked in your perfume,
The waters raging no life vest and I cant swim through through no,
My heart, my mind, and my soul its lost somewhere in this deep
(Not sure, her thunder storms shut my lights off oh,
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cause right now I cant get a break

Now that's contagious (oh oh) oh, that's what you are, (Luda) hey

[Ludacris]
I must admit that you are truly something special
So hop up in my vessel, let's wrestle like I'm The Rock (Rock)
Deep in your ocean I'ma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics, better that Luda wet it and get it
And have somebody call the medic (Medic!)
My head is in the right direction, my quarter's in your jukebox
Girl, you are my number one selection
I'll play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you's, and a we can break it down
To the nitty gritty one time, and when it comes to the sexing
I get busy with mine, do you get busy with yours?
I guess we destined to see, baby girl you a destine to be

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
So supernatural, wonderful and miraculous
You got me bugging off your attractiveness like whoa! (whoa!)
So precise, so fine in your position that my unanimous decision
Is to never say no (no), You got me strung like a guitar,
Playing the sweetest melody, is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon, and I never fake it, but I take it
When you get naked cause your body's like boom (boom!)
How could I resist it, I'll be there in a instant
When you call, like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'ma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screaming then Luda's up in your neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right, and all night you are (back to hook)

[Jamie Foxx]
It's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all, you put it down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's contagious how your lips make me lose composure
Addicted to the kisses your blow got me swole up
There's only one material, that's what you are to me

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ?
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Chorus]

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you

[Chorus]

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

Who's that peekin' in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
'Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attached, your love is so Wi-Fi

I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs ?light up? when they're in them shoes, oh

But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload

And cover up the tattoo by the waist

Let me find out, baby put me down, like you know I would,

Girl I know what is just you need,
And you're tired of rolling business,
'Cause you need messing with me,
Come and find out, just the reason why we're running now,
Come and find out, what's all the, what's the,

I'm no wasting your time, running my mind saying lies, to say what it's on my mind.

If you give me fifteen minutes I'll make you feel like a woman tonight,
All I need is fifteen minutes to take you on the ride of your live,
Baby, all I need is fifteen minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe,
'Cause I bet you after fifteen minutes, you need another fifteen minutes, 
Another fifteen minutes to love.

Is about to get crazy, about to go down,
Go ready for the first ride,
Hope you can handle what I get
To see the scandal what stick around, is done now,
Baby hold on to me don't let go,
Don't like shy now, promise you will be back begging for more,

You're looking back like I'm crazy
Told you to deal told you this ain't a game,
Discriminate like you're going insane.

Oooh, finally getting what you deserve,
You can even the love that's my world,
Baby, baby you can get it, you can get it,
Tell me to save the world and I ain't go kill it,

To say what it's on my mind.

Time to go in, that was just the begin,

Lets go

You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I'm so up there and so out there
Your so not here
You see we so up there and so out there
(Let me get it right here first)

I'm wakin'
Up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage and fuckin' performin'
Bustlin' in through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' misses I must have been scorin'
Speakin' of the misses
I'm watchin' 'em pourin'
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(Aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

I'm stepping out in the evenin'
Keep women screamin'
He gotta be cheatin'
But I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
No fakin' I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TV's
To screens to D-V-D's
To C-D's,
To M-P-3's overseas
I got no time to talkin' its borin'

You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

That's right,
You see the Porsche Panamera
Got em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turning corners burning rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof
I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugatti's, Maserati, new Ferrari's I've got one of each
My future bright tight like picture guy in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection to failure I'm an exception
Fuck, if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessin'
You couldn't die in the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best no auto-tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom?
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back money long as an old Cadillac
Ha ha

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball (its the King bitch!)
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner

And you wanna tell me the sky's the limit, (the sky's the limit)
When there's footprints on the moon,(the moon)
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me, I'm good (I'm good)

Half of the world don't like me (don't like me)
Half of the world wanna be me (wanna be me)
But believe me that pretty little thing they call earth
Needs me

I am here to show the world what it means to make
Something from nothing (yeah, for sure)
I am here to show the world what it is to do good business
Have glue without flow

I'm here to show the world that money don't buy
Happiness, believe me, I know (I know)
But just one thing I wanna show the world
I just wanna know

As the sun rotates and pit gets bigger
And there more countries in the world like Hitler
Commando bomb, double 0, 3, 0, 5
AKA Mr.Worldwide

Don't be silly, I've had it on lock and
That's fo'sho, (fo'sho)
I already changed my city
Now I'm on my way to change the globe (the globe)

I'm trying to inspire the world to show
What you did when you hustle and you work hard
Show'em what it is to put your life on the line
For the love of the crime

Life is a rhyme with no reason
And that's the reason I rhyme
But once I show the globe
I just wanna know

Where do we go from here?
World,tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want the world to tell me please

for an answer
In the moonlight
When I saw your face

Saw you lookin' at me, saw you peeking out from under moon beams
Through the palm trees
Swayin' in the breeze

I know, I'm feelin' so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do

Don't know how it happened, don't know why, but you don't
really need a reason
When the stars shine
Just to fall in love

Made to love each other, made to be together, for a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky

I know I'm feelin' so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I thought I could do

I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinking wrong
But inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can't catch the holy ghost in the Prius

AR don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I'ma go for both us
And put these G Star slacks with these Louie loafers
He rather sit outside and listen to Hova
But the service jumping, the pastor serving my mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus
Collection plate bulging damn pastor you the coldest

With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain't
And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
And I suppose ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole church would be on fire in here
I'm so glad we have a choir in here

Jamie Foxx,"Te juro que es verte la cara 
Y mi alma se enciende 
Y sacas al sol las pestañas 
Y el mundo florece 
Dejas caer caminando un pañuelo 
Y mi mano sin mi lo recoge 
Tienes la risa más fresca 
De todas las fuentes 

Eres el timbre del nido de mis gorriones 
Hueles a hierba y me sabes a tinta y borrones 
Eres el rayo de mayo, mis letras, tus cremas 
Cantando en el coche 
Cuando juntamos las sillas me siento tan torpe 

Me tienes guardados abrazos que abarcan ciudades 
Tienes un beso de arroz y de leche en el valle 
Y dices que vienes de Marte y vas

A regresar, vamos que te irás 
Pero es que a veces, tan solo a veces 
Lo que está siendo es lo que parece 
A veces parece que te hayas marchado ya 

Mi hembra, mi dama valiente se peina 
La trenza como las sirenas 
Y rema en la arena, si quiere 

Ay mi hembra, tus labios de menta 
Te quedan mejor con los míos 
Si ruedan mejor tu sonrisa si muerde 
Ay mi hembra 

Te acuerdas de cuando empezaron los amaneceres 
Siento que la madrugada nos hizo más fuertes 
Y luego la charla tranquila entre gotas 
Las migas hicieron su parte 
Luego se juntan las sillas
Las voces se duermen 
Y siento las lágrimas 
Caen pero no tienen nombre 
Y creo que tu confusión 
Te la quito en un baile 
En eso consiste la libertad 
En no renunciar a entregarte más 
Tú a mí me gustas tal como eres 
Si a ti te pasa lo mismo y quieres 
Nos vamos pa'lante y llegamos hasta el final

Jamie Foxx,"When visions and sick precisions awaiting at night
I guess you'll be confessing soon that you're evading me right
Hating me, right, waiting me, right
Just caught with the fire, call me a liar
On this funeral part about desire.

Seasons sighing, sighing, all predicting the end
Going for the dim martyrs, they were saying amen
Spraying and swinging with automatics, got the mics erratic
It look so static, it's all dark as an attic,
He knew without you.

No deberías aparecer ahora,
No deberías mirarme así.
No deberías hacer que te enamoras
No deberías jugar así.

Tú no deberías estar en mi persona
A veces creo que no debo
Y a veces sueño con tenerte.

If only time could go slower,
If only space could bring us closer,
If we could be more than just lovers
If you believe our love goes strong
This game is over
This game is over.

Never had to doubt you but these wounds were inflicted
Perusing them soon but recollections still restricted
My mind talks and talks, smoke, fire and brimstone
Telling me we had our fun but it's over in dim tones.

And all our sins showing in the heat of the moment
So potent till the goading get going and now it's growing
And you rolling and throttling, falling like roses,
Swollen and growing in the blast
The throne with dishonor to close up my past.

No deberías aparecer ahora,
No deberías mirarme así.
No deberías tentar a la suerte
A veces creo que no debo
Y a veces sueño con tenerte.

If we could be more than just lovers

Of pain and it won't soon forget it

We're both to blame for it, I'm sure
But tell me one thing, if another man said your name
Would it still sound poetic?
If so fuck it then, don't really wanna live
Just call the cops on me

And tell 'em I'm jumping out of the window with my heart on fire
Flying fast as the wind goes as I chase the moonlight
Love grows like a crescendo and it take me high

If so fuck it then, don't really wanna live
Just call the press on me

Glasses and pieces I'm clearing it off of your veins
How many stories have fallen, where do I begin?
The damage is done, you can tell by the cuts in my skin
Ain't no running away from all of the painful things

I see your foot on the ledge, I know that you feel the same

Jamie Grace,"Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said,
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
They see a bright new shining star,
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"".

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"".

Jamie Grace,"Looking at the radio caught up in a dream
'Bout the days gone by when no one had a TV
Hopin' that the weather man would say good things
Like no rain on Friday for the drive in movie

Little kids didn't have a care
There was love growin' up everywhere
But when I open my eyes and the dream stops playin'
You can still find me somewhere saying

I shoulda been born in forty-five
In fifty-four I woulda been nine
Lovin' my record player by my side
That woulda been nice yeah, that woulda been nice

I shoulda been born in forty-five
My first pair of high heels in fifty-nine
White shirt, poodle skirt, silk hair tie
Dancing in the moonlight that woulda been nice

Ooh, ooh
Oh that woulda been nice
Ooh, ooh

Boom box on my shoulder wit my favorite tape
I'm reppin' my eight tracks and my buckle up skates
How do I know about that you say, you say

You wear bell bottom jeans get a double take
From all the guys and the girls who look your way
Back then people didn't always agree
But the love goin' round was revolutionary and

Even though the world was crazy
I'd still go if my dreams could take me oh
I shoulda been born in sixty-five
In seventy-four I woulda been nine

Tryna' get home after playin outside
Racin' street lights, racin' street lights

I shoulda been born in sixty-five
I woulda been a teenager round seventy-nine
Teasing my hair so it looks just right
On a Saturday night, yeah that woulda been nice

Growin' up I never really had a care
There was love all the time and everywhere
And even though sometimes my world may get a little crazy
I find myself bein' proud when I say

I coulda been born in forty-five
But the truth is I got here right on time
And I thank God for every day of life
It suits me just right, it suits me just right

And lovely nineteen ninety-one
That's the year that I come from
And I wouldn't wanna trade it for another time

Two feet planted in the sand

Saw You walkin' from a distance
Without a hint of resistance
Had Your arms open

You took my hand and You whispered

With all of your friends,
And everything around you moved in slow motion,
The girls think I'm crazy,
I kinda agree,
But it's hard to be cool enough when I feel you look at me,

And I can be immature when I'm lying on the floor,
Photoshopping us together like I'm all yours,
But you just learned my name,
And I think that's kinda wack,
Have you seen my sweet shoes and my new backpack yet,

Somebody tell me why this hurts so bad,
Why can't I find some like my dad, (I love you dad)

Why can't you just see what I see,
When you say I'm just a friend, you tell me I'm just friend,
I think I could make you happy,
But you say I'm just a friend, you tell me I’m just a friend,
So I'll be that,
Oh I'll be that,
I guess that's that,
But I don't wanna be just that,

You probably think I'm too young to feel this way,
To you I'm a crush that just won't go away,
So even if you move on and have a happy life,
I promise I will pray for you, cause I'll be doing fine,

See I can try to be mature like nothing’s really wrong,
But you probably know I'm lying by the time you hear this song,
And I don't mind saying how I feel, as long as I stay true and keep it real,

Somebody tell me why love takes so long,
I think I'll just watch Reba with my mom,

Why can't you just see what I see,
When you say I'm just a friend, you tell me I'm just friend,
I think I could make you happy,
But you say I'm just a friend, you tell me I’m just a friend,
So I'll be that,
Oh I'll be that,
I guess that's that,

But I don't wanna be

You ain't gotta rush love, girl, slow down,
When you meet him you gon' know, wanna know how?
He's gonna treat you right,
Make you the queen of life,
If he don't then I'm a take ‘em out,
Psyche, all kidding aside God has the perfect,
One that was made for you, designed to worship,
God and He sees your beauty and true purpose,
So baby sis, trust the process, it's worth it,

So Father, I will place this in your hands,
(that's right)
You know me and all my crazy plans,
Humbly I surrender this to You, (all to you Lord)
So I'll keep dreaming,
You'll keep coming through,
(You keep coming through)

I know You see what I don't see,
(you see what I don't see)

I'll be just a friend,
I know that I will be happy,

Jamie Grace,"Well I was just a kid coming up those steps
All dressed up in my Sunday best
Learning to sing, learning to stand
Right in the front, holding mamma’s hand
I still remember listening to my dad
Even if I didn’t always understand
Cause deep in his heart, deep in his soul
There was a fire that I wanted to know
And those memories are still burning brightly
Oh Jesus how I love the way You’re writing my life
However could it be, to have a part in your story
Bigger than what I can see, little old me, little old me
I may not know Your plan but I’m safe here in Your hands
Cause I know that You believe, in little old me, little old me
Walking through the halls on my way to class
Caught my reflection in the trophy glass
Who was this girl, trying to be
And who in the world is she trying to please
Suddenly ignited by a spark I hear my Savior’s voice speaking right to my heart
“Don’t give up now, and don’t be afraid, you know who you are,
you got something to say”
And those memories are still burning brightly
Oh Jesus how I love the way You’re writing my life
However could it be, to have a part in Your story
Bigger than what I can see, little old me, little old me
And I may not know Your plan
But I’m safe here in Your hands
Cause I know that You believe, in little old me, little old me

But I’m still a kid in a lot of ways
