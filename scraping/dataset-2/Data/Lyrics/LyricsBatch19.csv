Carl Hayes & His Orchestra,"In a dear little village
Remote and obscure
A beautiful maiden resided
As to whether or not 
Her intentions were pure
Opinions were sharply divided
She loved to lie
Out 'neath the darkening sky
And allow the night breeze 
To entrance her
She whispered her dreams 
To the birds flying by
But seldom received any answer

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would love to stray
When it came to the end of the day
She would wander away
Unheeding
Dreaming her innocent dreams she strode
Quite unaffected by heat or cold
Frequently freckled or soaked with rain
Alice was out in the lane

Who she met there
Every day
Was a question
Answered by none
But she'd get there
And she'd stay there
'Til whatever she did
Was undoubtedly done

Over the field and along the lane
Both her parents would call in vain
Sadly, sorrowfully, they'd complain
'Alice is at it again.'

Although that dear little village
Surrounded by trees
Had neither a school, nor a college
Gentle Alice acquire
From the birds and the bees
Some exceedingly practical knowledge
The curious secrets that nature revealed
She refused to allow to upset her
But she thought
When observing the beasts of the field
That things might have been organised better

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would make up
And take up
Her stand
The road was not exactly arterial
But it led to a town nearby
Where quite a lot of masculine material
Caught her rolling eye

She was ready to hitchhike
Cadillac or motorbike
She wasn't proud or choosy
All she
Was aiming to be
Was a pinked-up
Minked-up,
Fly-by-night floozy

When old Rogers
Gave her pearls as large as
Nuts on a chestnut tree
All she'd say was
'Fiddle-di-dee!
The wages of sin will be the death of me!'

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice's parents
Would wait
Hand in hand
Her dear old white-headed mother
Wistfully sipping champagne
Said 'We've spoiled our child
Spared the rod
Open up the caviar and say ""Thank God!""
We've got no cause to complain!
Alice is at it again!'",Alice Is at It Again,1991
Carl Hayes & His Orchestra,"I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Time may lay heavy between
But what is mean
Is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh
Goodbye
I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Time has lain heavy between
But what is mean
Can leave me never
Your dear memory
Throughout my life
Will come to me
Though my world has gone awry
Though the years my tears may dry
I shall love you 'til i die
Goodbye",I'll See You Again,1991
Carl Hayes & His Orchestra,"In tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire
To tear their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules that the greatest fools obey
Because the sun is much too sultry
And one must avoid its ultra violet ray
 
Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo
Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
 
The native grieve when the white 
Men leave their huts, because
They're obviously definitely nuts!
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to
The Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindoos and Argentines sleep 
Firmly from twelve to one
But Englishmen detest a siesta
In the Philippines
There are lovely screens

To protect you from the glare
In the Malay States
There are hats like plates
Which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon
And no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete
They're quite impervious to heat
When the white man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree
 
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
 
It seems such a shame
When the English claim
The earth that they give rise to 
Such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit
Can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon
Is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down
And lie down in a jungle town

Where the sun beats down
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb
Of the English sahib
Merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok
At twelve o'clock
They foam at the mouth and run
Slut mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit
Deplores this stupid habit in Hongkong
They strike a gong and
Fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late

In the mangrove swamps
Where the python romps
There is peace from twelve till two
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze
For there's nothing else 
To do in Bengal to move 
At all is seldom, if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen,1991
Carl Hayes & His Orchestra,"Jean Louis Dominic Pierre Bouchon,
True to the breed that that bore him,
Answered the call that held in thrall
His father's heart before him.

Jean Louis Dominic sailed away
Further than love could find him
Yet through the night he heard a light
And gentle voice behind him say:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

As you gaze from afar on the evening star
Wherever you may roam
You will remember the light through the winter night
That guides you safely home.

Though you find womenkind to be frail,
One love cannot fail, my son, 
'Til our days are done....

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea.

Jean Louis Dominic Pierre Bouchon
Journeyed the wide world over
Lips that he kissed could not resist
This loving roving rover.

Jean Louis Dominic, right or wrong,
Ever pursued a new love
Till in his brain, there beat a strain
He knew to be his true love song:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot,
When you go down to the sea

For a year and a day you may sail away
And have no thought of me,
Yet through the wind and the spray you will hear me say
No love was ever free.

You will sigh when horizons are clear,
Something that is dear to me
Cannot let me be,

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot 
When you go down to the sea.

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

When there's grief in the sky and the waves ride high
My heart to yours will say
You may be sure that I'm true to my love for you
Though half the world away.

Never mind if you find other charms,
Here within my arms you'll sleep,
Sailor from the deep....

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea",Matelot,1991

Carl Hennessy,"Roll over baby, the time has come
To make a little bit more room
I've hung around you, it's getting tough
I think I'm gonna break down soon

I remember, crying in the park, it was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky
So go on and
Sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel, don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me, I'm such a mess
trying hard to find my way

Do you remember, wasting all that time, we were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line
We were alright

So go on and
Sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Oh, why'd that train just pass us by
Didn't anyone see
We were stuck at the light
Or we would've made it on time

So sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway

It's such a shame

Carl Hennessy,"When I woke up yesterday
I threw my heart down on the floor
So please be careful where you step
When you're walking out the door

Ain't it funny how time flies
I guess I must've been having fun
Only now I realize that I was the only one
So I say

Hey you, asleep in my room
Something tells me you'll be waking up soon
And why'd you dance on my floor
Now I can dance no more
Hey you, love of my life
Is no one's safe from goodbye

Hey-hey, so you were the one
Forgot to tell me why at all
You said you'd always be my angel
But even angels fall
Why you now

Hey you, asleep in my room
Something tells me you'll be waking up soon
And why'd you dance on my floor
Now I can dance no more
Hey you, love of my life
Is no one's safe from goodbye

I was in love with you
You stabbed my heart
I don't forgive you

Hey you, asleep in my room
Something tells me you'll be waking up soon
And why'd you dance on my floor
Now I can dance no more
Hey you, love of my life
Is no one's safe from goodbye

Ain't it funny how time flies
I guess I must've been having fun

Carl Henry,"Just the other night, 
I saw those eyes, that face.
In the middle of my dreams.
She was by your side 5'5 big thighs nice frame
Now she's next to me.

Now I can't even front like I'm feeling another,
I'm talking keys to the crib it's your mother,
I'm talking first class trips with each other,
I can't let you get away no.

Just wanna please ya
Uh oh, oh oh
I'm thinking bout spending chips on cribs and shit for you.

You really like the type,
So fly, but you shy to say(that you really feel me too)
Girl ain't men like I don't come around everyday,
And all your girls are still with you.

Now I can't even front like I'm feeling another
I'm talking cribs and a lake for the summer.
I'm talking you calling me baby father
I can't let you get away no!

[Chorus]

Oh what you say what you say what you say are you living with me
Oh anything anything that you say baby that's what I'll be.

Hey, look a-yonder comin', comin' down that railroad track

Carl Jackson,"Tonight the rain that's falling
Only adds to my heartache
It runs quietly down my window
Like the tears upon my face
And each time the lightning flashes
And I hear the thunder roar
I'm reminded of the closing of the door

I'm not over you
The storm still rages
The waves of pain remind me
That we're through
I'm slowly drowning
In a sea of endless heartbreak
I'm going under
'Cause I'm not over you

I keep holding to your memory
But my hopes are sinking fast
The chance that you'll come back to me
Now fades into the past
Can I find a way to let you go
Somewhere down deep inside
By reaching for the healing hands of time

I'm not over you

The waves of pain remind me
That we're through

Carl Jackson,"I hear a lonesome dove off in the distance
His cry echoes out through the hills
He's sad that his lover flew off with another
And I know the sorrow he feels

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

I've tried to run from the pain of his memory
But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
No matter how far he flies

You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

Carl Jackson,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Carl Jackson,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

(Unless she's got a perfect personality)

(A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair)
(Or even just a bit bowed at the knee)

Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?

Carl Mann,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

I can't remember when I've ever been so blue
If I ever needed love, I need it now
I feel so all alone I don't know what to do

I feel like I could die from wanting you
I can't ease my aching heart, but you'd know how
If I ever needed you I need you now

Carl Mann,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see

I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1978
Carl McGinley,"Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me, occupy my brain?

Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family get down!
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale

Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

Want for nothing, but is nothing what you need

All day long I stand and watch you do it wrong
I have to say that's how you did it all along

And someone showed you, then why was it always me

Carl Peberdy,"Well on the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot
Dan dropped in about five o'clock
Pulled off his coat, said ""The night is short.""
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart

And hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan got happy and he started raving
He jerked out his razor, but he wasn't shaving
And all the cats knew to jump and hop,
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried.""

The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
They all ran in to see what it was about
And I heard him holler when they led him away
He turned his head, and this is what he had to say

Hollered, ""Rave on children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
He let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
And through the black crossed bar he tossed a note to his dig
It said ""It ain't my fault, hun, that I'm in here""

But hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you!

Well my daddy left home when I was three
Didn't leave much to my mom and me
Except this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that my daddy ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

He must've thought that it was quite a joke
And I got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
Seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd turn red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keener
Roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man that gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
Thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran col
And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?
Now you gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
Then I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the walls and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""now you just fought one heck of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But y ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue""

What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
I called him my pa, and he called me his son
Come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were

Carl Perkins,"Well on the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot
Dan dropped in about five o'clock
Pulled off his coat, said ""The night is short.""
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart

And hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan got happy and he started raving
He jerked out his razor, but he wasn't shaving
And all the cats knew to jump and hop,
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried.""

The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
They all ran in to see what it was about
And I heard him holler when they led him away
He turned his head, and this is what he had to say

Hollered, ""Rave on children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried""

Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
He let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
And through the black crossed bar he tossed a note to his dig
It said ""It ain't my fault, hun, that I'm in here""

But hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried

The cats go wild, do a boogie that's hot
My boogie woogie makes you want to stop and do the bop
It's called the Lewis boogie, in the Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie woogie every day

Aw,
Oh, boy!

Well, now let's cruise on down to old Memphis town
That's where that Presley boy said you ain't nothing but a hound
But now you take my boogie, it keeps you in the groove
Then your sacroiliac begins to shiver and a move
It's called the Lewis boogie, in the Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie woogie every day

Oh, boogie woogie
When your hips start rockin'
And your knees start knockin'
Lewis boogie, Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie woogie every day",Lewis Boogie,1998

We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove

Where the willow grew

Where the silver leaf of maple
Sparkled in the morning dew
I braided twigs of willows
Made a string of buckeye beads

And you're the one I need

And you're the one I need

And I breathed the honey dew

Against a sky of baby blue
Beside the lily pads
I carved a whistle from a reed

And you're the one I need

And you're the one I need.

Would wither and would die

Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, 
Well then they gotta get off the Bible train.

But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.

And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right

He stopped once to wipe the sweat away

Sitting 'til the sun goes down
In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round

And I can't get it out of my head

Carl Saunders,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2000
Carl Saunders,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks,2000
Carl Saunders,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Carl Schroeder,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable

Are you smart?

We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart

What a shame that it's gone

Don't you hear the bells now ringing can't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river

You're not havin' any fun then maybe you're out with the wrong one

Beneath the stars all alone

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know

And she thought ""I wonder how on earth

In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy-child feeding at her breast

""Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin""
""I've seen some sights but, babe, you're somethin'""
""Mama loves her country bumpkin""

The raptured wonder from the woman's face

Carl Smith Trio,"When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...
[ guitar ]
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...

Carl Smith Trio,"There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach at shore by fate's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals there to dwell with the immortals
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing can't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

When our days shall know the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
Never more with anguish laden we shall reach at lovely aden
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing",When They Ring Those Golden Bells,1957
Carl Smith Trio,"A friend of mine came up to me and he said if I could see
All the mighty works of Christ down here below
When he said I could believe and my doubts he could releave
Cause I'm the kind of guy that's got to know
I was taken by surprise and I looked into his eyes
For I thought that he could see as well as I
I said my friend just let me show you what the Master left below
And by fate you surely see if you try
Cause everytime the roses bud and everytime the rivers flood
Then I know I seen the works of the Lord
Everytime a robin flies or a newborn baby cries
Then I know I seen the works of the Lord

Cause everytime the roses bud",Works of the Lord,1957
Carl Stephenson,"Everything that ever was

Algorithm of perfect bliss
Algorithm of consciousness

I see a shadow of reality

Carl Stephenson,"I fall in the water that swells at my feet
fighting the current rushing by me
clinging to fishes looking for guides
I ponder the questions
that wrack me inside
that asking all questions
might push you away
and questioning answers
that wither and fray

Packaging packages pack it away

Without believing, cauldron seething
tumult crushes the rock of reason
the more I have, the less I want
the broken wings that are the hunt

river down the stream of I

One more inspired moment
meets me on the way
down to the source
we know is all ending

Smooth notes are grit
Sparkle and shimmer
While flowing the river
Down the stream of I

All the rest is created by mind
It seems there is something

Non-existence does not exist
I'm trying to explain the essence of being
to get a realization of what I consist

You may think it absurd to make a
theory of reality
when reality is relative
to the mind that occurs
but since the mind that occurs is of the
same species
the genus homo
then I'm talking to you

There's an infinite parallel theory that
the universe splits
into innumerable copies of itself at
every moment
There's a superstring theory that there
are ten dimensions
six of which are so small we never see
It's possible that everything that exists
equals nothing
It just popped into existence through a
quantum fluctuation
and I think it's important that you
consider the fact
that the mind may be a mathematical

You know the family is the solution to the world's problems today
Now let's take a look at the family
In the family the father is like the head, the leader, the director
Not domineering, but showing love, guidance
For everyone else in the family
Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
There's supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not
'Cause you'll bleed

Wherever you go I'll follow

True blue girl
Who wants to know
Can you come out and play
You make me feel the way

The chill in your fall

Carl the Intern,"Perry the Platypus
Is a lovely shade of teal
From his duck-billed nose to his web-bed toes
And his nerves were made of steel

What does this have to do with Christmas?
Well, I'm, I'm just describing him
So that people have a mental picture
It, it matches the original song

The night before Christmas
'Twas a crisis at the Pole
'Cause old Doofenshmirtz, he had done his worst
And a sleigh that day he stole

Doof took it on a joyride
Just as far as he was able
But Doof, that goof, he lost control
Ran into the reindeers' stable

Now all the reindeer
Were on crutches or in traction
So old agent P, he knew that he
Must spring right into action

Look at that platypus, look at that platypus
Look at that platypus go
Look at that platypus, look at that platypus
Flying o'er the snow

""O'er,"" sir?
It's a contraction, it means ""over""
It's a bit archaic
It's traditional, Carl, get o'er it

So the reindeer were out of commission
And Santa's sleigh was trashed
I'd explain it more but we've been there before
It doesn't need to be rehashed

Santa Claus was freaking out
Thought he'd have to scrap his run
He was torn inside, for without a ride
He knew Christmas Day was done

But then o'er the horizon
Came a light bright as a star
Cutting through the night was the two headlights
Of Perry's hover-car

Perry the Platypus
Had a mission at the Pole
If he could lend a hand in that frozen land
He'd help Santa reach his goal

There must have been some magic in
That platypus-themed hover-car
For when Santa saw the gas gauge
He knew it could take him far

Really, sir?
They want this album yesterday, all right?

Perry the Platypus
Took Santa on his way
And he came through like we knew he'd do
And saved our Christmas Day","Frosty the Snowman [Recorded as ""Perry Saves Christmas""]",2010

Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin' that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintin', because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

[Styles]
When I was nine years old,
I realized there was a road.
At the end, I would win lots of pots of gold.
Days, when I used to have my play clothes on,
I would make up my rhymes the middle of Voltron,
But you've learned what the herbs do.
Breaking curfew,
Hit the park when it's dark, make it stand like a podium.
Niggas had a box and a strip of linoleum.
Some break a boogie, but those that don't 
Was usually a fighter.
Rollin' easy riders,
Sending people to the store for a soda and a lighter.
A real cool cat that would let you keep a dollar,
But now things change, and it's the days of tomorrow.
Little kids is big now,
They'll push your wig now.
Can't send them to the store,
But you can send them for roll
And put them on my vine,
And give them one big push for all mankind.

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss] 
People still taking rapping for a joke,
A passing hope,
Or a phrase with a rope.
What ever happened to the caddies, white walls, and spokes? 
Crates of records, turn tables, plenty of folks,
Remember playing in the streets, touch football.
Look, y'all,
Somebody get mad and bounce with they football.
Twenty four hour block parties,
Everybody on the block pissing, you a dark hardy.
Adults used to think I was scheming,
But I was dreaming to one day make a hot album and have 'em all fiendin'.
Now, every time, that I rhyme I can tell that you like it,
Be nursing the tunes like the mind of a psychic.
Your mind is weary, floating like a dove,
Sweating and things, like you were making love.
Control the crowd so they can accept it.
Total concentration is the perfect method.

[Bridge:]
Where's the love? 
Somebody tell me,
Where's the love? 
Because we want to know.

(Puff) 
I remember everybody I loved, everybody.
It wasn't always player hating,
There wasn't jealousy and all this envy,
It was the love.

[Sheek]
Hey yo, hip hop 
Set out in the park.
What? 
We used to do it out in the dark
All night long till the cops made us go,
Or till somebody's moms pulled the extension cord from the window.
Lees on, thinking you fresh,
Trying to impress
Shorty, with the baby hair pushed down on her forehead.
Ponytail swaying, she hot,
Standing like she bowl-legged, but she not.
You remember the days? 
That's when crack was affecting blacks like that.
Just drink some Valentine Ale, little reefer,
Friday night go check out Star Child at the theater.
That's all corrupt.
Over rap you might get bust.
Say the wrong thing:
End up in a permanent sling.
Went from shell tops to hollow tops.
Used to rock the bus stop.
Now we electric slide from the cops.
Want some veterans in this,
That ain't keeping it real.
Now, with God, we chill over a record deal.
Always the good ones to go,
Never your enemies die.
Till this day, I wonder why they took my man B.I.
No time to yell rhymes in the microphone.
Take this more serious than just a poem.
Rock party to party
While you're out the door.
But tear it up, yo, let's start love over.

[Chorus]

[Bridge: x2]",Let's Start Rap Over,1998
Carl Thomas,"Yo I grew up like the regular thug sold drugs 
Wasn't proud about it, but this is what I gotta do 
I copped the Jordan's, and the Fila's, too 
Yo, I loved the Bo Jackson's, the orange and blue 
Used to snatch Lee patches, now I wear Cartier glasses 
Thinkin' that the earth's axis, 
Revolves around my waist.. and how the fuck I feel 
Yo I played ball for Vince, yo I handled the pill 
Then it dawned on me, came strong on me 
I belonged with these, niggaz thuggin' with me 
So I switched crews, started rollin' with the older dudes 
Drinkin' brews, did what they say, and paid dues 
My hands dirty, trying to keep little Lea 
And got jerked, the first time I tried to re-up 
People my age, tried to say slow my speed up 
'Cause I smoked bogies, staked on weed up 

[Chorus]
I love my life (Love my life, yo) 
Sold drugs my life (Did it all in my time) 
Its my whole life (Live it up) 
I sacrificed (Sacrificed twice) 
This game we play (Play for keeps) 
I live and pray (Control the streets) 
Hear her say (Yo, just live your life, baby, live your life,baby) 
Ooo, yeah 

These is the days of sparkin', I used to roll with Rob Profit 
Troy Outlaw, Freddie Bedrock, and Joe Wood 
Runni'n in Timbo's ???, shine shoes 
Section Two, part of Iraq I grew up at 
Had to learn how to slapbox, instead of a gat 
I never knew rap, all I knew was crack 
Yo there's rules to this game, and people to blame 
When you see another little brother doing the same 
As you used to 
Growing up like you 
Palyin' skully, with his heat out, cellular phone 
Getting little drug money, but got the world sewn 
I recall, cause he gonna die 
Yo, I cry 
It's hard to, get tarred up with God jewel, part two 
Smily got shot up to (Rest in peace) 
Aiyyo, you realize that you miss a nigga (miss him) 
When you realize (realize) that you never gonna see him again 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo, its totally, up to the team, to me 
So don't, make a move if you don't ask me 
I'm, casually known, halfly blown 
In Miami, cause now Uncle Wise came home 
Jello, copped me a Role', copped them one, too 
You keep it real with a person, keep it real with you 
Use confidence, Thugged Out aimed for dominance 
Nostradam' in this, he slits wrists just like Glomerus 
??, Grenad', iced out for Tito 
Puerto Rico, we live life now cause we know 
The other side of the fence stay friendly 
Its just war in there, done, there ain't no Henny 
I can't live that, déjà vu, I did that 
I gained stats, rumblin' cats over Kit Kats 
Now I spit raps, park my Benz where the chicks at 
And just live with a big stack 

[Chorus: x3]",I Love My Life,1998
Carl Thomas,"Yo yo 
What what 
want to bounce? 
Come on come on 
What what 
Bounce bounce 
Check it out y'all 

Yo you see the Benz I'm in with BBS rims 
Playing Lil' Kim's part off The Benjamins 
I ain't a player I just wear Tims 
No need for gators my feet can't swim 
I'm in Reno Nevada sippin' a pena colada 
How many niggas can see Montanna? 
This movie's killin' and budgin' 
Women love me in polo jeans and rugbys 
You can hate it or love it, imiatate it or dub it 
Compared to us, niggas ain't nuttin' 
It's funny how niggas get paid for frontin' 
Glorifying crimes, and they ain't done 'em 
My rhymes'll split 'em like pimpin', Dom P sippin' 
I'm not a baller, haven't even lived it 
Women callin', since my days in the crib crawlin' 
I plan to live enormous 
I live nike dunks, icey chunks 
A fly wifey I can trust 
Not that she gon' want to hesit me for re-up 
I might be, Iron Mike if you try to entice me 
I say this politely, tell it to a friend 
Hard from the start, get money to the end 
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? 
Leanin' in the BM with the rim's gleamin' 

[Chorus] 
Mega gonna hold his own 
He always knew he could do it alone 
And when he rhymes 
Everybody's gonna know 

Yo, I write rhymes for the flyest whips, finest chicks 
And any rappin' nigga that thinks he's as nice as this 
See me chillin' in clubs with women and thugs 
Whoever want to test this, we fill 'em with slugs 
My jewlery gliestenin', rhymes usually sickenin' 
Game like Fab 5 at Michigan, you listening? 
Pimps, I bust 'em, niggas, don't trust 'em 
Snitches, don't want 'em in my shit 
We in a tunnel, buyin' mo' by the bundle 
You know when we come through, get it right 
But dead? right, techs spit nice 
I know where you read my man was jessying your wife 
I suggest you chill unless you ill enough to test the skill 
That I possess niggas, for real 
I'm the last of the mohecans, rhyme ill flow lethal 
Due to magazines, there's no equal 
No sequel to my flow evil, deletin' your people 
We through seein' time, you're see-through 
Nas off the meter, rhyme for the Beamers 
Roll wit' overacheivers, my people, my people from madenas 
Where you at dime-peices, fly features? 
Lookin' so right my man is dying to meet ya 
I know your baby dad just buying you sneakers 
But I'm a keep it real, I ain't cheap 
Check it out 

[Chorus] 
Yo, to the haters, lovers, thug baby mommys 
Walk around me tryin' to play stuck-up 
See me in a ride and want to say ""what's up?"" 
I put my foot and the gas and tell they ass ""tough luck"" 
I don't start beef, I finish it 
My enemies hearts diminishin' 
Before a rapper had dough, you didn't 
You a pathetic nigga, first it was Biggie and Pac 
Now you jealous of Jigga 
You like a breast implant, fake on the inside 
You nice, let's battle for dough Mr. Big-Time 
On Hot 97, or live at Envy's 
I can ass-bend you and still leave with 10 g's 
Too real for you, what you dream I live and breath 
Whoever want to intervene, come on, get your team 
And I'm a show you who the illest 
'Cause everybody know who the realest 
Now feel it

Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thingy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, tryin' to eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, you fool!
Cause I am so cool

A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the be	-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust them heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks ?N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool

Carl Thomas,"Sometimes I don't think you motherfuckers 
Understand where I'm coming from
Where I'm tryin' to get to
Sometimes I hear voices
I can't see it, can you see it?
Turn the lights on
Check this out

Make money's the motto, staying desparados
New chance of hitting the lotto
Let's take it to the neck wit this bottle
Get in the Eldorado
And break from this bitch at full throttle
You like fuckin' fashion models? 
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles
And leave a nigga hurting on the block 
Sounding like when you gargle
Them hero niggas that plot
Them zero niggas get got 
And never get a chance to bust shot
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot
Then I'm on the run wit a gun smoking hot
All around the world's where I go
Places that only I know
Goodfella not gunshotto
And I'm tellin' niggas, make money's the motto
Fuck the niggas that squable 
And I hit them back and fourteen hollow, take that

I hear voices inside
And I see crime, don't die
And I need changes 
Oh, please, please, please
Don't go Don't go

I'm just trying to get my money, right
Don't fuck wit my money
I won't fuck wit your money
If you fuck with my money
I make you like one of them presidents
Feel me?

Representing my money for the love of my money
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy
Now don't miss it, if I catch them coming for me 
When I try to tell a dummy
You took it like I was saying something funny
Took it like my word wasn't shit, like I wasn't legit' 
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget 
That's something I'll never permit
When I feel my eye twitch things happen 
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch
Trying to keep things low-low
They don't really know, though
Bad Boy the motherfuckin' logo
Stay on your toes 
They shouldn't get it mistaken
Hope they don't think I'm faking
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken
You know the rule of thumb be 
Don't try to take nothing from me
I rule it wit a street stay slummy
Make money's the motto, fuck the niggas that squabble
I know I might be hard for you to swallow
Ya feel me?

I hear voices inside
And I see crime, don't die
And I need changes 
Oh, please, please, please
Don't go Don't go

Sometimes I just feel like y'all don't understand
Where I'm coming from, where I'm trying to get to
Shit is really deep, my shit is deep

They don't have a direct understanding of me
Fuck what they planning for me
I just won't accept the bullshit that they handing me
Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me
And all that negative shit pertaining to me
What ya think I claiming to be
A straight heart staying with me 
I can tell it's about to go down
I told them, slow down before I send the low down
And skip out of town
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta
The situation is serious and getting hotter
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver
Like I told them, just to let him know 'til' he figures out 
It's make money's the motto
Something ya'll should follow
And I don't got no time for the squabble
Ya feel me?

I hear voices inside
And I see crime, don't die
And I need changes 
Oh, please, please, please
Don't go Don't go

Sometimes you just get tired of shit
Sometimes you just get fed up
Don't hate me, hate yourself, motherfuckers
Don't hate me,  hate yourself
Cause I ain't never gonna stop
I ain't never gonna stop
I'll make you feel me forever
And ever and ever and ever

That's just the way it's gonna be",I Hear Voices,1999
Carl Thomas,"(Verse One)

Yo had me in the LQ
Yo shit was mad bumpin 
Rappers on the mic was like settin off somethin
Now parties like this yo god 
I like lougin observin everything inside my surrounding
Jasmine dancin wit this non-descrip sucka
Okay cool as long as the sucka don't touch her 
Nigga
Get the urge and can't control his hand
Get a body bag cause ""mauh"" he's a dead man
She was coolin sportin my table 
When the dance was done she like walked back to money's table
I sat there like shit I can't believe this
I wish you was there big fella so you could see this bitch
Sittin there boo legs wide open laughin gigglin smilin and jokin wit homes
Like they use to hang out real real tough
He musta had a strong rap cause Jasmine looked gased up
Sittin there played the role of a slouch
Just watchin to see how Jasmine played herself out
They sat there just talkin to each other 
I thought this kid was alone he had five more brothas wit him
Wit out girl's night ain't this some shit 
If she don't recognize the game they can kiss this shit
They introduced theyselves one at a time
Saw 'em say how you doin so Jasmine say ""fine""
I was laughin but there was more in store
I saw her get up and start walkin towards the front door
I rolls too god and walked right behind em
So where ever they go it won't be hard to find em
I keep a guard you now I thought I better
Plus I keep the stash deep inside the 8 pound leather
Open doors vale was on the ready 
At the end Jasmine is gonna wish she never met me
We're off two cars speedin deep in the night
I'm doin 30 on the straight away 60 on the turnpike
For Jasmine

(Chorus)
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh
Playa freeze while I pull out my nine
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh

(Verse Two)

Word up ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still chasin them suckas in the '86 Jetta
Thinkin different thoughts still not understandin 
How 7 people got in that fuckin Volkswagen
Enough of that god yo back to the chase
Yo man you should've seen the ruckus look on my face
Slowin down cruisin on the cool out mode
Then parked in front of his house on Gunhill road
Man I started to get out
Grabbed the rope and try to hang her
Before I let this posse drop shots gang bang her
They went inside man but I kept goin
Parked across the street wit out them even knowin
Got out the car still schemin the house
Tip toed around the back quiet like a church mouse
If the neighbors looked out the window 
They would surely get leerly and scream like ""BAHANDO""
Police they would hold my fate
But they didn't so I creeped up the fire escape
I saw shadow's inside a bright lit room
Which appear to be two bodies dancin to a slow song nigga
I got closer decided I should check it
I saw Jasmine and one of them kids dancin buck naked
So I got the gat so I have no interference 
When I make my grand appearance
For Jasmine

(Chorus)


(Verse Three)

I seen a red dot tryna lock on me
I can't believe these niggas tryna pull a pac on me
I admit they had the drop on me 
Probably turned the burner around 20 degrees 
So I could see 
Who bust me 
Who knocked me out 
Who tried to choak 
Who tied the rope
Who left  me this bitch ass note
I'm disgusted the murder she wrote
Money she oaked all of my coke all of dope
Up in smoke
Made you follow me probably so mad you want to hollow me
But you won't be so lucky today so swallow me
Got your GS4 and your Bently rose took all of your clothes
And 99 bottles of Mo's 
What she didn't know is about the dynamite in the rose
And if I get close I'll blow her cause I got the controls
At the toll on the phone wit this bitch Nicole
Said she left you in some  hotel out in the road
Room 112 penthouse sweet alumni
On the 12th floor in front of her door was one guy
On some Brandon Lee shit he wasn't handin me shit
Understand me he flipped bust the 9 and he split
Had my heat cocked busted right through the sheet rock
How'd he drop he ain't the nigga I just shot
Whas goin on all of a sudden it was nothin no jokin son 
Jasmine holdin the smokin gun
By the time I realized I caught two in the chest had the vest
As I fell I'm not thinkin of death
Still fallin to a place wit more conscience though
Long enough to see her aim and put one in her throat
So I got up all shot up grabbed the Prada
Faggots probably towed my truck
You know how my luck 
Hoped in bleedin to death turned left 
Thought of Jasmine and how she went out to the death
For Jasmine

You know what? it's hella lonely at the top when you rich without a girl
It's me against the world, but that's how my world twirl
So let that shit spin cause I'ma play it to the end
Sometime you gotta make decisions: your woman or your friends?
My friends come first
My females is secondary
The last girl I had was this bad ass secretary
Her name was yvonne - that bitch thought she was the bomb
But I knew it wouldn't work, I never took her home to moms
You know havin a ball not givin my all
Holdin hands down the hall at the crenshaw mall
She used to look at me and saw no flaws at all
We was close - she walked around my house in her draws
But after all the good times you know comes the rain
I had to cut that bitch off for some shit I can't explain
I blamed it on her trip and she blamed it on my fame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

[carl thomas]
Ohh the game owes nothin to nobody
So I'm tellin you this from the start
If you find you've been deceived by another
Then you better just trust in your heart

[tash]
So all the ladies wave your hands if you down wit your man
I know them two kids you got wasn't part of the plan
What this world is a twist; if it ain't that it's this
I like the kinda girl that tatoo niggaz names on they wrist
Tash on your tit
That's the kinda girl I need
After work, feeds her seeds then smokes a little weed
Low key; that's how my girl gon' be
But I ain't found her yet and she ain't found me
So I'm lookin
For all the sexy hoes that ain't tooken
Carl put me down with this bad broad from brooklyn
But all I do is hit - no spark, no flame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

Chorus

[tash]
I know this love song I'm writin ain't flashin your excitement
But when you least expect it love will strike you like some lightning
That's why I'm here to warn ya
These girls in california, they'll take you to the cleaners
If you let 'em put it on ya (put what? )
You know the little wifey deluxe
That'll have your friends and family rentin a tux
That's why you gotta keep it p.i.
So even if your buck stop
You got the type of girl that'll walk you to the bus stop
True love-
That's kinda hard to find when you rhyme
I'm 27 now and it's 1999
But I'ma find mine; matter fact, what's yo name?
-trust in yo heart- but that's a part of the game

[Raekwon]
Yo, it started out in East NewYork
Where I grew up, learned how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers

Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy

Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
Yup, that's ya Pops

Still, that's me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal 
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out

Three days away from home he come back stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big

Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
To God I pleaded

What should I do? knock your self off, but the God succeeded
And the most scariest part is you better have heart
'Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Have Faith in your God

Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black Clarion, ready to die for the family hard

Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather sleek Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit

Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society's grown too black and too strong to prolong
Got my Woman with a gun in her thong

It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil's force has risen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders

That's real, 'cause we need them and they need us, that's love for ya
Leavin' on this moment
Meditatin' at Four in the Mornin'
Nigga you screamin'.....
 
[Chorus]
I got hustlin' on my mind otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car, at the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

[Madd Rapper]
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter

My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it

Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx

Knowin' all along the shit was wrong 
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last, 
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left

Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches, 
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps

I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood. 

[Chorus]

I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto

This goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all
Around the nation and all around the World, know what I'm sayin'?

Carl Thomas,"Yo, ever since I known you, you been out to get me
Acting like my peeps, but I know that's how you tricked me
Love to see me get high, love to see my tipsy
Heard you even wanna stick a little chip in me
You been trying to play me close ever since my shine
Wanna take me to dinner, feed me shrimp and swine
You said, ""Amil I want you to meet a good friend of mine
His name is Money and we partners till the end of time""
Introduced me to your clique, hate, envy, lust and greed
Said you want the whole world in ya custody
And if I give you my soul you'll give me luxuries
Said you could hit me up wit power, it's just up to me
I turn you on when I'm in short skirts and tight jeans
You want my kids to write Santa and celebrate Halloween
Told me sell my people crack and get rich off fens
You love the number six but hate the number thirteen

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

You wanna, be the one to pick me up when I fall
Told me hang Casear bojease on my living room wall
It was always something bout you that made my skin crawl
You turned me into a player and showed me how to ball
You give me rewards when I rob and steal
Want me to abort my babies and get on the pill
You put burners in the hood so each other we kill
I see your eye watching me on the dollar bills
When I got the scoop on you, it just made you mad
Cause I moved out your crib, packed all my bags
Them days I turned to you was the days you laughed
You used to smile every time I pledge allegiance to the flag
We speak now and then but we ain't smacking hands
You be up in the clubs asking me for a dance
Still trying to convince me to go cheat on my man
Begging me to please give you just one more chance

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

When we was kids you was the one who taught me how to lie
Said I could always use you as my alibi
And you kept me from knowledge, wisdom, and the most high
Had me believe God had blonde hair and blue eyes
Our relationship went sour since I found the truth
You know you can't have me so you fuck with my youth
You got all my phones tapped, I gotta talk at booths
I learned an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You built Sodom and Gomorra for us all to live in
When we was cool you used to tell me all your visions
Like how you gonna rule the nations under one religion
You got this New World order, it's like a big prison
You said you wanna be worshipped from noon to noon
Nothings gonna get better is what we all assumed
Cause nights is getting shorter and it's snowing in June
I see you working overtime cause you out of here soon

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

Carl Thomas,"Baby, for every time that you felt love was taken for granted
And I didn't care
Well, these are just a few words
To let you know how I feel
Hey, yeah
(Let me be the first to let you know)

Oh, I had an awful dream
That you were needing someone else's love to take the place of mine
So I over came the distance
That challenged my persistence
I let my ego go and drowned my pride
And you ask why

You're such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know
Such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know

One more thing I need to say
Is that I need you every day
It's not the same 'till you come back to me
Girl I've loved you from conception
So if you follow my direction
I'll lead you where you always need to be
Right next to me, oh

You're such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know
Such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know

Let me be the first to let you know
I appreciate the things you do for me
When you're loving me at night
Let me be the first to let it show
I'd show the way to go
'Cause every waking move is oh so right

You're such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know
Such a special lady
Though I haven't told you lately
So let me be the first to let you know",Special Lady,2000

She keeps me home
Quiet conversation makes me warm
So

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

In the middle of the night when I'm alone
I feel her kisses on me even when she's gone
Can't wait 'till she gets home

You're a star
That's what you are
Something wonderful
I gotta let you know
You mean the world
'Cause you're my girl
Shine like a supastar
To me that's what you are

You must have been there waiting all the while
While I played the field just like an anxious child
Oh when I heard one day you would come to me
Now here we are, baby you set me free

How sweet it's been since you've been loving me
First we were friends and now we're family
But what the future holds, just don't know
But I'll be OK, long as there's you to hold

Carl Thomas,"But I'm sayin'
Here I am, say lying and praying
That I'm laying something hot
'Cause baby, it's cold outside
And even when it's not, it still is

Baby shorties ask me what the deal is
Not listenin' to they mom and them
'Cause they all know what they talkin' 'bout, like Willis
I say what shorty desire, be what real is
And when I first came to her
I was still wet behind the ears
So I was just the lame to her
I heard older cats lay claim to her
And say they speak game to her
But they never put a name to her

So I called her desire
Like so many street cars that I did for
For her promises, little brothers, there bids for
And little sisters sacrifice they head for
Even street-wise vets wind up dead for
See she will attempt to straight pimp you
You'll scream ""Fuck the world""
But soon go them too

She proclaim that my esteem was way off the rack
I had style but it was the Caddy I lack
The gangsta white walls and the diamond in the back
I asked her was she white or black
She said neither one, or somewhere in between
Plus she was mean and had been seen
In places where cats got big faces
Has made some trade in freestyles for freebases

I knew that my best friend was meddling
But I continued peddling
But I got arrested before I got rich
Trying to make some scratch
Like trigger fingers that itch
She told me she call me an ambulance
If I ever called her a bitch

(I'm so glad)
Alright, I tried to be online
(Trouble don't last)
But the matrix had a major glitch
(Always)
She said my style could never switch
I was her nigger for life
(Always)
She said her peeps
Probably couldn't pronounce Malik Yusef
But they could pronounce us man and wife
(I'm so glad)
So the script I attempted to flip, flop

Flip floppin' to backwards, know

All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I shoulda known one day that you'd be gone
You shoulda known one day that I'd be gone
You shoulda known one day that we'd be

Why did you have to be this way
Baby all you had to say
Was that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be
But you planned a great escape
Bright and early before I wake
We both knew we had to break
You coulda chose a better way

Woke up in the morning, you were not there

In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I shoulda known one day that you'd be gone
You shoulda known one day that I'd be gone
You shoulda known one day that we'd be

It was cold the way you left
Still the pain is in my chest
Because in my heart I felt you shoulda came and talked to me
If you put away your pride
And look deep into my eyes
It woulda been to your surprise
That I got up to apologize
But you were gone

Woke up in the morning, you were not there

Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone
It's time to carry on
I thought that you made me happy
But it's this thing that's come between us girl
At one time you were my world
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away

Carl Thomas,"I'm working hard
50 hours a week paying for the car
And the house we had built on the boulevard
And as soon as you get home you want to start
With something negative
Besides physical harm, what do you give
And you make lots of noise for someone who sits
At home all day watching One Life To Live

You ain't right, no, no
I thought you loved me
You ain't right, no, no

We're suppose to be a team
At least you could do things like cook and clean
But I ask you what's up, you start looking mean
Smackin' your lips like you're still a teenager
And I'm sick of this, but I end up in this predicament
I would rather go somewhere and pitch a tent
Then to stay here with you acting ignorant

You ain't right, no, no
I thought you loved me
You ain't right, no, no

You shouldn't take for granted my love
'cause one day it could be gone
Taking the best of me and my love
I gave to you and you gave me none

Carl Thomas,"I'ma give all why y'all something, word up
Word up, all my live cats out there gonna love me for this one
They goin' be like,
""Yo you, you need to listen to that joint L made""
Word up
That's the joint you gotta listen to, why know what I mean?
Check this out why y'all

I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind be	
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
Cause he beefing when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wasting time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggas feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like,
""see man baby, you should be honored to share me""
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em coming, you niggas feel me?
Baby or no baby I wasn't loyal or nothing
Just me and my niggas on tour, fronting and hitting something
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you want to be an actress huh? Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons and Dragons, getting brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans sagging, crew laughing
Getting blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nothing but the dog in me needing to be released
This is us

[Chorus]
You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

The flip side of the coin, what team you want to join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposing your tenderloins
In every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubbling crazy, want to flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
To put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
And skip that ""Bills Bills"" shit broads is goin' through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashing gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
So he can say, ""No L live here,"" our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plotting and scheming in the shower, masturbating on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
But the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
Like the devil's pumping hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us

[Chorus]

They say a man goin' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you giving him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, ""Nigga where you go?""
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's raining outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
Wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
From me all night freaking, with a nineteen year-old
Half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leaking
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killing me
I don't always want to talk about how the world is shitting on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I want to be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
Complain about, who's trading ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feeling that
Think about that shit, word up

[Chorus]

Your man, your man, your man
Everything we've been through yeah
All the places we've been yeah
Just don't know if I'll be the same again, ha
Ever since you walked all all over me, ha
And even if we bring this back together, ha
You know it won't be the same, no no no no
No no no no no, ha

When this real horny guy came over

He said won't you let me take you
On a ride in my Range Rover
I said you can't be serious
My Bentley's right outside
Plus your breath smells like shit anyway

Gotta have you, oh
Just want to touch you, oh

And this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now
Hoping that he doesn't find me

And dipped my body to the ground

We gon' talk about these playas
We gon' also talk about this game
Heh, this game
Is something everybody wants to know about
But who's the victim?
Is it the player?
The one bein' played?
Or simply this game?

Early in the morning, he waits by her door
But she's not there, 'cause she don't care
Someone else she adores
And it's a quarter after midnight
The girl's by her phone
But he won't call, and the tears fall
So she sleeps all alone

(We're in a world, that's a ball of confusion)
The feeling is gone, still we keep holding on
(To a love, that is just an illusion)
Get to the back of the line
Love will call you in time

On the kaleidoscope of love
People go 'round and 'round in circles
Falling in love and feeling pain
But it's the playa, not the game

See the parade of smiling faces
No masquerade can fade the shame
Too many tracks to hide the traces
But it's the player, not the game

It's not the game

I keep all my feelings in a dark and deep place
Never go there, 'cause it's so rare true love shows it's face
I stare out my window, when I can't sleep at night
Many voices, many choices, but I know when it's right

Hey yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleeping with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like ""Damn!""
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hating me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids, I was out
And my man, I'ma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him
And you can keep the crib, all I'm saying is,
let me find out you got men around my kids

It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage
'Member those days had you smelling my boxes
Old Gold up in the hood and Big Dup
We could push through the grimiest streets, then throw it up
Like ""That's my nigga!""
Anybody got something bad to say, son'll come through and deliver
Brushing off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like ""Phewww"" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tapping my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough
Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow

Hey yo you killed me with that
""Who bought this?"" I bought that
Knowing damn well in reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claiming what's yours
Running all through the house, bugged out, slamming doors
We used to dress like twins, sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?

Fuck it, Get what you got to get and lets get going
Today is the day man

Nigga this is it
Your life and your word ain't shit, spit
This real as it get
Plus, there's no one you can trust
Love what, do it for the lust
Trust, its never to much
Got to get the money in my clutch
Case close shut
Split a nigga gut
Right through the middle like a dutch
Never did like them much, my man
Gather up the artillery
You feelin' me?
What gives, trying to live its killing me
Its all about the whips
Chicks with the hips
Running the number hole, take the chips, ya slips?
Do the dip
See time is moving quick, running out
No time for dumbing out
I got one live to live
A wife, a kid
And I still didn't get the ring or the crib
Look what I did!

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
What you gonna do?
When the G's in the Ree's then the peeps come knocking at your door
When they come for you
And you know, Its all over!
I'm to swift for you
Cause I keep my game trunk tight and a free nigga ride
Here's my gift to you
Now you know, its all over!

You know what this is 
Hughs showed you to get bizz
And what I gotta do to get big
Dick believe, its all about your speed
Cars cash weed
Its all a nigga need, indeed
Seems I was the seed in greed
Born in bullshit
Guns was four-cliped
Finding my self where's nuns and poor pits
Bring it
Step on streets and get to slingin
I'm about to make it hot like piss
Been hungry before but not like this
If lifes a bitch
She needs to get cookin
And cause that fools to get jewels and shit tookin
Baby need milk
When I do it up I need silk
Scales on tilt
That's how a nigga built
I need my money torn like wealth on stilts
Niggas fuck around and get a nigga kilt

[Chorus]

Know why, I'm the antonym of rich consimamon of poor
How could you think of winning on the floor
Your not sure, take the game and went shopping
Your not pure, took the shot for
A penny for your thought, a nickle for a kiss
Well I ain't got a nickle for ya miss
I'm all up in a twist
Fuck all the glamor and the gliss
I'ma hop and skip
Put a slammer in the mix
Till ya is or ya here, the hammer gonna click, clack
Causing you to yelp ""GET BACK""!
I want the cake
The early American china plate
The meeting out of drapes
And bottles of Alizae
So I can put my hoes on Surgio Valitain
Hey, smile and say

Everything's a scam

Was to terminate our love and be free

But I couldn't cry we had a fight long time ago by the liqour store 
Said I didn't want to see your face no more see 
I know pops was just a man but how you hurt someone you love 
I don't understand telephone rings and what am I supposed to do

Heaven can you hear me father can you help me on my knees and prayin' 
Please come through my world is slowly dyin' and lord I'm really tryn' 
It's been awhile since I last talked to you mama said everyone makes mistakes 
If that's true then I really need to see your face so I'll know its gonna be ok (ooook)

I pulled up about five to see my people at my mamas house to see what they was talkin' 'bout 
I haven't seen 'um in a long time (baby are you doin' fine) 
Now it's time to tell 'em what's been on my mind 
Who was there to wipe my tears away and who decided not to show up on my weddin' day 
So y'all tell me what am I supposed to do I just need to hear from you

And be there to take the pain away

You can't get back all the years that's past so while you have the chance you better make it last didn't get the chance to say goodbye and I wish that I could see you one more time

I need a good girl
I need a good girl
I need a good girl

Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Amilio Puchi
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge

[Chorus: x2]
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I don't want no nasty girl

I'ma show you the kiss of life sorta like Sade
G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, oof!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
'Cause (I don't want no nasty girl}

[Chorus]

She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She don't play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl

Carl Thomas,"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it went
Someone had to lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all

Carl Thomas,"What is life?
To live is to believe
To love
Is to receive
Check it out
Check it out now

Young woman confused
Young woman abused
You must understand
It's never too late to lose who you are
And choose who you are supposed to be
Supposed to become
You've been in and out
Up and down, back and forth
Backwards around
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father
Just God and you should make a choice
What you ought to do
What matters most
Who you are to you
Opinions of the old and young
Shouldn't matter to you
Take advice think it over twice
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night
Night is decent, but recently

We have done the wrong things often
Never suicide, that's the easy route
There's always another way out
Think about it (think about it)

Life is like
Life is like a park
Seesaws, merry-go-rounds
And though you may swing high
Sometimes you may even fall down
And though you may get stuck
You must get back up
You are bloomin' love

Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed
You never would've known there was a high road
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them
Instead of bein' mad at yourself
You're only number one in your life
And you will decide if it goes right
Every time you digress
Defeat your progress
Feed you lunch, but you must digest
The controversy yo can get personal
They don't understand it's the role reversal
Seekin' fame, play their games
Gave a whole lot for a whole little game
When push comes to shove
Do you push or shove?
When the choice is yours
Do you leave with love?
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside
When will you decide to survive
Think about it

Copping shit that superceded your salary 
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster

That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father

Cause I ain't with the slavery labor 
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater 
Than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
How we become slaves 
To mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind 
Concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind 
Continue to speak the truth ?til it weaken your spine
Now check it
The jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison

Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty

Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration
Losin' my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n

I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times

Hard times (hard), hard times (Hard)

As this Valium slowly starts to kick in
Them subconscious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin'
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin'
Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody want to blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin'
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin' that
He started tootin' then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
Hard times (hard), hard times (Hard)

A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
Tweleve, thirteen, fourteen years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin' on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin' since in the seventh grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin' now please help me out the water
It can't get no harder
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow

I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (Hard, times)

Carl Thomas,"Loon la lean aka young Marcus
Young, pretty and heartless
And my man CTzy
He make it seem to easy
And the general P D-I double D-why
See why we be fly

Now you can hum all you want to, cum all you want to
But I ain't Mase so run all you want to
Sit there act all dumb if you want to
Spend your whole life in the slums if you want to
I eat good, eat crumbs if you want to
And keep wastin' time with the bums if you want to
I got long though, you know how the song go
My name hold weight, far from a John Doe
It so strange how the game made my arm grow
Used to live in cell blocks, now I live in condos
And every morning I feel like Alonzo
Number one on the pop charts and your moms know
Every time I pull up, there's a car show
Young cats, stay lookin' like the head honcho
My escargot my car go one-sixty
The world's Fargo Parto
Me and Puff like the ""Lone Ranger, Tonto""
Leave the club and we leave with a whole car load
And we got better ratings than a new gong show
But right now you got to let my arm go, see'mon ma

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes)
Oh, yes it is
(Oh, yes it is)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(Gonna be there for you baby)
Oh yes I will (oh woo woo)

Uh, check it out
You choose to lose, only 'cause you confused
If you was with me, I'd probably go abuse them dude
But you runnin' 'round 'busin' shoes
'Stead of 22's that cruise
How you gon' abuse the rude
Girl you runnin' with some popular dude
Poppin' bottles of Voo
Now you seen me and you not in the mood
Girl he has you on the block with his dudes
Different watches to choose
Baby girl I think you got me confused
That's like a chair to a sofa
Ma tell her Oprah, seein' Russell in a pair of loafers
It's evident, that's irrelevant, you was elegant
Taught you proper etiquette, for the hell of it
It's like you feel me, but you not smellin' it
I try to talk but you stay on some yellin' shit
Then you complain about the things that Helen get
Leave me and get the same treatment a felon get

[Chorus:]

Uh, yo
Yo I'm the type when I come through
Mami I do what I want to
As far as you if I want you
Now I ain't come here to haunt you
So you can have a attitude if you want to
I'ma have you, reason why
All four seasons I'm fly
I'ma player, ain't no reason to lie
Ain't no reason for you breezin' on by
Without squeezin' a ""hi""
'Cause I could tell by the gleam in your eye
You like cats with dough that fold up
22's when they roll up
Ma you need to slow up, hold up
Here's a proposition, on the real ma, he got to listen
I know he's loud, cause the top is missin'
But you could be in the Tropics fishin'
By the sea, mami poppin' Crisses
Though it seem kinda optimistic
I got green and a pot to piss in
Fuck with me, you got a lot to witness
'Cause I'ma have you

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes love)
Oh, yes it is
(Sometimes, oh yeah)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you)
Oh yes I will (oh, yes I will)

Wa hoo, I know that love
Don't give you a fan sometimes
Sometimes what you gotta, what you gotta
You gotta reach down and play it with your poker face

But my days the same

That you can always count on me

I was not sure just on how to get you
Now I see just how truly special you are to me
And your love is everything

Time and time when I sit and wonder
Just where you are and just how you feel
And I pray this love will always stay together
Oh, so we can see yeah, if this thing was meant to be

Because the last time I ever thought I see you again
Was the last time I thought I touch your body again
You come back to me after the things I did
Get out my life and now you're back again

I just got the message that you called me
You said that you'll be coming back around
Maybe we can try to make things better
Just work things out

I know people go through many situations
It?s the ups and downs of love tribulations
They say good things come to those with patience
So let me wait because I thought this was the last time

Because the last time I ever thought I see you again
Was the last time I thought I touch your body again
You come back to me after the things I did
Get out my life and now you're back again

As we dance so closely on the floor
You pull me closer tell me so
If you love me let me know or let me go
Let me go

As we dance so closely on the floor
You pull me closer tell me so
If you love me let me know
If you love me let you know
If you love me let me know or let me go
Let me go, let me go

If you love me, it's so good, if you love me

Carl Thomas,"Oh, baby, yeah 
How come it hurts so babe 
Why does it feel so sad 

To fall in love was something that my heart was dreaming of 
And then there came the day when I found you 
And heaven came to earth and you were my angel 
I fell in love with you 
No one but you 

Suddenly I saw the change that came into your eyes 
I feel you were afraid to tell me why 
I thought the thing called love would be forever 
Thought our love was true 
And now the pain of losing you 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love 

Tell me how a thing that brings such joy can bring such pain 
And how could something so wrong seem so right 
We never had the chance to make it get better 
We never said goodbye, no 
I never wanna feel the pain of losing love again 
'Cause love just has a way of breaking down 
Next time I'm gonna pray that things will be better 
The second time around 
So here's to love that's lost and found 

I won't cry, no, I won't break down 
Even though inside it hurts so bad 
Next time I will make love last 
Though you will always have a place in my heart 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love

I won't cry, no, I won't break down 
Even though inside it hurts so bad 
Next time I will make love last 
Though you will always have a place in my heart 

My first love 
No one could ever take your place, no, no 
My first love 
No one could ever take your place, no, no 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything

There's a promise on this mountain that I'm climbing just for you

I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard""
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You want to keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots (ill)
We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill)
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack

And if it is your heart will let you know
To hold on
And don't let it go

Every time you're with them
You find yourself smiling and laughing (if its true)
And every time you kiss them
You ask yourself where has this person been all my life
Two hours apart and you already miss them
Got to listen (to your heart)
You're in love
And there's nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]

True love don't come around everyday
So you should not be afraid to say i love you first (to love you first)
Someone has to break the ice
You cant spend your whole life
With your guards up
Open your heart up
And let love in

[Chorus x2]

Hold on, hold on, hold on
If you really believe
Hold on, hold on, don't let it go
Hold on",If You Ever,2007

About the rain.

He said they 
Sold me down the river 
They thought I was a fool 
They said the rain would fall 
What did they know?

And the song that 
You were singin' 
Though I thought I knew the words 
The tune was quite absurd
And out of key 
Doo dah dah dee.

Carl Weathers,"We all heard what happened at the skating rink today
When Whitey brought up your sad past, you snapped and walked away
Well maybe they're onto something that you should give a try
Go ahead and let it out, and have yourself a cry

Let it out, Davey!
Aw shut your wooden mugs!
Let it out, Davey
Would you check out her bazugs?!

You all need to deal with pain? Well cheers is what I say
This here stuff just numbs the pain, it don't make it go away
You try to act so tough, but you just live a lie
Why don't you show your feminine side and have yourself a cry?

Let it out, Davey
I'll pour you down the sink
You gotta do it, Davey
Y'all can bite my dink

You labels and logos are wastin your time
Makin me sit here
Cause nothin you can say or do
Will make me shed a tear

And won't let down his guard

Without a lover
The feeling of peace I had
All by myself
Free to fill my space with
Things I really wanted
Giving no excuses I even had my own place
Had my own place

Those long nights
Those bright lights
Those carefree days
Those long nights
Those bright lights
I tell you I got it made

Never ever realized that I was lonely
'cause working on the road can be
It can be an escape
Dinner in a one night stop
Just meet me in the hall
Take a number in my black book
And promise to call, promise to call

Those long nights
Those bright lights
Those carefree days
Those long nights
Those bright lights
I tell you I got it made

Then I saw a bright face
Lit by a candle
Sitting in the bar alone
She filled the whole place

The magic of her presence
Who could walk up to her
Who would ever dare to give
This woman-child a chase

Thought my nights were getting better
Just living by myself
But I got hooked this time
Now we got our own place
We got our own place

Those long nights
Those bright lights
Those carefree days
Those long nights
Those bright lights
I tell you I got it made

And I love those long nights

No one ever could have told me how
Heaven could be here on earth

Your soft touch the breeze of life
In your arms I feel a comfort
I surrender in your smile

Heaven could be here on earth

And the warmth of summer sun

Carl Wilson,"Heard you say that you didn't like the state that the world is in
Not a day passes that your faith in man don't get mighty grim
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times

Don't dismay 'cause the dollar won't buy all the things you need
You must pay 'cause some other's gettin' high on his selfish greed
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
You want to settle back into the old days of serenity
If you're just a part of the times

(do) you know you can go on from here
Dim the past your future's clear
Put the effort in what (you know) can be
The world will turn, deal with adversity

You put on a face for the crowd
You try to get past not allowed
You get what you give and you get it deservedly
And you take it a part of the time
You will not get a thing for a dime
You struggle through the passion the greed and the crime

I love you so!

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, you beautiful doll!

Precious prize, close your eyes,
Now we're goin' to visit lover's paradise,
Press your lips,
Again to mine,
For love is king of ev'rything
Squeeze me dear, I don't care!

Hug me just as if you were a grizzly bear
This is how I'll go through life,
No care or strife, when you're my wife
Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, you beautiful doll! Oh, oh, oh, oh","Oh, You Beautiful Doll",1997
Carl Young,"When the fire
In your belly ain't been shrinking
And there's nothing
Laying around that you could be drinking
Take no mind
As that stranger tries to pass you
Is he blind?
Or couldn't he clearly see the train?
Couldn't he feel the bloody stain?
Not that I'm one to complain
Why do we chaw upon the pain?

It's just the rage
Just the rage
Just rage
Rage

Close my eyes
Pull me in and take my tongue
Taste the lies
That dance around us and we're among
Break your heart
Run out now and tear it up
Then you can start
To give that inner brat a hug
Till the dickhead pulls the rug
Take the fall from high above
No details to what you love

It's just the rage
Just the rage
Just rage
Rage

Calls a masterpiece
""Come and paint me, here I am""
And it's my disease
That I am raging all the time
Fought for reason, fought for rhyme
Then I'm walking up the line
The voice it calls
I must abide
Bound for glory on the other side

It's just the rage
Just rage
Just rage
Rage

Just rage
Just rage
Just rage
Just rage
Just rage

I will surely,
Surely lose a lot.

Do do do do do do, oh, yeah

With the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane

Multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots

Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated to the National Trust

Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
