Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"Que no ves que no me importas
Que no vez que no te quiero
Yo siempre te fui sincero
Y no me ando con rodeos
Malamente te clavaste
Y eso si
Que no es mi pedo

Que no ves que no me importas
Quiero ser siempre soltero
No me vengas con cositas
Y me digas embustero
Yo muy claro te lo dije
Y no quiero
Lloriqueos

Yo te advertí
Te puedo dar amor pero no quiero nada enserio
No quiero tus reclamos esto no tiene remedio
Que quieres que yo haga si salí tan mujeriego
Mejor túmbate el royo y una vez mas te lo dijo
Yo no te quiero

Que no ves que no me importas
La vida pa' mi es un juego
Me divierto con plebitas
Agarramos cotorreo
Tu muy bien ya lo sabias
Así que
No estés jodiendo

Yo te advertí
Te puedo dar amor pero no quiero nada enserio
No quiero tus reclamos esto no tiene remedio
Que quieres que yo haga si salí tan mujeriego
Mejor túmbate el royo y una vez mas te lo dijo, yo no te quiero",Yo Te Advertí,2014
Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"Que no le sorprenda 
A ese con el que andas 
Que un día de estos 
Le intercambio unas palabras 
Si esta fuerte o grande no me importa 
Si se me pone rejego 
A ver de a cómo nos toca 

Qué no te das cuenta 
Que me has enamorado 
Y en el amor 
Tengo fama de aferrado
Y si ese canijo me lo impide 
En un topón que yo lo mire 
Ya le quitare lo bravo 

Prepárate porque a tu ventana 
Te llevare serenata 
Ganaré tu corazón 
Sin autorización 
Y si aquél la hace de enredo 
Dile que yo aquí lo espero 
Afuera de tu casa estoy 

Muero por tocarte 
Aunque sea un poco tu pelo 
Pues todo el día 
Te traigo en el pensamiento 
Si quieres lo grito a cuatro vientos 
Pa’ aquél él vaya sabiendo 
Que me muero por tus besos 

Tu duerme tranquila 
Y no tengas pendiente 
Yo me encargare 
Muy bien de tu pretendiente 
Mas vale que se haga para un lado 
Porque si no en estos días 
Rezaran su novenario 

Prepárate porque a tu ventana 
Te llevare serenata 
Ganaré tu corazón 
Sin autorización 
Y si aquél la hace de enredo 
Dile que yo aquí lo espero 
Afuera de tu casa estoy 

Que se vaya acostumbrando 
Porque yo seré tu dueño 
Y que no me provoque 
Que puedo ser muy violento 
Puede que no me aguante las ganas que tengo 
Desde hace tiempo 
De robarte algunos besos 

No me creas tan bravo 
Ni un gallo de pelea 
Pero en cosas del amor 
Me la rifo con cualquiera
Cuando quiero algo yo lo obtengo 
Y si alguien se me atraviesa 
Se lo despacho a San Pedro 

Prepárate porque a tu ventana 
Te llevare serenata 
Ganaré tu corazón 
Sin autorización 
Y si aquél la hace de enredo
Dile que yo aquí lo espero 
Afuera de tu casa estoy 

Y prepárate porque a tu ventana 
Te llevare serenata 
Ganaré tu corazón 
Sin autorización 
Y si aquél la hace de enredo 
Dile que yo aquí lo espero 
Afuera de tu casa estoy",El Aferrado,2015
Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"Puede que te digan tus amigas
Que muy mal la estoy pasando
Desde aquella tu partida
Que me la paso llorando
Y que no salgo ni a la esquina
Por temor a no encontrarte
Que mi vida es un fracaso

Puede que te digan
Que he guardado todas tus fotografías
Que me aferro como un loco a la esperanza que algún día
Te despiertes recordando
Que a pesar de mis errores tuvimos hermosos días

También es probable que te cuenten
Que frecuento los lugares donde me abrazabas fuerte
Que no soy nada discreto cuando alguien te menciona
No sé quedarme callado y le digo a esa persona

Yo, yo era el amor de su vida
Yo disfruté sus caricias y su primer beso
Fue mío y fue mía
Yo, yo entré sus brazos dormía
Yo le arrancaba sonrisas
Mientras le cantaba canciones bonitas
Yo, no supe lo que tenía, me acostumbré a la rutina
Y la hice llorar, ese maldito día

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"No me preocupa 
Que una vez mas este molesta 
Esta tranquila mi conciencia 
Y se que nada pasara

Te atemoriza 
Pensar que yo te dejaría 
Pero mira que ironía 
Es imposible terminar

Porque me amas tanto como te amo 
Y aunque peleamos felices estamos

Una batalla de rutina 
Unos minutos y la ira 
Encontraras la salida 
Y podremos conversar a un acuerdo llegar

Y como diario 
Terminaras en mis brazos 
Cada día mas enamorados 
Y hacer el amor sera el punto final 
De esta contienda una vez mas

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"¿Te acuerdas que dijiste que en la vida 
Tú jamás ibas a amarme? 

Y ahora rendida aquí entre mis brazos 
Yo quisiera confesarte
Que nunca olvido ningún desprecio 
Y menos humillarme
Ya para ti es demasiado tarde
Te lo aseguro, te voy a utilizar

Y me voy a vengar, y me voy a burlar 
Cuando estés derrotada 
Aunque condene al infierno mi alma
Con mis desprecios te voy a hacer llorar

Y me voy a vengar
Te vas a arrepentir de probar de mis besos 
Vas a extrañar mi caricia en tu cuerpo 
Y aunque no quieras me vas a buscar

Que nunca olvido ningún desprecio

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"He contado mil historias 
Muchos las identifican 
Pero en ninguna de todas 
He sido el protagonista 
Si ustedes me lo permiten 
Les voy a contar la mía 
A mí no me causa chiste 
Lo digo para el que se ría 
Voy hablarles de mi vida 

Soy un charro sin bigote 
Que a su potro se aferraba 
Ese que salia del monte 
Con rayones en su cara 
Siempre al lado de mi padre 
Donde quiera me miraban 
Si quería emborracharse 
Yo era el que las destapaba 
También el que lo cuidaba 

Así fue pasando el tiempo 
y Nosotros de arriba abajo 
Luego llegamos al pueblo 
Por cierto cuanto lo extraño 
Seguí pastoreando vacas 
También trabajé en el campo 
Nadie me platica nada 
Tengo callos en mis manos 
Me salieron de temprano 

El reloj siguió su pulso 
Y poco a poco fui creciendo 
Aunque vagué por el mundo 
Nunca descuide a mis viejos 
También hay momentos duros 
A veces nos gana el tiempo 
En fracción de unos segundos
Mi papá se me fue al cielo 
Fue una navidad, recuerdo 

Un saludo a mis amigos 
Y un beso para mi madre 
Les aclaro, soy el mismo 
Que un día se salió a buscarle 
La humildad anda conmigo 
Esa la traigo en la sangre 
Con orgullo siempre he dicho 
Fue la herencia de mi padre 
Creo que me heredero bastante 

Soy un hombre afortunado 
No tengo la menor duda 
Es muy cierto, he batallado 
Y eso es lo que más me gusta 
Tengo gente que me aprecia 
Donde quiera me saludan 
Una familia me espera 
Y la pobreza no me asusta 
Y mientras dios me de licencia
Seguirán ""mis travesuras""",Mis Travesuras,2015
Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"No se 
No se porque mentiste 
Con engaños respondiste 
Al amor que te entregue

Sabias perfectamente que confiaba ciegamente 
Y pensaba que eras fiel 
De mi te aprovechaste y mi alma destrozaste 
Me duele demasiado que aun no lo puedo creer

¿porque? 
Ven y explícame el motivo 
Porque tantas falsedades
Si yo nunca te falle

Dedique todo mi tiempo, mis caricias y mis besos 
Pero no tu no valoraste 
Y a pesar de tanto daño todavía lo estoy pensando 
Pero la verdad, no se si pueda perdonarte

No se, mi mente me traiciona
Me grita que te odia 
No quiere mas seguir 
Me gana el coraje quisiera que te 
Largues y dejes de existir

Pero por otra parte 
Mi corazón te llora 
Dice que te perdona 
Y no se que decidir

No se 
Como pudiste lastimarme 
Si eres lo mas importante 
Y mi vida te entregue

Y aunque quiero perdonarte 
Me cuesta mucho aceptarte 
A pesar de ser infiel

Pero voy a doblegarme
Porque te amo como a nadie 
Y si te perdonare
Tu traición jamas olvidare

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"No estas en condición de poner tus condiciones
Yo no estoy para dar ni para recibir sermones
No estamos en hora de complacencias
Ahorita tengo ganas de acabar con tu paciencia.

Tu guardas tu postura yo sigo en mi posición
Tu ego esta en la luna y el orgullo entre los dos
Si para ti es juego de resistencia
Irremediablemente esto para mi es un adiós

Pongámonos De Acuerdo nos vamos a querer
O ahí la vamos a dejar o de nuevo aparentar
Que aquí no a pasado nada
O amargarnos las vida si se vive un día a la vez
Mejor deja que mis pies
Me alejen de este camino que es la senda equivocada

Ya no te encuentro el lado no se por donde empezar
Si empiezo por el final creo que seria lo mas prudente
A menos que por veinti-única vez tengas una idea coherente

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"Que daría por ganarme tu corazón 
Moriría, el cielo perdería 
Y hasta pecaría por tener tu amor 

Qué te ha dado él que no pueda darte yo 
Si tus manos se dieran el tiempo 
De tocar las mías, anda inténtalo 

Aunque quieras 
Por más que te esfuerces en aparentar 
Que él te quiere, que por ti se muere 
No sabes mentir es más que la verdad 

Él no quiere ya saber de ti 
No le importa si te hace sufrir 
Piensa que sólo te hace feliz 
Cuando te toca 

Él solo quiere satisfacción 
Pero no le pone corazón 
No le duele 
Si una lágrima provoca 

Dudo que él te quiera como yo 
Y que tenga la buena intención 
De entregarte todo el corazón 
Eso no hará nadie más que yo

De abrazarte otra vez

Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda,"Aqui les traigo la cumbia de tomasin 
El es un compa conocido por aqui 
Quiere cerveza y algo para sonreir 
Cada que le hace su lucha para vivir 

Es enfadoso como cochi jabali 
Cuando se enoja el es un chile chiltepin 
Dice la gente cuando lo mira venir 
Claven la cheve por que viene tomasin 

Tomasin poner un peso 
Llega con cualquier pretex 
Y dice plebes denme un trago de eso 

Recuerdo el dia cuando yo lo conoci 
Abia una fiesta con mi amigo serafin 
Estaba solo recargado en un barril 
Nada de tonto la cerveza estaba ai 

Y tomasin por el dinero 
Hasta eso es muy sincero 
Dice no se por que seré tan galletero 

Wuero chaparro como el doctor chapatin 
Canta bonito asta parece cepillin 
Dicen los niños miren los que viene ai 
Ai que asustarlo y se pondra como piolin

Traigo el cuerpo encrudecido
Soy de oficio guitarrero
Me la vivo en las cantinas
Yo cantando me mantengo
Cantando me desahogo
Y por unos cuantos pesos

Yo les canto a los borrachos
También llevo serenatas
Y comparto con mis clientes
Las tristezas que ellos cargan
También me han dado carrera
Cuando nos echan de balas

Me quiere matar la cruda
Anoche llegue borracho
Soy un simple guitarrero
Sin fama y sin dinero

Amigo de mis amigos
De las cantinas bohemio

(Que chulada de canción viejón)

Pensaran pobre mendigo
Cuando paso por la calle
Y aunque a veces mal comido
Nunca le he robado a nadie
La decencia que yo tengo
Es herencia de mis padres

También tengo mi tesoro
Mi tesoro es mi familia
Yo les brindo lo que puedo
Que los quiero ni se diga
Con amor les doy cariño

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come

Never were, really are, nearly are?

And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

Julius LaRosa,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1996

Meets an old immovable object like me

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine

Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Julius LaRosa,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

I wanna go and bounce the moon

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and do it to me

I want you to take this time to see
That I'm more than just a pretty face
I handle myself with class and grace
And do you know how it feels to be
Secretly in love with somebody that you’ve known for so long

So I can't deny the truth anymore
I'm never gonna let you go
Won't let you off my door
Please lie here by my side
Say you'll spend the night

Will you come and do it to me

You’re walkin', you're talkin'
You're eating, you’re breathin'
You do it so right, everything right
You know I'm not dreaming, you are the true reason
I'm living my life 'cuz love is so right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and give it to me
Will you come and give it to me right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and do it to me

Yo, it's like night life, ball fights, brothers getting sliced
Lay niggas, up on the floor, for people acting hardcore (yeah)
And others caught in the crossfire, and dying at age young
They leave .em by their loved ones
People wondering, Toronto Sunday saying, we acting like some savages (savages)
People acting it, pulling triggers and they stabbing kids (stabbing kids)
They pose as bad boys up in club scenes
Keep the grill screwed, leaving blood stains on blue jeans
Then Po-Po, rushes through the entrance, he hits the exits
Hops into his act, wheels spinning on some next shit 
Now we got our G-stripes, bragging rights
Little kids with no direction, look at him right
Cause he got my car to style, Medina robber style
Yeah, he bad now, but remember, what comes around, goes around
(Shh) Who be blind to the future
You need to understand
You need to understand, my man
(Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Peoples get themselves caught up, and then shot up
Bucked to the head for all the shit they done brought up
The situation, got them iller than an AIDS patient
Wild niggas, who be acting like they free-pacing

Now, as time goes by
He's looking out his window, see some people outside
With dark clothes and dark shades
And all around is pure clouds packing rain
He calls his man Jermaine, and tells him that
Shit's going down and meet him at his home, he packs a 4-pound (4-pound)
He waits around, with the sweat dripping from his brow
Where the law be now, nervousness has his head swinging side-to-side
Checks the door, he's see his man up in the ride
He's rolling outside, first looking all around
The sniper fire from the roof, it makes him drop and hit the ground
He makes a mad dash to the car door
Tells his man to move, he slams the pedal on the car floor
Now bullet-proof windows, they be reflecting it
Now he's thinking back up to the party, he's regretting it
But he's deep in it, and there's nothing he can do, but to call his boo
Who be at home, taking care of his one year old 
He says, situation's thick, there's niggas after me
It ain't no stopping them, until they capping me (naw)
Hold the fort down, I.ll be aight, I.ll give you a call in the morn
She says there's two up on my floor, with one kicking down my door
He calls his man Nick, to check the situation (situation)
When he arrives all he sees is an assassination (assassination)
And when they one step ahead, so now an ambush is in the waiting
Understand, you need to understand, my man
(You need to recognize and realize, boy!)

[Chorus: x2]

Now there's vengeance on the mind, time for him to take back what's stolen
He tells Jermaine to meet him at the docks
At 5 o.clock, keep the glocks cocked
I got the blueprints, to run up on these niggas (Word up dog!)
So when the time comes for them to meet
He sees the car, but finds Jermaine slumped in the driver seat (what to do)
People cut themselves off of him, cause if they down they be shot too
His mother's in the rage, face on the front page
Now the man's after him, the clan's after him, mob's after him
He's still at damage son, last thought's killing (uh)
The only thought in his head, now to do is run
Buys his ticket at the International pier son
Not, knowing that there's man
Standing behind .em with, 9-millimeters in hand (He turns around to his surprise)
Feels the burning on the inside, cold on the outside
And the people did the shooting, got away up with his life-time (Ah-yo)

Dear Lord,
I really, I don't even know how to ax this
You know, I can't, this this this is not an act
I must, from the bottom of my heart, ask forgiveness for my sins
But you know what
I ask that you give me the strength to be able to reach 
all of those peoples, on every street corner, every block, every ghetto
All of those people, that we sometimes think are not worthy of blessings, 
they're worthy to me
And I think that as a man given the blessings you have given me
The opportunity to speak, that I need to speak the language 
of those people, and I need to reach them
You know, because there's are a lot of good people on this Earth, 
but there still some people that need a talking to
And I ask you to give me the strength to reach out to those people
You know because I believe everybody is worthy of your blessings
So I ask that you give, you give me, my family, my crew, F.O.S, the circle
All of us, all the babies that are being born
You give us the strength to be able to deal with it how you see fit
because you give all of us the power, as much as some people might not believe it
You give us the strength to reach out and touch a lot people
So Lord I ask you give me the strength to go out in the world and start the fire
You know, start your fire, you understand I'm saying
Lord, just please be with me, be with me 
and give me the strength and let me do this

Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)

It ain't you it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you

If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it

Three times a week, yo keep trying but people

I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren

Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable 
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

Love, love, love, love

My love is yours if you can enjoy
The times spent back and forth
My life's revolving door
My heart is yours, but can I be sure

That this time our love
Anything you do for me
Ain't that the way it's supposed to be
Specially if it's only a situation left to me

You know that I must believe
If you can see then you can achieve
Specially if it's only
A situation left to me for the

Love, love, love
I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love
Until you start approchin' me through

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation

I traveled the long road just me and my intuition
No body seemed to understand just why I left with the clothes on by back
They asked why such a drastic change
I just know that my decision will put me on track

That is why I traveled the long road
So I can smile again feel good inside again maybe even laugh again
I am going to travel

They closed so many doors on me
So I climbed right in the window
'Cause as long as I can breathe I see that my spirit is protecting me
Oh they say that good things come to those who have the patience to remain the same
Don't sacrifice your everything just to be some temporary vision that's gonna change

You've gotta travel the long road
So you can smile again feel good inside again maybe even laugh again
You have got to travel

Just let your heart carry you through cause it knows what you are trying to do
And love is such a beautiful truth it gives strength to make it through
When you walking down the road of life keep your head up and get ready to run
'Cause you probably have to feel some pain
But it's a sacrifice a chosen few will have to make

You've gotta travel
They say that good things come to those who have the patience to remain the same
Don't you sacrifice your everything just to be some temporary vision that's gonna change

You've gotta travel the long road
So you can smile again
Feel good inside again maybe even laugh again

Yo! I'm tryin' not to wear three X's no more
It's OK now Carter stand 6'4
You can hear the insecurity in my voice right
I don't take my chain off on the mics
My security piece
It gives me security (security)
I'm waiting for the ghetto to secure me
I just put away thirty percent for my taxes
Twenty for the feds, the rest under my mattress Huh
I gave my wallet a botox injection
A bunch 'a rude boyz in'a your section
Tryin' to give my tax bracket an erection
A seventies entity Girl look at my complexion
If you can smell my cologne, you're too close
You small time, My +net+ what you made gross
Seven days everyday when you from around my way
I'm married to the life girl, catchin the bouquet

Cause the roof's On and Off's Like They In and Out Of Their Minds
Eggshell pale ti-da-tota on the scale
The old nine's is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
The same time the motherfuckers bargaining and lawyering
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter mil bling-bling, that's the price of fame, lame
I should have a title and a D.E on the chain man
Re-up Gang pyrex over pie roll
Stir it till it's hard, Pop it out, let it dry slow

See me in the Coupe Hot damn It's a new day
I remove the roof as if it's a toupe
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition
I get cash two-twenty on the dash and a self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance
Red Carpet entrance play clothes fashion
Nose in the air I smell a Chanel platinum
Re-Up is the Gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and It all Come crashing

Behind dark tint like we on the prowl
Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done homie, we rich take a bow.

Juluka,"Long ago there was a sound in the night
Kwela man, singing under the street light
A cheap guitar, he gave his sorrow a smile
And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela

You gave it your life

Living low with the Pennywhistle, tea-chest base gang
I followed him home and he danced as he sang
But now he's gone, not even the slightest traces
Of a Kwela song and the street is full of empty spaces

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Nobody knows, did he survive the winding road?
Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland?
Here I stand, lost in the memory
Of a Kwela man, singing in the long gone twilight

When I followed you home Kwela man
You filled my soul, Kwela, Kwela
When you sang your song Kwela man
You gave it your life

Balanced on the edge of the sky
But something always stayed the same
Deep down inside
No matter where I've been the places don't count
Summer in a mountain town
No matter where I've been the places don't count
And I feel let down
'Cause nobody told me

Spirit is the journey
Body is the bus
I am the driver
From dust to dust
Spirit is a story
Body is a book
I am the writer
Together we flow
We hold on, and when the story ends
We hold on, until it begins again
We hold on, we hold on...

I never knew I had one
Till I saw yours shine
Spilling from your laughter
Sparkling in your eyes
Sharing my confusion, sharing my surprise
At finding part of me in you, alive
'Cause nobody told me

Spirit is the journey
Body is the bus
I am the driver
From dust to dust
Trying to be near you
Searching for a way
Listening to your life song
Before it fades away
We hold on, and when the story ends
We hold on, we hold on.

Spirit is the journey
Body is the bus
I am the driver from dust to dust
Now I'm falling, falling away
I hear you calling, calling my name
Spirit move on, move on
Pass my eyes on, on to the next one
I will be long gone, long gone
Across the distance, this divide
I will be with you forever
Till you reach the other side
So hold on, sing this life song

Impi! wo 'nans' impi iyeza
Obani bengathinta amabhubesi?
All along the river chelmsford's army lay asleep
Come to crush the children of mageba
Come to exact the realm's price for peace
And in the morning as they saddled up to ride
Their eyes shone with the fire and the steel
The general told them of the task that lay ahead
To bring the people of the sky to heel
Chorus
Mud and sweat on polished leather
Warm rain seeping to the bone
They rode through the season's wet weather
Straining for a glimpse of the foe
Hopeless battalion destined to die
Broken by the benders of kings
Vainglorious general and victorian pride
Would cost him and eight hundred men their lives
Chorus
They came to the side of the mountain
Scouts rode out to spy the land
Even as the realm's soldiers lay resting
Mageba's forces were at hand
And by the evening the vultures were wheeling
Above the ruins where the fallen lay
An ancient song as old as the ashes
Echoed as mageba's warriors marched away

But hey - the memories seem real
It's been years since I've prayed 
Still insisting
That I don't want to feel

Like you feel 
I set it all on fire
And watched the walls collapse
I stand alone and tired

Now I want it back
And even if everyone is a liar
I don't want to be

Within this silent choir
I want to believe
In something
I want to believe in something

When I close my eyes
Will they come for me
Will you not believe that I
I've learned how to fly

Will I still be singing
Somewhere in heaven
I wonder if angels can cry
I hope they come for me

I hope I see something
I hope that I
Walk into the white light
Walk into the white light

I set it all on fire
And watched the walls collapse
I stand alone and tired
Now I want it back

Even if everyone is a liar
I don't want to be

In something

To believe in something

An old man reads the paper in the booth
Where I stop
To say hello when I'm in town

To ask a friend if you're around
And I think about those summer nights
We never slept we didn't mind

And I felt so alive and happy
Just sitting on the porch
And swinging back and forth 
Now everything seems so distant

But I promise I'm not too far
When you're alone in your brand new car
Driving your new black car
Into the rain

Are you listening to the radio
Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
I imagine you there

I'm sitting by the window here
The morning birds will reappear
And I feel empty
Our songs are on the radio

You call me up but I have to go
And I'm sorry angel
I'm sorry
But I'll call you right back

I swear
You think I've left you there
Alone with an empty chair
But I whisper your name

Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
I imagine you there
Are you listening to the radio
Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
The wind in your hair

Are you tired of watching the rain hit the glass
All alone but aware of the places we've passed
Together we were singing along to the songs
Are you now? are you now?
I'm thinking of you in your college town
Are you thinking of me as you're driving around
Are you listening to me? are you listening?

On the banks that day
As we left the world behind
It was upstream then
Like it's upstream now
In this livelong outside
There's a trestle across the water
Like my hands across that year
For a moment the green was mine 

And our footsteps worn
From years of rain
And it held my hand
Like it holds my name
And my childhood born
And the difference
The water washed away
The water washed away

I'm bruised and red
From the pain of rock
Stepping stones until I fall
And daggers when I land
A roman candle in my hand
Was a weapon to the outside
And I walked in my father's wake
I prayed to a god to take
The endlessness of those shores

And our footseps worn
From years of rain
And he held my hand
He still holds my name
And my childhood born
And the difference
We let the water wash away
The water washed away

The water washed away
The water washed away
The water washed away

By the waterside left
To other souls(soles) without love or hate
They're bleeding the everything
They're soiling the brilliant green

About staying here or leaving

Whoever thought that we would fall?

Standing by the phone
Alone, ignoring your call
I feel like spider man
You got me flying off of the wall

I ain't wanna leave
But still I had to go
'Cause what good is a rainbow
Without my pot of gold?

And now your beds empty
And your pillow's cold
You never realized the love
Until my love was gone, yeah

When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone

Can you stop the free fall?
Can you be the reason
I can see beyond the lies
If I keep holding on?

I hear you (Hear you)
Can you stop the screaming? (Screaming)
Did you stop believing?
I could feel you letting go

Of lonely streetlights 
Sometimes she likes to pretend

And spend a lifetime finding out just where that is

Marble statues and glass dividers
Someone is watching all of the outsiders

Past the mosaic of the head of state

Curtain up
See the couple, coffee shop
Beatniks beating out beebop
Rainy day, skies are gray
But the couple feeling gay
Boy is laughing at her joke
Girl, embarrassed, takes a smoke
She should quit, yes she knows
But she's happy as she blows
Down the cafe, through the bar
Past the hippies and the jars
Of the bean that they drink
Everyday, every week
They should quit, coffee's bad
Makes you crazy, fucking mad
But they say in defense
With a pause for suspense
""It's the stuff of the gods
Sexy smart hot rods!
Roller coaster! Hurricanes!
Super-sonic jet planes!""
They should quit, yes they know
But where the hell would they go?
They're like me, in a bind
Don't you see?
Love ain't blind

Scene two
Same play
Same people
Different day
In a car with no top
No speed limits, no cops
Girl is driving, she's the queen
In control of this machine
She is talking much too loud
Excited by the sound
They are screaming, buzzing hard
Open road, super car
What they need is some speed
105 is the key
Life is short, so they say
Carpe diem, seize the day

City streets
Buying shit, selling too
Need a fix or some food?
Or some sex? There's a whore
Looking beautiful but bored
Like to drink?
There's a bar
Need a lift?
Take my car
A stop for every whim
Your heart's desire lets you in
In this city, in this scene
At this party you are queen
You're addicted to the lights
To the sounds, to the sights
To the pleasure, to the pain
The hot nights, the cold rain
To the smoke, to the drink
To the buzz, don't think
To danger to the fear
To the speed, it's fifth gear
All the time, night or day
There is no choice, it's just the way

"Jump, Little Children","Violent dreams
Every night
Lately I've been waking out of urgency
Something I said
Something I did
Is bringing on this violent emergency
One black day in ghostly white
For just another sleepless night
One more day
I'm always taking the dive
All it takes
Is all I can give
All my waking hours just to see you live
Through this sleepless night
Violent dreams
Every night
Patiently waiting in the waiting room
Hospital white
Hospital lights
Burning an unbearable fluorescent gloom
Still with both my eyes shut tight
It's just another sleepless night
One more day
I'm always taking the dive
All it takes
Is all I can give
All my waking hours just to see you live
You behind closed eyes
Behind closed doors
""First thing tomorrow""

She's hanging by a needle and a thread

Turning instead
Of turning in bed
Turning off the static on the T.V. screen

I can sit here drinking licorice tea
And stare up at the golden moon

Hot sun in the middle of June
You were there in your peach silk dress
Laughing at me 'cause I was a mess
A tall glass of lemonade
Come on let's go lay down in the shade
It really wasn't that long ago
It really wasn't that long ago
And I can sit here in my rocking chair
Down by the riverside
And I can think about your golden hair
But I'll think about my foolish pride

Lay down your head sweet rosemary
Just you and me and a distant hound
Just one kiss and the sun went down

Close enough to be seen
Far enough to be safe

Hiding out in the moonlight

All alone in a crowd
Firmly set in his ways

A last look, a last chance
Gone away too afraid

And he waits...
And he waits...

Floating up in the limelight

Half as much as he did
When he was offstage

Every dream that he chased

As he opened my wallet on the street 
Please god please can you breathe a little softer 
It's hard enough to stand up straight cause I'm beat 
Don't call your girlfriend on the phone 
There's lots of other numbers you can use 
Get this dial tone off me 

Let's go out and get some coffee 
Caffeine will make you less and less confused
I didn't want to be Chinese 
I just ended up in this part of town 
I'm an entertainer 
And I will try to make you saner 
At least turn your frown upside down 

Her take a look upon my face 
It's dark, I know you can't see at all 
But try and take some notice 
At least try and focus 
Or else you're going to stumble or even fall
There's a man coming from the south land 
Just coming off the fix, the sleeve tricks 

Strike it up if judah sticks 
The brass band, hold hands 
Right across the new land 
Have an accent pay your rent, at least conceal your identity 
Cause it's cheaper when it's free 
The warble in the purple 
And the bubble's in trouble again

I heard there was a murder just upstairs 
I saw the graffiti on the van 
The tears on her cheek, were as clean as a squeak 
A crack in the window and they ran 
Please let me hold you by the belt the fall is at least three stories down 
It's easier I swear, comb your teeth and brush your hair 
A few flights of steps and we're into town

""do you smoke opium?"" he said 
As he offered the back seat of a cab 
If you have no quid, don't you even make a bid 
Don't worry, I'll just put it on your tab 
The yellow of the hood began to roar 
The seat became soft or so it seemed 
Just press it to your skin, and let the fun begin 

The music inside your throat will make you scream

And snuck across the kitchen floor
And is playing a tune while I'm counting sheep

I was making my way back home
Walking on the broken bottles
Swinging from the streetlights,
Swinging home
And I was walking along with a spring in m-why bended kn-ee
Walking on a leather sidewalk
Feeling like a cow-boy
Riding on
And the moon
And the moon.....is smiling down
A tip of the hat and a square of the chin
To the corner milky whites
Walking on a city streetlight
Grazing on the as-phalt
Hanging out
A burning machine like a red hot iron wagon wheel
A wild horse in the city traffic
Screaming out ""car crash"" in my ear

Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh 
Broken glass from the tin can candy
The tin can candy red
Blue smoke and cold sweat shower
Screaming out ""si-lence"" in the crowd
And nobody moves cause nobody ca-an
Stand back on the city corner
Everbodys wondering if they're dead
A hollering whoop from a redhead ambulance
Take off like a magic carpet
Rub the red lantern and make a wish
....and the moon.

Holding up a singer

In my coffee cup(x2)

Smells like supper time

Jumping in the lily, jumping in the sunshine kiss

Come come kiss me just before I'm dead""

Jump5,"It's like I've got nothing to do but think about you (all I can do, all I can do)

Everyday is a new day
And I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy
But I don't want this to end

When I have the chance I wanna say to you
Wishing I could take back what I put you through
I'll never do it again
We're like oil and water still we somehow mix
And what used to be broken is somehow fixed
It's hard to explain

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we
We will be together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart
You'll know from the start
That's its all I can do
Not to think about you

I gave you good reason
To walk out that door
Let me tell you I've learned a thing or two

And I'm so amazed at the things you do
Now don't let me go oh no

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we,
We're meant to be together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart
You'll know from the start
That's its all I can do
Not to think about you

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we,
We belong together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart
You'll know from the start
That's its all I can do

Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

You were the friend, you were the one I could confide in
You gave me strength that I could never find
Deep emotions that's I've always been denying
I believe in, its so close now, its you that

Something so perfect it's hard to believe

Some things in life you know you just can't explain
The rest you just don't need to know

C'mon and dance with me, dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason, give me a sign
Let's get this party started c'mon and dance with me tonight

C'mon c'mon c'mon, yeah, yeah
C'mon and dance with me, hey hey hey

With just a smile you can make my knees weak
Forget my name and the day of the week
You make me crazy, the things you can do
My head is spinning with thoughts of you

Now here he comes he's walking over to me
Is it real or is it fantasy?

C'mon and dance with me, dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason, give me a sign
Let's get this party started c'mon and dance with me tonight

Dance with me, c'mon and dance
Dance with me, c'mon
Dance with me, c'mon and dance
Dance with me

C'mon and dance with me, dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason, give me a sign
Let's get this party started c'mon and dance with me tonight

C'mon and dance with me, dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight

I want to feel the new day that comes

Then let somebody clip my wings

I'll learn to fly, ya ya

I see the world how it could it be
Dreaming in color
It looks so beautiful to me
Dreaming in color
In reds and blues a thousands hues
Coming in clear and bright
We don't have to live in black and white
Dreaming in color

When everything is looking gray
And nothings really going my way
Everybody tells me that I shoot too high
I don't let it shake me, no no
There's a secret place that I go
All I have to do is stop
And I close my eyes, ya ya

Is there to touch
Is there to feel

It's like I woke up and my day belongs
And nothing goes right hall of fame
It's like a simple song and 
I can't seem to get it straight

But I'm in the world premier
And I just can't get through the lines
And everything I touch goes wrong,

Seems like a little stone

Oh why, oh why
So I don't worry 'bout the little things in life
Cause it's my time to fly tonight

I know sometimes it's hard to walk
When being knocked around

But circumstances, state of mind
Don't live life on the ground

winter nights and days,

That means so much to me,
That you've got to be

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.

And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings 

[Violent J]
Heard what's going on in the free world 
Broke out the asylum and killed a girl 
Just to warm you, just to get it on 
'Cause I'm gonna be cutting throats till the break of dawn 
Can't nobody get me 
I've always been a psycho now they coming with me 
That's straight when we team up 
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut 
Look in my brain its fucking insane 
Roll around naked in the acid rain 
Rich bitch fucka took me for a sucka 
Now we killing you instead of killing each other 
Walked in the house, shot him in the mouth 
Leaned back the head, and pulled the brains out 
My list are strong its only a saw 
The government fronts like they don't know what is going on 
Fuck, I'll take the matter in my own hands 
Cut ya down cat, cut ya down 
'Cause I know the rich go jogging 
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin

But ya keep the killer in one place, 
But I'm at ya door, motherfucker have a taste!

Jumpsteady,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Time swifts back upon my bed
As the undead walk inside my head
Don't you hear the ghostly calls?
Transcending from beyond the walls
They have shown in this life I've known
There's another world beyond our own
Twisted, broken, shadow land
Connected by paths of emerald sand
Have you seen the things I've seen?
Been visited by phantom beings?
Haunted by those in hooded cloaks
Or been in the séance to invoke
Many who see don't believe
Because they chose naivety

(Chorus)
Don't you know that ghosts exist?
Do you believe in exorcist?
Don't you know that demons live?
Do you live a life of sin?
Don't you know they'll comfort you?
Depending on the path you choose
Don't you hear the ghostly calls?
Or do you hide behind your walls?

Spiraling back into my past
The nightmare upon my mind is cast
Remembering a time so long ago
When death took me into its fold
As a young child awakening
Face in a pillow suffocating
All my senses were there to me
But I couldn't move and I couldn't breathe
As I died I realized
There was a reason I was paralyzed
Inside that room I was not alone
There was a presence neither flesh or bone
Even though I could not see
I felt its evil beyond imagining
More afraid of it than death
I broke its hold upon my flesh

(Chorus)
Can't you hear the child's screams?
Can you see horrific dreams?
Can't you feel your death embrace?
Can you follow the path of grace?
Can't you see the world I see?
Can you see the reality?
Do you remember a time like this?
Or is it locked away in your subconsciousness?

As a child, I heard ghostly calls
Striping insanity from my walls
A female voice would come to me
And say my name repeatedly
Death's temptation from the grave
Spoken word my life did fade
Slowly forget as the years go by
Plagued by nightmares, I wonder why
Dreams of a car flipping end to end
Screams of a woman is deafenin'
When I awake, I'm rememberin'
The explosions of pain and dismemberin'
Then one day a vision forms
Inside my mind a dream was born
I drove a car that's now destroyed
A woman's inside like a broken toy
Blood goes cold as I realized
Her face is too bloody to recognize
Looking through my horrified eyes
Somehow I loved this woman who died
Turning to me upon deaths embrace
She calls my name out to space
It's the voice of my childhood ghost
I reach for her, but the vision is lost

(Chorus)
Won't you step up through the gate?
Will you face up to your fate?
Won't you hear their ghostly calls?
Transcending from beyond the walls?
Won't you enter the shadow land?
And walk upon the emerald sand?
Have you seen what I have seen?
Or do you choose to be naïve?",True Stories,2003

If I was set on the right path Or did I make a big
Mistake so long ago

[Chorus]
Cause all I can feel is..All I can feel is more weight than
Ever before All I can feel is.. All I can feel is blistering
On my bed All I can feel is..All I can feel is more
Weight than ever before All I can feel is..

For years, we were bathed Drowned in all this dirt
That ruins our lives And one day we step up and we
Shake it off with a smile Please work this out Someone
Please tell me who is responsible For letting us grow up
In this hive of bastards and lies and enemies

And the little you've showed me Has rendered me away
And the scars that you gave me Are still repeating, slamming
On my door

But what I can feel is this better day
Woke up to sounds of gulls on the bay
I've gotta make use of this beauty today
'cause it could drag me down..The weight
Could drag me down back to where I began

Because we're far apart

And still she's in my heart

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Dirty movies, credit cards and bills past due again
And that son of mine spit in my face and then I tanned his eye
He got a taste of Appalachian pride

That sassy son of mine, he was more than I could take
I loaded wife and kids and dogs and then I pulled up stakes
Back home here in the old home 'stead I've kept him by my side
And filled him with my Appalachian pride

We're praising God in everything we do
Thankful we had this to come back to
We don't have much money, but we're dignified
And happy in our Appalachian pride

There's hell mud in the smoke house, some flower in the ban
Molasis, cans and beans until crop comes in
The kids back in that bedroom, they finally understand
The pride of an Appalachian man

Now we don't live on welfare, we don't need the checks no more
We got sick of bill collectors a-banging on the door
We'll break our backs from dusk till dawn and God is on our side
And we'll make it just on Appalachian pride

June Carter,"I got tired of New York City, of its sidewalks and its heat
So I got myself a great big horse and I rode him down the street
And then I hollered, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" and, ""Get 'em up, Scout""
But I suffered aggravation and a great humiliation
So I finally said I'd let the story out

You can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You can't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Well, he broke into a cantor down around ol' Times Square
And my cowboy boots and hat, I left them somewhere way back there
Then he stomped and reared and turned and bucked
And took off to the South
And I slid through Gatsby's Restaurant with his tail stuck in my mouth

But you can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You don't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Now, down at Gatsby's Restaurant, there's a picture hanging there
Of a petrified Italian with escargot in his hair
And there's a big, white horse rug lying by the door
And I'm washing dishes in the back and sweepin' up the floor

But you don't ride a big, white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You don't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Where he sat waiting in the night
And her hands trembled on her Bible

Oh, my heart is almost broken
And then she let go of his hand
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

You've been in the arms of another
And one who says she is my friend
You've kissed her and held her and loved her
And taken her places that we've been

June Carter Cash,"I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be

June Carter Cash,"I got tired of New York City, of its sidewalks and its heat
So I got myself a great big horse and I rode him down the street
And then I hollered, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" and, ""Get 'em up, Scout""
But I suffered aggravation and a great humiliation
So I finally said I'd let the story out

You can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You can't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Well, he broke into a cantor down around ol' Times Square
And my cowboy boots and hat, I left them somewhere way back there
Then he stomped and reared and turned and bucked
And took off to the South
And I slid through Gatsby's Restaurant with his tail stuck in my mouth

But you can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You don't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Now, down at Gatsby's Restaurant, there's a picture hanging there
Of a petrified Italian with escargot in his hair
And there's a big, white horse rug lying by the door
And I'm washing dishes in the back and sweepin' up the floor

But you don't ride a big, white horse into the front of Gatsby's door

Leave at your own chosen speed;

Go lightly on the ground;

There's a bright and a sunny side too
But if you meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Oh, the storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
Clouds and storms will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us, every one, in His care

I'll cease this wild weeping drive sorrow away

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through ill and misfortunes all others above
Now another has won him, oh misery to tell
He left me in silence no word of farewell
He taught me to love him, he called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
But I awoke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all faded away

When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away you'll cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
And you'll come back for me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this and you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of all the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry",Cry! Cry! Cry!,2009

And time keeps draggin' on

On down to San Antone

Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns

I hang my head and cry

In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move out over a little

But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

And I thought I was gonna jump with joy

Concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded
On the pages of God's holy word

Desiring to lower her standards

They long to find fault with her teaching
But really she makes no mistakes

I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look

I needed the celebration
of September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

I've watched the gentle winds change
The colored shades of meadows
I've seen the dillon flowers
That had no name
But I let my vase stay empty
Like my old and empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

Lets gather up our scattered words of love
And make them rhyme

Lets go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases

Don't you think its come our time?

Would you take the small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And the feeling that your love is close at hand

Thank you for the flowers
Now lets walk through the meadows
To the road where our divines caress the sand

Don't you think its come our time to be together

June Carter Cash,"I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come out time

Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand

Through the brook where our demands caress the sand",Don't You Think It's Come Our Time,2014

She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Behold how my lover loves me!""

When did she slip away?
When did trouble walk through the door and stay?

Equal parts of hope and fear

June Christy,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnet

I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past

A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic

Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover

June Christy,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears

He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school

He has no manners when he eats his food

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi
A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?

Time after,

Sometimes you picture me,
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said,
Then you say,go slow,
I fall behind,
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost you can look,and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you,I'll be waiting 
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has 
Turned to gray
Watching through windows,you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time,

[Chorus]

You said go slow,
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds,

[Chorus]

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time",Time After Time,1994
June Christy,"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night, in tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each nights a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

June Christy,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're ev'rything to

Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to

Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too",Make Someone Happy,1996
June Christy,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship,1996

Since I can't remember when.

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you.
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again.
It's been a long, long time.

And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view

And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream

As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,

And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale, the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in Paris ,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do, I  love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me.

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year, the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in Cape D'Antibes , or in Spain,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the cloud

Ah, the apple trees,
And the hive of bees,
Where we once got stung,
Summers at Bordeau,
Rowing at bateau,
Where the willow hung,
Just a dream ago,

June Christy,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today
