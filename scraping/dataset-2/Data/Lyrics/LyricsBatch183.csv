E-40,"It is what it iz
It is what it iz

You try compromisin', nope, they don't wanna talk
And they got them nuts that's off that Acapulco powdered chalk
So he untouchable, oh he can be touched?
Well where he stay at then, he stay by such and such?
Well since we got altercations with these so-called knuckleheads
We gon' play for dooms
And I assume we get radar on fool in dem livin' rooms
Bet, motherfucker ain't fin' ta be runnin' around here drippin' sweat
Havin' hot flashes and shit 
Over these fulla bitch-made and a half-ass dicks
You ripped? let's take it to 'em sick
Hit all they spots at once, pour it on 'em thick
Who got the suey chops? they in my folks garage
Well where he at? he at the travel lodge, beep that nigga!
Tell him to get here right now quick now it's gon' be some shit
Tell him to bring enough ammunition to blow up a ship
Bullshit ain't nothin' this here been goin' on just a little bit too long
Plus I got a family and kids to raise and I plan on seein 'em get grown
Get straight to the root of the problem
Get rid of the source that's what what
Get rid of the big cheese 
And the majority of these niggaz gon' back the fuck up
Somebody gon' mind somethin, time to validate my resection
Hit the corner dumpin, in the big-ass ? station wagon
Catch them bitch-ass! that's what I told my driver man
While I was tryin to get him to get in a position 
So that I could open fire
Fuck a ski mask! unpolished fish grease
Let the fully blast! may he rest in piss miss smash up outta there
I brought them boys, but I shoulda brought it like a concert
Fool's still alive, John Murell trauma center, concord
Shoulda doused him, shouldn'ta never found him
Shoulda handled biz, but for now, it is what it iz
It is what it iz
It is what it iz
It is what it iz

Aight, ay dude, this all I wanna know
What's wrong with this sad to be glad-ass noggas?
Don't they know that fools is laced with assassin skills?
Kill at will, gonna put your hat on the rack for a cool mill'?
(aww it's gon' get done) but now the heat has been spared
How we gon' get him out of intensive care
And put him under the wing of a pall-bear?

One of my potnahs got a plug on some silencers, he knows some agents
He used dem ? shot on several different occasions
What that mean his family gon' boo-hoo when I smash that card
Better stay on a nigga brain give a fuck about a die-hard!
I know this one botch with a big-ass crotch by the name of Connie
She works in I,c,u and she dates this nigga named Mitchski Ronnie
Have nab him at the hospital, that'll work
Paid a nurse to pull the plug on the life support
Risky business but it's organized class and the shit sound sharp
But if we fuck around and make it look too obvious
The broad might her lose her job
Tough luck that shit no better than fuckin' for me now
I gots no toilet paper feelings for her anyhow
The shit is crampin' my livin' style, floatin' from telly to telly
Conspiracy murder plots phone conversations overheard by fedarale
I'm guessin' fool musta passed away, tragic losses
On the wall they got my picture at the post office
After travellin' bouncin' back and forth to different states
They finally caught me up in kansas city
At a barbecue spot called gates
Do the crime do the time, it ain't for no bitch
And as long as a nigga twerkin' in the kitchen, he ain't trippin'
I'll be up in that bitch makin' spreads, drinkin' pruno
Cocoa and coffee cadillacs, jumpin' jacks
Takin' flicks, shootin' kites, makin' wishes
Fuck around and get mad on the strength of con-ju-gal vi-sits
Flip the weight pile, hit my fee-vee
Keep my shank close by me when I'm slee-py
Shouldn'ta caught me, shouldn'ta never found me
Shoulda handled biz, but it's too late, it is what it iz
It is what it iz
It is what it iz
It is what it iz

Oh, oh I see
It is what it was, and what it was is just what's been taught
Handle biz when it's to be done, and I mean rip you dig?
Cause ain't no sense in savin' leftovers
That's yesterday's thing, roll with the right now
And everything gon' be is, what it iz.",It Is What It Is,1996
E-40,"Ay 40 mayne, I seen one of yo' hoes
Last night mayne, she was just uhh
(Hmm)
She was tryin' to give that ass
Away for free mayne, whatchu gon' do?
(Aight, I'ma tell you like this)

It's like dis, just point out the target
And I'll bet some cash I can't miss
This nigga done started 'cause I got some ass
From his bitch, more broken than hearted
Fool on the hill over this but I'm just as retarded
I act a fool up in this bitch, the reason why she departed
'Cause she was tired of gettin dissed

Dotted and darted all in her eyes like this
But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
And leave that ol' [unverified] around shit up to them
Squares like Urkel, it's too many lobsters up in the ocean
Big pimps but not enough mobsters breakin' them in
Big pimps tellin' forty, done taught us how to begin
Pull a bitch off the streets and reel her in

To my sable, but everybody ain't able
Now she's a call girl, dancin' on the table
Sound like somethin' Iceberg Slim woulda said
(Tell me)
The bigger the pimp
(The bigger)
The longer the bread
(The longer)

Keep pimpin'
(Forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

Keep pimpin'
(Forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
(Yes, your honor)
Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

She looked at her reflection in the mirror
(In the mirror)
Told herself, from this day
Here ain't NAR a nigga pumpin' fear
Took all I can, but I can't take no mo', enough
Yesternight I got my ass slapped up, kinda tough
Got me lookin' like a rainbow
(A rainbow)

Black eyes, aches and pains, bruises purple and yellow
But I forgive and forget 'cause it's all gravy
(That's right)
I used to fuck for free but now I'm gettin' money lately

Big-ass dookie mayne, big-ass breasts
But the bitch got more miles on her, than SouthWest
You can have that hoe, mayne, but, nigga, please
Is that any kind of broad you want to make yo' main squeeze?
The mental, be timin' and thinkin' hairy

All kind of cracks and crevice
Makin' cranny, man, the bitch don't even wear no panties
Sound like somethin' Dolemite woulda said
The bigger the pimpin', the longer the bread, beotch

Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
(Yes, your honor)
Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

I take seven switch-a-bitches put 'em in a line
Put 'em on the hoe stroll and make 'em work for mine
Take a mud duck, turn her into gold
Make her sell her ass up in the North Pole
From Lebanon, to Yugoslavia, from Petersberg, to Nova Scotia

I got niggaz in 'Sace suits, trickin' big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin' in justice, corporate executives
Athletes, 'cause they respect a bitch, man you'd be surprised
How many niggaz love to pay for pussy

Niggaz cheat on they wives and jack up
All they fuckin' money, man
I be givin' my hoes, bonuses and benefits
Boat cruises and Kamal outfits

Latex to keep their health a good
Checkups at planned parenthood
(That's it)
Best run witcha pimp, yes your honor
Practice your profession keep your head above water
Sound like somethin' Felix Mitchell woulda said
The bigger the pimpin', the longer the bread, beotch

Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

Keep pimpin'

Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'

Beotch, c'mon

Do do dooo, do do dooo
Do do dooo do, do do dooo
(Pimp)

(That's right)
That you want me to, beotch

Anything, that you want me to do

To be the King it seems I need a killer team to get the green for me
Hit the scene clean in my Chevy, now I'm ready for trouble
Count my rocks, set up shop, collect my fetti and bubble
Faded visions of me as a timer
though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama, ha-ha
They got me crossed tryin to be the boss, no one can stop us
Niggaz dream of six figures, handle our business in choppers
Feds can't comprehend my ghetto slang, so I evade
and plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my chedder main
Help me if I fall, can I ball for life
A half a key in my drawers, bein cautious like
I wanna rise keep my eyes open
Witness motherfuckers die with they eyes open, my niggaz rise smokin

To have a million dollar spot gettin riches, nigga

In my million dollar spot

Nothin but a dope fiend party y'all

Up in the refrigerator?

You can dip but don't screw up, speakers on sub

Get super twisted highly afflicted every day a cherry
Go on my body and throw up on the bartender
Pull out a wad of money, ballers up to par
Treat the whole party, by buyin' up the bar
Sharp pain and orange juice got my moose up
Stainless artichokes, tequila poppes, Medusas
Better prepare myself for the upset stomach, oh

Hangin out the sunroof of my brougham caddy-mack
Ham sandwich with the beez off in the back

Thoroughbred tenders like that, smashed out

Dabbed out, bust a pattern, leave em smokin
Just like felix mitchell and them used to do out there in oakland

Kick a bootch smooth up out my car if she get to actin like I ain't pokin

He couldn't help that shit if he wanted to

Doin it like it should be, hittin it from the back
Look at me couple more times and one of dem nigga's just a mack
Wantin the 6-9 for a minute while he's down in my lap

The only one who ever saw my face, I must erase, had to get filthy dirty
Left him in his driveway soaking wet, hope nobody heard me
I'm out that muthafucka with about 4 pounds of that shamrock
Zip lock, body bag, toe tag, wet t-shirt, black mask
In and out fast, murderous, vast vigorous
Stroke that nigga like a zig zag rolled cigarette,
And I do it to get my dick wet
Brain grain rotten, I was a 12 year old gettin' raped by my momma's partner
So I've been in pussy since I could start nuttin'
I'm off that cloraseptic and that robatussin
Had a appetite for the wrong nigga, said he was real meat but I knew he wasn't
Had me dumpin' out the back of cadillac's on walter
Got a stinky smell to him, can't even hug my momma
I'm so sick I can't sleep at night, might swallow my tongue
Get all the gas deposits out the closet, let the water run
Get the flame thrower, lighter fluid, paper plates, 'cause we barbacuin'
In a funky situation that's how we do it

Situation, baby it seems I'm in a situation again
I fuckin' realize it's a situation of sin
Sometimes I just want to stop tryin'
Why must this shit always involve dying?

Runnin' shit like sosza, big bank hank
Smebbin' in a high performance zooped up nova, pushin' crank
Callin' shots on my gossipper, faulty chip
1-800 locker number, on the left side of my hip
Neighborhood watch better watch that ass
I'm a paperboy and I collects that cash
One more muthafuckin' complaint and your ass ain't gon' last
On a block where I clock cash so fast
This is a stick up, nigga, don't even try it
If you go as far as to blink an eye, muthafucka you gon' die
Pressure I apply, no lie, I got just finished doin' 10
For what? for killin' my best friend
And I'll murder again if I'm forced, then I must
After the first time the second time was a rush
What about the third time? the third time felt like sex
What kind of guns did you use? choppers, uzis, teks
Whatever one works best
I'll make a mess upon shooting flesh, 'bout 15 holes in his chest
Vandalism, taggin' all muthafuckas names on the wall
Scandalism, dyin' over all kinds of senseless shit that's small
Auto theft, stealin' cars for fun
Snatchin' purses 'cause I'm young and dumb
If you a tourist check yo' map, don't make the wrong turn
Might end up in the hood where you gon' be learnin'

But I'm an over achiever around these heaters
I don't need a bitch, society done fucked up and cheated that bitch
Now she lookin' for a nigga like me to feed her and shit
Dumb bitch better quit, that muthafucka first degree keep a leash on his dick
Take notes, sit by the poor folks, I tell you 'bout my strokes
But I done been gave that up, ain't healthy no more
'cause a this yappin' and feelin', she strapped with the homies
And her weak mind got all of Sacramento in a bind
Lizzy ann must die, the situation just ain't right

I said I got mines, get off your ass and raise your daughter

Peniles at my door, three in the front, nigga, four through the back
Talkin' bout takin' me down to the sac town county jail,
Strapped up 'cause I did a jack
Armed and dangerous, waited 6 months to come and get me
Knowin' I'm into straps, 'cause every time I get caught one was sittin' with me
2 time before this, now add one more to the program quick
Shackled down, now I'm on a mission to a one man cell with the quickness
Think about the work that I did that night and what went wrong,
To get a rider caught
30g bail cost to get me off, fightin' on the street, fuckin' watched
Every 2 weeks another court date, thinkin' I can win, that's no lie
Kept on goin' on for some months, lookin' the judge right in the eyes
Feelin' his anger,
Watched fools before me do petty crimes and he's givin' 'em time
Bein' a bitch about muggin' on me, nigga talkin' shit to me, heated like
Pointing guns at individuals, huh, I despise muthafuckas like you
So it ain't no love for me judgin' you, watcha gon' do?
Take it to another court room?
And that's the first step for me, my lawyer knew the d.a.
You know, so he tried to hook a brother up, you see
If I did take a deal, it's only one year guaranteed
But I'm bout to give work for dough in a couple more weeks
Tryin' to give 10 years, if I go to trial and lose the muthafucka
Then I messed around and had to go back to the first judge,
Sayin' don't work for ya
I wasn't gettin' off that easy, my case had a little substance
And the odds are stacked against me, no frontin'
Choices need to be made on the 7th
A catch 22 in my midst, 'cause either way I'm fucked
Go to trial where I'll probably lose, or take my ass on the run
Or take a deal to a lesser charge, either one I'm gettin' struck
'cause doin' time is a mando thang and that got a muthafucka stuck

On my way to see my weebles up in deep east Oakland,
Smokin on some premo, in a clean ass, coke white El Camino,
Dual exhaust sparkin,
Park it like Reno, I ain't soft I see some hoes in miskina,
Lookin like they wanna get tossed,
E-40 you be careful 'fo I tell one of yo biggest fans,
Do what you do all I listen to is you Maxwell, and Erykah Badu.

Foolish as a youngsta I packed eightballs,
Broke the ice, an often sold weed to stars,
But hey now an they how I run my sweet,
Yay Deep from the lungs to expose my heat,

From here to California have 'em holdin my cream,

To a, six-seven coupe left wit a luggage rack,
To a 400 SEL,

Rappin niggaz, an hustlin that's my bread an butta,

Check out her body, take a look at how the crack took toll
Went from being fine as hell to look at my guest or roll

Was i really such a bad child that i deserved to get hit with boards
And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that i was your creation,
And all i wanted from you all was love, hope, and motivation?

Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back,
Get out my face, kicked me out the house
And wouldn't even let me plead my case.
Now i'm homeless and i'm freezing like the morgue,

The only thing keepin me alive is the lord
Needless to say it's times like this i'd rather be locked up then
Drinkin water out my hands and eatin out of garbage cans
Can i come back home, huh could i?

Tried out for the army but i was flat footed,
Didn't do no harm to me, 'cause i was used to it

If i apply for some work, let's make a bet,
I'll get the nine
'Cause i don't know about the internet

I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll probably end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next

My auntie brenda turned her own sister in
For writing bad checks
And save folks try to hit you where it hurts
Knowin' they the biggest hypocrites in the church

I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want a hip
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house

They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll is like fuckin, fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
anyway cuz I gotta stay paid 40

Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area

I walk from Foothill and Paperscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie B house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
it's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
and even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes

I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, cuz I love money main

I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick

I know, she was a good person for certain I know
V-Town, California where I was born, raised and grown 

And since 1979 I been a hustler on the go
You know the drill, my mission for real, a mealticket
You feel, we slowly but surely approachin seven digits
Figurines, sticky doo-hicky and angel dust

Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track 
She use to hold my sack

I use to dick her down way back in 86
She use to look just like a skank
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy that bitch is bad
For what it`s worth, the pussy smelled like Certs

Now folks just remember I never said I thought about lickin pussy 
I said I never thought about eatin
Keepin it and treatin it nice

Where I live, on the outskirts
And down on the tuck in the cut

""How can I kill this odor, and purchase me a Lincoln?""
Minimum wage flippin patties - nope

You got my back I got your shoulder
Peas and toes, tryin to make it, it`s all oh`s
Impossible is a hit never get caught diggin in my nose
Ex d-boy used to be a big time neighborhood rock star
Although I never owned a gui-tar
I-uh-I`m lyrically inclined with my start stutter scrilla
Type delivery, 40 and Busta Rhymes, was drinkin
And smockin hickory, on the porch one time
When I came up with this line: I was perkin
Off of some of that Carlos Rossi wine -- whatcha playa patnah got
Flows, like a latina female orgasm

Blow smoke out my face, pick up the pace
Speed up the race, never let a hot joint go to waste
My dogs`ll bark when your marksman trespass
You better use caution, your body parts might get auctioned
No need for you to keep stalkin, HELL but what you talkin
Have you dusted like a zombie lookin straight Christopher Walken

About these other corny rappers that ain`t got nuttin for me

Doin it for me to get my hustle on, do it for profilin
Do it for the love affair because I`m lovin it

Runnin it all into the ground, doin it for days
Do it for money, know I gotta keep my bills paid!

Used to fuck the same hoes, wear Jeff clothes

Put the whammy on the whoop, be on the lookout
For the state troop, might shoot, durin the drug deal
Flippin at the mouth
Voluntarily raps your motherfuckin' folkers out
Tight about since Little League, Boy Scouts
Paper route dropped a diamond get some day skunk
I'm uh, I'm ooh cranky, booty like a old hag
She gonna get hella stanky if youse get teared up
But us niggas don't bring me back
My motherfuckin' duffle bag I squinges off the hinges

Didn't let me up in the Club Cafe Echelon and go to flashin'
Dopefiend ran off with a hundred count of my teeth
And I'm flashed
Big Willie cashed my hawkin money water so I took it to Scottie's
To keep myself from flashin'
Bought $250 worth of liquor and they tried to charge me

Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop
or a beauty saloon, since he come to be the biggest tycoon
with methamphetamine laughs and heroin balloons

Six po-lice pulled me over laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dopefiend beats
Two white boy groupies, mad as hell

Used my niggaz gold ropes and his Cadillac
I was broke to start with, didn't give a fuck
Couldn't tell me Short Dawg wasn't comin up

It makes you feel good, like when you bust a nut
Now I'm a millionaire, and can't get enough
Forty tell em how it is (way too tough Short Dawg)

When I first started rappin motherfuckers would cap!
""That nigga fake he sound like Woody Pecker on crack (ha ha ha HA ha)""
Niggaz would laugh and say I rap too fast way back then
But now I be catchin all kind of motherfuckers
tryin to sneak my little old style in
And that's a compliment, cause I ain't trippin on the money
(what about the money what about the money)
Ask me, sheeit, I think there's enough money up in this bitch

And I`m tryin` to stick my ding-a-ling 
Between one of these super badass bitches

With a gas leak radiator off the heater reads
I`m in a desperate need of some antifreeze

Six months behind on my mortgage, house under foreclosure

Drug dealin', leelin' and dealin' tryin' to make a million
Blood spillin', driveby walk up to that nigga peel him

But it don't show
'Cause all I heard from your mouth
Was ""fuck that ho.""

But deep down inside I know it hurts a lot
I know you can't go on but it's worse to stop
You daydreamin 'bout your x, tryin to figure what's next
Other females can't compare to her sex

I'm tryin' to picture me, all in love with these hoes
But when I meet 'em, they just want to lick my balls
You can't tell me shit, fuck that
You're just another fine ass bitch with nut breath

I met you on friday, I fucked you on saturday
I can't hold back bitch I'm still rollin' that way

Pimped-out all day you know Hillside Vallejo nigga
You undersmell me? Been speakin' the real for many moons
My niggaz in the 7 0 7 on down to Compton

I'm in my Fubu drawers, she in her gown
'Cause if some cats tryin' to have at me
I sick the canine in the background
I'm plannin' on splittin' my crown but it ain't gon' be too simple

See I'm a baller, I got bars around the window
Rottweilers, pits, aikietas, doberman pischers tanked up in the yard
With a sign on the fence that reads, ""Warning: Beware Of Dog""
You play the frog if you feel froggish nigga leap

I neglect my dogs, starvin', sometimes they don't eat
Elroy speak to me about my triple-beam, officer, I got proof
Po'-po', that's for weighin' nuts and fruits
Run wit' a whole bunch of rugged rowdy-ass knuckleheads
KnowhatImean?

Big nigga, the size of a football team
I wear these glasses so that I can look like a square
But if you ever see me in a fight with a bear
Don't help me nigga, help the bear

Me and my wales, we be coonin'
But see you the type of the nigga
That'll go in the backroom
And beep yo'self and act like yo' pager boomin'

Yeah man, 'cause a real tycoon
Gon' take this shit from the flo' to the moon
Still Northstar ridin', six-oh strikin'
Switch up V-S cherry chokin' the wrist and the pinkie

But keep it loose around the neck and make sure hoes in check
So if you gon' fill a nigga cup, fill it up with paper
'Cause we ballaholics bitch, ain't that quiet about this shit
If you're on it spend it like you mean it

Uhh, I'll have you
Ever since I was ankle low to a centipede's claw
I always wanted to play pro-baseball
Weepolization family, that's my favorite sport

But instead I'm back and forth to jail and in and out of court
Bitch, serious about my rock shrine
I don't give a fuck, how much courage juice you had
Nigga yo' mug don't mean like mine

I bring the noise like a cymbal
I fuck with 40 dem, make you stick your pistol out the window
Bitch, y'all oughta see me at the state fair
Showin' off in front of my broad, tryin' to win my lil' nieces

One of the biggest stuffed animal prizes there
Nicknamed Charlie but my street name is Earl
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell nephew Lil' Darrell
I know these streets like the Task Force know dope

I am the streets, my ghetto pass can't be revoked
Ten percent, I paid my tithes, forgive me for my sins
Smoke an ounce of weed a day
Maybe that's why I ain't go no ends

You see, you niggaz real truant mayne
Runnin' around here puttin' a black eye in the game
When we tryin' to feed y'all somethin' nutritional for the brain
And nourish yo' game

You see there's two type of niggaz in this world
Those that eat and those that don't
What type of nigga is you, you know? You see we got the tycoon status
Big hogs, tryin to pile the money up out your trash, you dig?

You can call me, Lawry's 'cause I'm seasoned
I eat crevice, but not when it's bleeding
Don't get me wrong, I love sex but I don't play that part
I love Virginia, but not when the Virginia's tart

Toss me good, and I might Dolce and Gabbana it
Gave yo' ass some bread, and let you go buy up some shit
Callin' yourself takin' advantage of my riches
I'm tryin' to be nice to yo' ass, I normally talk bad about you bitches

Invested to ""Tha Hall of Game"" buggin' and bein' notorious
For slappin' chickenheads upside they weave-a with my Nokia
Mayday mayday, callin' all patrol cars and units
Be on the lookout for the Hillside managler, 40-Water the Ballaholic

I'd rather fly than ride Amtrak
When I'm in Dallas I fuck with [Incomprehensible], and go hard black
Make an opera singer wanna write some raps
Papered up, like who? Like a fax, bitch

I know you didn't say papered up like a fats
Yeah, 'cause we do this shit
Up off the ground on a pitcher's mound
Slidin', to the bad catcher, able to snatch ya

Bat yo' G out the pocket
Run it again with a nigga that's in the socket
And it ain't my problem, if the hoe hollerin'

Pulled out his lead and aimed it fo' my head

I come from where they pop they collars
And couldn't be saved by Creflo Dollar
'Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates
At the rate I'm goin' now, it'll be too late

Take life taste it, get on and smell it
You know what Charlie is, well it's sucker repellent
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib

Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac escalate
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin' off that num-num juice

I'm in the traffic with my music on storm
Got a ticket just for blowin' my, horn
The real, pinkie ring, princess cut
Carats on, around my neck

Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy
Hoes'll dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome

Use the dope game as a steppin' stone

So many record haters, my back against the wall
When I was growin' up I seen a lot of rappers ball

Bring the yellow tape, it's on, on sight
You wanna squash the funk? Shoot me a peace kite
Where the party at? Who got that Carlos Rossi?
Who in my drinkin' club? Girl I'm 'bout to mob somebody

'Cause you rap sa' hoe, I ain't even tryin' to entertain that

See I dip in mo' holes than a golf ball
Pussy fallin' all out of my Granada
Squabs in Kansas City, squabs in Colorado
Learned how to pop my collar in the city where they shot The Mack
Dem were some of the players that helped tie my shoes and lace me
Name was Curtis and B.O.

I see more killings and more hop than the kangaroo
My baby's momma she sick, she on that glass dick
Be crawlin' all on the rug lookin' for that shit

Hogan High School prom queen right?
On her hands and knees pickin' up lint and anything that's white
That's how you can tell that a dope fiend's gone psycho
When they get to hah lookin' all out the curtains with they high beams

On the corner, be that dice game unfoldin'
(What happened?)
One of my dudes, seriously, he rollin'
Then a couple of fools pull up and went for theirs a-course
With intentions of splittin' my wig but it wound up gettin' reversed

I left they kite flyin', down for the grind, witnesses dissolve

It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow

And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen

Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution

Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that

There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, ""Who's sack is dat?""
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one

I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution

Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport

Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath

On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong

Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then

I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen

Poppin' wheelies in my brand new ride

If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook

Power heated side through mirrors, brought back airbags
Off the new with the stump
My Cadillac DTS Deville, 32 valve ain't no punk

Get up outta here some ol' Jacklin and square
Hollered adjitudes and ate the gravel
I said, ?I ain't no mark ass any ol' rapper
Potnah I was built for battlin'

And about all that ol' jaw jackin'
You doin' potnah, I ain't playin'
You get your head put on flat,
Think it's a game, I got choppers

Done fucked with jelly jaws
Screwed a few bitches in my car
A temper problem, I can't hide
Issues, violence, problems deep inside?

Although them niggaz is tight
As tight as me they never will be
So what? Some niggaz is famous man
Some niggaz is out for they G's

Some niggaz is lovin' hookers man
Some niggaz send hoes to they knees
Some niggaz will rescue a bitch
Some skanless niggaz'll let the ho bleed

If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

To whom this may concern
All you rappers with all that fetti to burn
The industry is finicky so let me make this clear
THEY'LL HAVE A NEW NIGGA NEXT YEAR!!

I know you're shinin like a light
I know your record sales is politics and hype
I know you're boohoo'n
'Cause none of your royalty statements never had a check attached to 'em

Famous but unrecouped; circumstances predicated on
Large-ass video budgets, and takin out advancements
Uhh, March and September, that's quite a ways 40 - 40?
Oh he get paid every thirty days shorty!

Uhh, I ain't no lame
I'm different from why'all, I come from the game
(From the game) I ain't gotta explain
I been hella raw, I been spittin game

I seen you on the Billboard
I saw you when you got that MTV Award
Uh, number one on SoundScan
Congratulations playa; dude can I shake yo' hand?

Oh you don't want to shake my hand, now you too good now?
Oh it's like that you 'sidin on yo' folks now?
Enjoy it while you're here..

But I ain't finsta sit down (sit down)
Sit down and wait for this shit to come back around
Shit I just like to perk (whatchu like to do?)
I like to get out there and network

Charlie Hustle fall off? I doubt it
Shit, when niggaz stop talkin about me
That's when I'm gon' WORRY about it
And if they do I'ma take the independent road

A hundred thousand units on the underground; 
Playboy, that's ghetto gold!
Never breakin a sweat (a, a sweat)
Slangin albums from the internet (from the internet)

My loyal fans want to know why it's so noticeable
And how come none of E-40 lyrics 
Ain't never been in The Source 'Hip-Hop Quotable'?
To tell the truth it's kinda irkin me, cause I don't know

I ain't rappin too fast, see why'all just listenin too slow
You can ask +Zomba+ I'm about a thousand songs deep
Spittin ghetto anthems that I done had
I should of been ran out of heat (ran out of heat)

I had to prove myself first
I didn't get my deal based on a sixteen measure verse
Uhh, damn right and ever since dude 'Pac passed away
The West coast ain't been eatin right

If he was alive I'd ask him for his opinionation
And if he was me what would he do in this sort of situation
Would he take off on these journalists, tell me what you think
For assassinating motherfuckers characters with all that bad ink?

How they gonna have me Top 50, #43?
I'm a hog, shit; that's why I don't fuck with Blaze

And take a look at what these fakers call real

I trust no man, 
'Cause man will let you down every time 
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme 
'Cause I've seen better times 
And I've seen worser days 
When some of my so called friends 
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say 
I quench my thirst today 
With righteous thoughts of mine 
'Cause righteous thought of mine will leave mark ass niggas far behind 
I seen it every time 
They come and go 
That's why I drop to my knees 
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe 
And what do you know 
By the time morning comes I can see the light 
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right 
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene 
Countin' greens 
Straight from H-town to New Orleans

I'm tryin' to tell you my nigga to watch cha back 
And trust few 
Cause ain't no nigga goin' watch ya back for you like you 
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough 
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust 
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make 
Don't want no bustas around me 
Playa hatin' or actin' fake 
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get to close 
I don't know if it's effects of 
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin'
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot 
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone? 
See, my partners who used to ride with me 
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes 
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll? 
Maybe they will, maybe they won't 
Who is to say what a nigga will do 
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help 
You 
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this 
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends 
Now all of a sudden I'm actin' funny because my moneys loaned 
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home 
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin' you don't already know

I'm thinking about hard times 
Freeing my mind 
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch? 
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out 
Makin' sure that I stay in touch 
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to? 
When I be low on my cash 
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass? 
Who is my friends who is my foes? 
Who do I ask, when I want to know 
Somethin' about somethin' but I don't know nothin' 
My ignorance be keepin' me out in the cold 
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride? 
In somebody elses car

Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin' to lean 
Know what I mean? 
When I be needin' some justification 
Stuck in the fuckin' same location 
Who is the friend that is helpin' me? 
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me? 
Who can I trust? 
Will you be there when the goin' is tough? 
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust? 
Who want to share my load when it's too heavy to carry? 
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone? 
Constantly gettin' my hustle on

Big bread, big spread, big scratch,big cars, turf hogs, Cadillacs

Watchout ersky perky it's seldom you see me thirsty
Gatorade bottle full of Burgundy Carlos Rossy
Lift yo head high, we might take you up out yo body
Me and my mossy motherfuckers life of the party
Give it to me baby you know what I'm lookin fo'
A super ghetto hoe, big ol' ass like J-Lo
Club packed, like a Detroit hair show
Dug that, she can teach the wind how to blow
She can teach frosty how to snow, right, glow
In the dark lay, night, fireworks, sparklight, ALL-night
Ride her like Olympic style tour de' france bike
Brand new upholstery, flambostly out wit the fellas
In the hotel lobby wit honey gettin jealous
Ain't nobody trippin', but patna, he outta line
Spray myself with sucker-repellent pulled out my nine

[Chorus x2]

I got a shortage of supply and demand when its drought
Buy low, sell high, my marble route
Know about the weather before its about to change
My repo, they distribute, they repo be drivin planes
Watch out for them folks and them K-9's sniffin them thangs
Bricks, kicks, hittin MC's and door panels man
I run my game from Frisco to Maine, pimpin long range
Fast quarter fuck a slow nickel that's chump change
Place your order, high yellow jazzy, light bright and almost like
Chocolate trailer trashy mcnasty throw away but now she's classy
'cause her sugar daddy done put her up in the sink
Washed her up got her dressed in hot pink in mink

[Chorus x2]

Gotta ride on vogues when we fly by
Underlay ??? Bonita bye bye
Mustard and mayonnaise smokin up at the sky light
You can't touch my vogues baby bye bye..

And I'm fucked up, and I'm fucked up

A playa's sweating, shoot dice up under the staircase
Talking hell-a-loud grabbing his balls and side betting like a veteran
All my weeples just come hard, reach into my pockets
Pulled out a wad of money and I threw my dogs up on it

It's expected, cause way back when I couldn't afford
When a playa like me was leaking, had my back like a ? board
Now that I'm eating, the game done blessed me mayn
Everyday is my birthday, I'm about that ice cream and cake

Looking for a batch with no pan and
I'm a guerilla meals must like Brandy

But a fool, can you do the other side of the pimp

Stick and move, all about my uh paper route

You got a house that's sold out full of bitches

Know I'm coming cause I walk with a limp and
Step to the ladder like a playa now I'm pimping
Never gabbles in a hoe and come up with it

Then I suggest you go with ya gut, don't ignore your first mind
Always pay attention to your warning signs
Always be awoke, always be aware, always look over ya shoulder
Always be alert of the rollers

Yea

The thought's all wrong when it comes to this north side (north side)

May God Bless
Who am I? Mr. Ski, apply pressure
The 40 Water call mi ""ski"" (hey)
The most aggressive

I was raised up where we say ""blood"" and ""'cause""
Gang bang, slang cane
Breed killas and thugs
I gave up sports, and started sellin' drugs
Use to be a car thief
But now I spendin' love to bars
I'm a star, I was born one (born one)
My jersey is throw back
But never toss my gun
The task force hit the dock
My moms got stopped, ironic
And rep East O
But not from New York son
I get money like Suge, Master P, and Russell
And build up my franchise 'cause since the money is muscle
I fuck wit the switch in the front before
And everybody says ""fo' sheezy""
But where my credit go?

Northern Califoolya game
We've all been properly introduced
To uphold this yay mane
'cause if we don't check it from the womb
We gon' check it from the balloon
Still serve in mind
I'm pushin' the number one tea spoon
Northern Califoolya playin'
Mac's, pimp's, and ho slayers
Were made sharper than the Gillette blue blade straight out the pack
'cause Northern Califoolya's the snake
To start the strike
Clear folks and judges up have plenty of this light
So don't get caught up goin' to the spoon by noon
Ya dig?
Because you'll be missin' that coochie
'cause you be on yo way to the bitter hoochie",Northern Califoolya,2003

Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats
Good game cash, I stash the store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches
Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires
Hundred spokes wide
With armoral baby wipes cause my baby drink wine
Nothing but the best on the flesh, just like sex
Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus
I don't see no ring all I see is miss 60 jeans
Walking through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle, got 40 smelling like skunk

You kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray

Huggin' the block just me and my mini-me

Cops fillin' wit' my projects find it yeah

Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone
And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome

It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a Lord Jesus perm
When my name was earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls

E-40,"Speculation has it, that I'm the freakiest one 
I like to rip out my tongue and spit the black magic 
And I'm supposed to be fucking some crack addict without a rubber? 
And I already got a baby by her mother? 
They say I'm a sci-fi wizard of sorts 
And my momma, she was a banshee, she was drowned by the courts 
They say my little brother Jamie, he's dead and in a grave, and I'm all alone and afraid 
And everything I gave has been so underestimated, I've been hated by generations 
For having conversations with people who didn't make it 
How could I fake it? 
I'm a monster, remember me? The weirdo with the axe, from another galaxy 
I keep a blender in my kitchen filled to rim with the blood 
And spit suspicions of me drinking it up 
So it's fucked, scatter stones, get out my cool-Aid 
I'm blasting away from all you haters 
Hit me up on my two-way 

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
Besides some bullshit falling down 
I'm okay 

Speculation has it that I'm a drunk and a drug addict 
A shit talker, always trying to start static 
A borderline faggot, with long fingernails 
Either that or he's a coke head, but I don't think he cares 
Speculation has it that I have already engaged in sexually fantasies with me and Gwen Stefani 
A video taping, internet downloads 
Speculations is called is the one who gets boned 
I can't escape it, mistake it, or fake it out 
Look you in the face as if I don't know what you talking about 
Speculation, you heard I don't spit on no bodies shit, but no, don't hate me 
Many mouths to feed, and many personalities, and me looking to get P.A.I.D 
Is it a lie or is it true? 
You can put that on our skills they stay snug like my Batman suit

Smash the flash I have the plastic backing 
Speculation, hateration, me and Twiztid don't give a
Mistaking, papered up, smashing independently 
With a dedicated ass fanbase, and don't a mothafucka hear from me 
Speculation, see they just don't know 
I be rapping too fast, they be listening too slow 
I be spitting sluggish 
E-40 be spitting thuggish 
E-40 be representing the bottery up in the cop, got the dirt popping 
Ain't no stopping a pimp 
Walk with a limp 
Elbows on bimp 
Flopping on hips 
Sipping on sip, sipping on sip 
Dipping and skating and bounce to this shit 
Me and Twiztid be twisted 
Me and Twiztid be gone 
Me and Twiztid be blisted 
Me and Twiztid be stoned 
Gone on our head, dead, dead wrong

Maybe he sits and smokes a bong.",What If,2004

I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky 
Again and again, they say when will it end? 
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it 
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets 
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that 
For the right scratch, I be the last mack 
So stick yaself Pretty Tony 
You tryin ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony 
Not like AT&T but like ET 
You can't be me, so would you please see 
If you can keep my name out your mouth 
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about 
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz 
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head 
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick 
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick 
Bitch!

E-40,"[Chorus: P. Dot]
When them guns goes off, we be ready for war
When them guns goes off, bitches hit the floor
When them guns goes off, and them sirens roar
Better get that money, and be out the door

[W.C.]
Racket, racket, comin' out of the back end
Dead at you, he throwin' the hot lead at you
Swang affiliate, X.O. sip, a gold getter
With the rest to gather, my cold killer
It's ""Me Against the World"" like 2Pac
And like Biggie, I'm ""Ready to Die"" for what you got
Got a crew with killas behind me, I'm grimey
I'm one of the big body, blowin' cushions where you can find me
For figures, we bust triggers, who could fuck with us?
Dub, E-40, Christ Bearer, plus RZA
Stick you with the Blade, we gots to get paid
And for the moolah, we intertwine like French braids
And I can't fight the feeling like one way
When it comes down to this gangsta shit and gun play
For the loot, we compute it, quick to shoot it
So hit the switch, punk blew it, and bang the music

[Hook: P. Dot (The Reverend William Black)]
I don't care what it takes, we gon' make it
They say the chains too strong for us to break it
Willing to do what it takes for us to make it
And we can overcome anything we faced with
(We are soldiers after all, down by honor we won't fall
After all, all, all, all, all....)

[Christ Bearer]
When them guns go off, bitches hit the floor
Or then forty four slugs gonna hit you, ho
I don't care what it takes, I pull out a gear
Fuck the snakes, and Kurtis Blow with The Breaks off
Artie Murphy and the Petty Coat Junction
Get two thirty off the head with cold dumplings
Niggaz jump when the AK bark
Crystal grip pump, make the gun niggaz spark
You dig? Niggaz ready for war
Been carryin' the world for so long, it ain't heavy no more
And even when the sirens roar, I taught the violence gore to start firing more
And when we run out of bullets, and you still want static?
I grab the three eighty and pull out the automatic
We better get the money, for shootin' Mossbergs and Beretta's
Niggaz ain't shit funny, when it comes to a brawl
Suckin' Northstar, trippin' in
Guns go off, why'all know why'all strippin'

[E-40]
Look out peon, we might of lost the battle, but we won the war
I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

Said my voice was too squeaky and my style was a disgrace
Now I'm hittin', they ain't laughin' all the way to the bank
Making deposits and promoting my own track
Backing with my nose in the air, like my shit don't stank

Gimme head till I'm deader than a fuckin Doorknob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana pealin'
Her throat game platinum worth a million
Put her on a track we can make a killin'
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring big lips and breasts
Extasy, Hennesy
Broccoli, the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
I'm hard like I'm out the penetentary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my niggs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deepthroat contest you and your friends

Pull it out your mouth now its time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face in your hair all over the sheets

My goons take no prisoners, what fool?
What's beef? Beef is when E-40 on a fat verse
Swing 'em in the drive through, smashed up further

Gettin' off, if you from the Yay, that's North
Open up the do's, go, four on low
Four-fo' heat sick, monkey on my back
Psychos all on milk, won't let me go

Down my throat, yes, 'cause, buzz
What, I, go, numb
Slack hoes like Droop-E's
Put in thumb, run it back like Rick on the NPC, go hard

Hammer on my waist, Tim the Toolman Taylor
Get rich, hate bein' po'
Cause my bitch keep askin' for juicy couture

In the club, you know we strapped up
My white tee shirt look like coke wrapped up
Forces and jeans, can't wear slacks
Got good hair, no wave cap

This whole block, standin' on the curb
Same niggaz with me I been knowin' since the 3rd
Tryin' to get it, sucks bein' bummy
Never shoulda gave you niggaz money

Bop be's, rock see's, drop H's
Grind more than Haitians or Jamaicans
Ain't about money then ain't got patience
Don't bring money then don't have relations

Some like Hannibal, I'm a mammal
Ain't with monkeys like Mike and Emmanuel
Change the channel, rearrange panels
Oh-seven like the perm on cavi

Your bitch babby, she don't bring patties
She can't ride shotgun in the Brougham Caddy
Put my nigga in, let him campaign
And don't cut him off like Jay did Dane

BME, Warner Brothers, the machinery
Ooh, look out pimp
Heavy on the grindin' entertainment
Stovetop productions

Ooh, hustlers are us
My game sharper than an elephant's tusk
Me, myself and I the only that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open finger on the pistol clutch

I got my hands and everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come and don't need no bitch potential
When I was comin' up there certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails and men arching they eyebrows

Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin' became cool? I dunno
Gamed up I be chewin' on this mack granite
OG Jay be stomped that laced that niggas posted never can

I brought the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece just by my manipulation

They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some ikeas

Ooh, just tryna get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it bare-faced instead of ski masks

Ooh, no more talking on them cells
I heard the federal went ahead and bought Nextels, what?
Ooh, over crowded jails
They got us sleepin' in the gym instead of our own cells

Ooh, put our yeti together

E-40,"[female singer - repeat in background]
I'm just happy to be here!

[E-40 over singer]
Hard times, the struggle
The ups and downs, the highs and the lows
You know just goin through it man, ghetto politics
Tryin to make a way out of no way
I was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family
Momma had to work three jobs, oooh

Feet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers
Garage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls
No dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain
Colored folks think that castor oil cures everythang
Pork chops and chicken, we like our food fried
Hypertension, Prenavil pills and hydro-chlorizide
Some of my family still living, some of my family died
Health complications, natural causes and homicide
Just tryin to survive, nothin to lose but plenty to gain
Started hustlin, flea flickin and servin that candy cane
Put all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should
She had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood
While I was in the hood, up to no good
With a hoodie over my head, tryin to outslick the feds
Or should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks
Went from a little a jelly jar up to a soup pot
The fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel
I done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle
I done seen hella people relapse
I done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack
How sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures
Pray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures
Oooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead
God got my back but the devil he want my head

[Chorus: D.D. Artis]
I'm just happy to be here right now
Lot of my folks been locked up or laid down
See I'm sayin I ain't shed no tears, no
But I'm just happy to be here

[E-40]
Listen to this, oooooh
The devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it
Somebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement
Wrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime
Mistaken identity, bullets start flyin
In every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed
But her baby live through a see-section
I know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool
But it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin down a move
We heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same
Our parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang
I be high like an airplane
I be smokin and perkin, takin out anger and stress on the wrong person
Re-uppin and coppin turf an' just servin the soil block
Grittin tryin to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'
Ooooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear
For the homies that never made it and family that ain't here

[Chorus]

[D.D. Artis]
So happy
You know I'm happy to be
Said I'm happy, so happy just to be here
To beeeeeee, to beeeeeeeeeeee

Blazin' the block, sellin' that hot
Slickin' the cops, pushin' that rock
Totin' them chops, open up shop
Punchin' the clock, pistols cocked
Havin' my change, drivin' a Range
Switchin' the lanes, hyphy train
Claim to fame, makin' a name
Deep in the game, what set you claim

Yup and when he come home he smell like liquor and fish
Fool don't know what he missin, he tardy and lame

You got a mean throat game and your coochie is serious
Pussy so good I fuck you on your peroid

So of course they hated after you told 'em how I ate it
And you know what they say about fellas with big feet
So why you wanna put my business out in the street?
They already give me extra long hugs and shit (what else)
They want your position, they tryin to scoot you up out of it
Take your foot of the gas, I thought we had an arrangement
You missin the point, it ain't gon' be no engagement
You need to play your position, or you out of the game
You testin my mackin, you out of yo' range
We just fuck-buddies, I'm just stickin and bonin ya
Get somewhere with that dumb shit, stick to the formula
I'll come over later when your kids asleep
And so some nasty things that they gon' have to bleep

A stingy nigga, watch every penny that I spend
Go to any hood in the world and fit right in
A young nigga, with an old soul
A busy nigga, put the President on hold
Ride Vogues, 26 inch toes
Got the inside of the laws smokin like broke stogs
You can find me in the mall, buyin up all the clothes
Or in A-T-L or Club 112, throwin them 'bows
Left and right arms froze, cold like the ice from the cooler
Just left the jeweler, rose gold, Frank Mueller
I smoke big, growin weed in my garage
Police roll up, I got a cannabis card

I don't be slackin in my mackin, I be doin it in a player fashion
Makin it happen, speakers slappin, scootin and skatin and Cadillac'n
I be, representin my region and pullin up in somethin decent
Used to buy shit off the lot, but now lately I've been leasin
Like the white man I've been thinkin, tryin to come up with a plan
How to spend this dope money, buy some houses and some land
Tryin to teach you niggaz somethin, tryin to lace you like a shoe
Buy a couple of big Celebrities pimpin it ain't gotta be brand new
I'm a boss about my shit, about the way I carry it
The way I wear my glasses low, the way I sport my toothpick
The way I pop it at a hoe, the way I utilize my mouth
The way I keep my fuckin blowover over at a relative's house
Beware of yo' surroundings, gotta handpick yo' cronies
Gotta be about your allowance, and X out all the phonies
Gotta watch out for them folks, gotta watch yo' conversations
Gotta be careful on the phones cause them folks might be taping

[Chorus]
(Aww shit, talk in pig latin, use the codes)
They might be taping
(Aww man, you think they taping?)
Gotta be careful on the phones cause them folks might be taping

I been in the traffic tryin to get it, I ain't got time to fuckin waste
My money's short like I'm slippin, I'm tryin to smack it up and flip it
I'm tryin to turn this thousand dollars into a quarter of a mill' ticket
Some of you suckers be lyin to kick it, but that ain't the fuckin way
Niggaz be sellin mo' wolf tickets than fake autographs on eBay
My orangutangs'll growl, with our upside down smile
We been doin it for a while, you can check my d-boy file
I be fuckin 'em up like this man, I be killin 'em off like that
Divin up in them hoes mayne and treatin them hoes like rats
Niggaz don't really know that I'm so sincere about this here
Niggaz don't really know that I got my name from drinkin beer
Do a cauliflowered ear, me and my muskateers
Come through with them choppers, let the lil' homey steer
I like to dress up in my doctors, camouflage my real career
But I'm really packin woppers, pistols rusty like Pam Grier

I wish a motherfucker would, I'm still livin my second childhood
My mentality, my frame of mind, all hood
I'm in the local booth with my nine, breakin down a backwood
Sippin on 40, drink cloud nine, try to get it while it's good
In the heart of the soil, in the middle of the paint, where it ain't
Where we park our cars on the grass, sell hop and push crank
Where the dopefiends dig in our tracks and siphon gas from our tanks
Where the biggest hypocrites in the church call themselves saints
I don't gossip like bitches I mind my own fuckin business
Dig yaper good money cause that sucker shit ain't nutritious
I don't be burnin no bridges I'm a loyalist 'bout my riches
Gumbo pots boil, good with the skillet like a chemist
Steady long like a female weave, cooler than antifreeze
Bust you in the toe like Eddie Murphy did DeLouise
Act like you know what I represent, bitch please
That powdered milk section 8 and that government cheese, hoe!

Them days of slangin' yay been finished, them days have been done ended
So far gone them days that I'm offended
Snitches can't speak my name till they get winded

Can't you tell there's been a switch made?
Now fellas decide that they wanna run and tell like in the fifth grade
But I'm too gone, young'n be clear
Even when you see me, I am not really there

And I ain't play fair wit' my eye on the enemy
Huggin' the block just me and my mini-me
Did it and lived it, grinded here
Cops fillin' wit' my projects find it yeah

Not only was I in the game, I was gifted in it
Served food to the fiends and we called 'em dinners
Put the raw wit' the fake out, mixed it in it

Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone

And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome
It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a lord Jesus perm
When my name was earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls

Open up that garage
It's a big fat car
With a big fat bow on top (on top)
It's a Bentley Coupe with the roof let back
Now shawty you know that?s hot

I'ma give her the keys
Now shawty sang it to me
And I'ma give her the keys

From a bucket to a Benz
A Benz to a Bentley
Down with me from the start
Got my back like a tank top
When I used to be on the block
She hid my rocks in her yacht
Got a special place in my heart
She knows how to play her part
Every time I look at you darling
I get a hard on
You sexy without your make up on
I wanna bone
Move you out the hood
I told you I would
I'm not phony
We both from the same place
Grew up on fried bologna
They say the opposites attract
But we gotta a lot in common
Behind every boss player is a boss woman
Imam fiend when it come to our cooking
You do your thing
Throw down like Paula Dean
Neck bones & collard greens

Born in the mud, raised in the trap
Down ass broad, never been a sap
If I ever need bail, went to jail, got popped
You'll be Johnny on the spot
You'll come and get me out
A loyalist, not just a friend to me
We was meant to be
We got chemistry
You like when I lay this pipe
Been around each other so long
They say we starting to look a like
Starting to think a like
Getting our money right
Fuss, fight, then make love all night
California king on a California queen

We make a good team

Everywhere I go they know turf

See no skeep falling off my jeans

Staring in my rear view cant slow down

Arrest me now

[Verse 1: E-40]
I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel
From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, ""40 Water, I just wanna be on""

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Game]
They say money makes the world go round
And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do
I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie

Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cuz on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thing
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand

How much you got in your budget
The more you buy the less it costs
I could front you a few off the side
As long as your ass don't double cross

You crossed a lot of raccoons
Get your cranium sawed off

Might as well wear a tampon
Might as well be a breezy

And a lazy hustler don't get bread

Let no grass grow under my feet

I'm gonna give it to you straight
I ain't gonna give it to you late

It's from the heart it ain't rehearsed
The world is full of associates
But very few friends
That wanna contribute nothing
But wanna help spend your ends

Think before you rock yo mouth
Park your tongue and lip
Watching who you talking round
Never know who you?re having dinner with

Ain't got nothing good to say
Don?t say nothing at all
That's what I was told
That's what I was taught when I was small

A lot of theses so called artists got too much
Talent
You should be getting? your money on
Instead of hating on the next man

It's lonely at the top
But it's next to crowed at the bottom
That's why I always keep my pistol cocked
In case I gotta stop 'em

Trunk full of slap
Hollering at em? back

Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks

Acting a fool making my presence known
I look at business face to face
Don't like to talk on phones

When I'm at a stop sign or a red light
I leave one car space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so I could have enough room to get outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
That's how I was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby
I'ma tell it like it is
Man I was hollering at my grand partner
He said 40 return phone calls and you'll keep your friends
Tell it like it is

You two faced ass mother fuckers
I didn't just help create my music mother fucker
I invented it
Everybody wanna know what the fuck mob music is

Dom p? (hell no!)
(this is that Carlos Santana champagne!)
Oh shit, Santana d-v-x? that's my joint!
(mine too, but a lot of these busters don't know about it)
Well let's tell these motherfuckers!

As a kid, I used to lay awake and think
When was Santana gonna make a drink?
But now I'm all grown and my dream came true
Santana champagne, from here to you
From the heart of napa valley and the guitar king
Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing
Yo it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandanna
I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana
What's the first name in cham, it's Carlos
And to that man I propose a toast
In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex
But now he's gettin' down with the d-v-x

Excuse me fellas!
Am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?
(that's right motherfucker! here, try it)
Alright aw shit!

I feel alive for the first time
Each sip hits my lips like a landmine
Without Carlos in my life I was livin' a lie
He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cries
He's a southwest, tie wearin' bolo champ
Comin' straight out the box with a bolo champ'
Yo he a beast with the sugar and yeast, mix it in pots
Like the way his release mixed jazz blues and pops
And the salsa fusion, he's lady's shoe producin'
Plus he teamed with rob Thomas for a music revolution
On the 7th day, it was said god rest
But on the 8th day he made the d-v-x

Gentlemen, gentlemen, what is all the hubbub about?
(Carlos Santana!) that's right
I see bitches-is enjoyin' my sparkling wine
(we certainly are) well be careful
Cause this shit'll get you fucked up
Bitch!

I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine
Santana d-v-x make you wanna have sex (ooh)
I'm rich bitch! I'm havin' my chips
Get laid all the time, by 70's chicks, uh
Won hella grammies, batches throw me they panties
I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in your mammy
I'm a bay boy, city life, been around the corner
Try to play me foul and my vatos goin' run up on ya
A legend, a boss, that's what I are
Ask about me pimp, 'tana be killin' the guitar
Old enough to know better but young enough to not care
I get active - might slap a bitch with my hair (whip)
Left coast up top I bang that shit
My sparkling wine'll pop crystal on her lip
Can't stop, won't stop gettin' my bread
Pack arenas and coliseums now watch me shred

Oh, san-tan-tan-tan-ah

A monkey drank a bottle and learned to speak
A squid drank a bottle and became a freak
A lion drank a bottle and forgot how to growl

A horse drank a bottle, and fucked a cow!",Santana DVX,2009

With my troubled past I can't even get me a job
My partner rap he got his own record label they doing their thang
If I holler at him maybe he can shoot me some change
Plus I'm a loyal nigger man, I learn quick bro I ain't stupid
All you gotta do is show me one time and I can do it
My fellow put a hustle under his wang, show me the game
Now I'm doing my thang

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back
I get it in the morning
Don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back
I get it in the morning

I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple 
This little change that I got
By throwing a few concerts
But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this mill' 
The reason why is rap shows don't always go that well
Uh, and the chances are that I probably won't recoup
So I'ma take this loot and book some old school R'n'B soul groups
That way the value insurance won't be that high
And plus I'm minimizing the chances of somebody dying, that's right
I got a homie that work at the toll bridge
He make good money, plus he get benefits
He been hollering at me never the lesson
Trying to get a nigger a job there which is a blessing
But I don't think the homie really understand
I am an entrepreneur man I ain't working for no white man
Attitude of a hood boy, all my life I've been running from the Elorys I'm serious

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that

E-40,"It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit
Straight west coasting, you can tell by my outfit
Red 'nati fitted, ""Blood in, Blood out"" shit
Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' the four though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin' logo

Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas they feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin'
Feeling like God's son, the way that it was written

Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I take two hits, and then I pass

I see the cops in the rear view, 
Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill
For real, I think my first album sold five mil'

And you say to yourself that he is broke 
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuittons 
And now that bitch is in the wind and after the next draft, 
She gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him, come again 'cause

[Chorus]

Daddy fat sex, my balls are on your chin, 
But can you tell me where my dick's at?
Gat or ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, 
I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me master
'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, 
We facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Stories and club songs
Black home, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian,
'Cause style's are being loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money while misleading the village

Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers

But I used to flee through that yellow white, yo right
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green
What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream
My nigga let me hit that there hemp, do your thing

Don't give me no more I'm on my second fifth of liquor
Once I'm power up it's hard for me to power down
I fuck a nigga up, and put tears on em like a clown
I went from rags to riches, riches to rags,
Top convertibles, Benzs and Jags
Smoking me herbal, sipping me wine,
Or should I say turbo 'cause it's green and it's lime
Ever since he was infant he was raised around pimps
When he took his first step, he walked with a limp
Man this nigga hard headed damn fool
His teacher sucked his dick in high school
Supercalifragilistic ex be ala hooligan
Breakin down the diesel mixing cookies with the headband
Went to jail on a Friday, didn't get out till Tuesday
Got a DUI for drinking too much lou, bitch

Now, I'm in jail for a crime, made bail and I paid the fine

Insurance, is going up, and when I go to court I know I'm fucked
All this shit, just for drinking
Need a designated driver, I'm to drunk for thinking
Two hands on the steering wheel
Don't let a friend drink and drive if you being real
Might crash the whip, might lose your life
If I get too high tonight just make sure
I making home safe and you do the same

And I'm all about pour drank up
While I'm rolling the stank up
Sweat my wife out her make up,
Blow a pound when I wake up,
See the cars they don't wanna race us
I do it big niggas do it A Cup
Walk up in the club then gonna bring some champagne
I'm a blow a lot of drugs, I put money on it,
Spendin all this bank let a fuck nigga hate
Real nigga show love sound funny don't it

Now when I walk in the room there's no choice but to love the boy
Gone for a minute time to fill the void

Been here quite some time so when I write these rhymes
I feel like I'm finna take flight

Where the real niggas from the Bay
I'm tired of broke rappers name dropping Mac Dre
Stop fronting, it makes no sense
If you ain't talking about money what you talking about pimp
Made my first million when I hit 22
Hoes still choosing even with the chipped tooth
My new work said she went to school with Su
I'm a real OG still doing what it do
Kingpin's coming home, youngsters don't care
They ain't never seen a real street millionaire
Like Short Dog, I'm still in the house bitch
50 thousand on the jewerly, 100 dollars on the outfit
They steady choosing you know it they love the macking
It's platinum on top of platinum I'm rapping they know it's happening
Young Su, 40 water what's up
That's why they wanna be like us

What's that, dividends
Bay area niggas been setting trends
I got more friends in the pen than I do in the streets
If it wasn't for my pen I'd locked up or deceased
I'm polished they wonder why I'm so wise
Got my game from the OGs, who is that, the older guys
I love the work that's all I know
(How was you raised?)
Raised in the mud hella poor, diabetic
Used to put lotion on my grandma's toe
Why, cause it had a hole in it
I rep that 707 it's either hell or it's heaven
Where I'ma go I don't know
Real I see a dove or a crow
Watching out for the rifle it's called survival
Where your hands at?

Most of y'all were chasin' around bops
Always in the lab, only hoping that my job
Never would be based around mops now I'm on

Skinny rich girls always askin' where the yay at
Throw a house party like cool, where you stay at?
Turn upside down, let her tweak on the wall

Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room

A flight to the top, cop a one-way
But looking out the window of the subway, 16, slapping Mac Dre
Somehow I always knew it'd be that way
I felt tit so clear it's like a rode a time machine and I saw it
I paint the picture and draw it, I fold it up in my wallet
Keep it with me everywhere I go just as a reminder
Told myself every time I get discouraged or tired
I got greatness inside of me
I go against the grain 'til they tired of me
I've heard it all, nothing surprises me

So I'ma do it in a major way
I said, I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today
From the Bay
Like 40 & Dre
Chasing dreams, it's the only way

I'm still here, remember these lyrics
And when I'm dead and gone, I'll be there in spirit
Don't let 'em run my name in the mud, don't let 'em smear it
Just pour some Rossi out, go ahead and tear it
One of a kind, no copy
Tell your grandchildren's children 'bout me
Tell 'em I was the illest
Let 'em know I spit the realest
Went from pennies and nickels to large amounts
Kept it in the hood, where it counts
Never was them, always was him
Had to prove myself, time and time again
Just when they thought it was it, he back with another hit
We brought the Bay to the rest of the world (who was it?)

Been trying to lift the Bay up, could probably curl it
I learn from the legends, they tell me ""you're it""
So I always maintain and try to stay sane
But, just do you, give a fuck what they sayin'
We artists are all alike, we feel the same pain
You want the whole world? We want the same thing

I'm tryna know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I'm to myself like the usual
But it ain't for you to know

But it ain't for you to know

Its kinda funny niggaz running up
Trying to show me much love
Cause a motherfucker just dropped an album
Now they wanna kiss ass
But hold up bitch all your getting is a luck pass
Trying to gank me for my ducket
I tried to put you down with the ski & cmt you said fuck it
Only came around when things was kinda cool
But did you really think I'd go out like a fucking fool
Oh hell no, I kept my shit tight
Now the ski & cmt is sitting on something right
Your like a gold digging bitch from the neighborhood
That's why I slide on your ass cause it makes me feel good
All this shit you talk when I'm not around
Get your crown on nigga but you still ain't down
I got something for ya'll
A nin-millimeter that will drop you to the floor bitch
Cause if I trust ya for a minute
You would have had a motherfucking knife in my back then bent it
I gotta get ya first
Cause a nigga like ? is the nigga that will fuck you the worst
Punk ass nigga kinda jocking now
You ain't down cause I trust nobody

One by one in this century
Brothers are dying getting killed
And sent to penitentary's
And your right hand man could have been a snitch
You think like a hoe you go out just like a bitch
So face 'em to the facts bro'
And end up dead like this other nigga I used to know
I guess it's kinda sad g
But it really didn't face me til the funeral car passed me
And what about them tagalongs
Them mother mother fuckers that are driving with the lights on
Could have been the killers
But nobody really cares he died on dope dealers
But that don't mean shit, cause a nigga like me pack a 9 and 3 clips
And I don't trust a soul from them nigga by my house
To them niggaz down by the store
When niggaz say they like me
That's the same motherfuckers in the game that tried to shice me
Mama say boy you have no friends, ha
I should have listened then
Dour niggaz rolled up with the ski-masks
Pointed the tech-nine out the window but they didn't blast
When niggaz said freeze p
I thought to myself, huh, this nigga knows me
But I didn't find it funny
Pulled out my motherfucking 9 when they asked me for my fucking money
But he didn't even shoot
He must have didn't have no bullets in the gun no time to think
I'm steady pullin' I blast for the driver to the passenger
Four niggaz dead in the car I laugh at ya
Now I gotta see, pull of the ski mask of this nigga that was calling me
I guess it's kinda sad, a tear rolled down my eye cause I knew his ass
His name was little peewe
That's the same motherfucking nigga I was trying to help g
Good thing I thinked fast, cause if I think a nigga gonna do me
I'm gonna do his ass, cause a bitch will get you killed
Niggaz like to steal, and ain't no thing is a good dope deal
So I live just like john montgotti, ha
I trust nobody

Yeah you know what I'm saying this goes out to all my niggaz out there
In the game you know what I'm saying
You gotta keep your eyes open you know, a lot of niggaz try to get
Niggaz, and the same nigga that you rolling with could be the nigga
Trying to get you, so a nigga like me you know what I'm saying
I trust nobody I hope you nigga catch on to what I'm saying

Peace. I'm outtie.

it's the niggas that be like quiet-like
It's the ones that put the slugs in your ass
and tell your ass goodnight
So get that nigga a marble coffin
'cause I ain't that nigga t' fuck with
I'm from the O so I blast often
Motherfuckers want to test my nuts and be like stuck

'Cause E-A-Ski's shot some shit up
Nigga, I thought you knew that it be on
Never leave the house without the chrome
Nigga you can fuck around and get your life took
Thinkin' I won't squeeze this fuckin' trigger
Till these bullets stop distributin'
Cut your ass on the late-night (ride)
Tryin' ta jack my shit, but my Glock is seventeen tight
Now ya bent outta shape from the tips, no talons
That I loaded in your ass by the gallons
Now then, why would you FUCK with a G?
I don't slang but I throw them thangs and shoot the Glock 20
Many ain't got their ass in to the C.P. banner
By a nigga that was well mannered
Now you're in for a treat, you don't want to meet my crew
We blast if we have to

Squeeze this motherfuckin' millimeter
And it won't stop

Shit, I cocked a '94 beamer, strapped with the Glock
I caught a '94 misdemeanor (That's fucked up)
They had my ass in the tank
With nothin' but motherfuckin' time to sit and think (Why?)
I had my shit in the first place
A black motherfucker in the O witta' beamer is the worst place
To be caught with the strap
A ten thousand bail and an infrared Glock I'll never get back
Can't fight the shit so I'm down for probation, waitin'
Two years and sixty days in a locked station
Can't fade the 6-0, so I chose the 2
And cut it down, I talk to the youth
Because they can't, I gotta file and some fingerprints
All because a nigga want to keep his motherfuckin' shit
Now ya see it ain't no love in this bitch
Strapped on the defense, pull it only when I need it
See these niggas want to play me for my earned shit
They ain't earned shit, they want to take, I gotta empty clips
These niggas ain't shit (I thought you knew, nigga?)
That's why my shit stay cocked, I blast if I have to

Motherfucker you can rap and try ta clown
Niggas ain't fucking wit you and your wacked sound
Who's the crew you want to fuck with? (The infrared)
Ai yo see, put the beam to this nigga's head
P.C.P. motherfucker, you lost a few screws
And these niggas don't know so I'm spreading the news
Player hater got my name in his mouth
If I shoot this 9 milli, I'm damn sure he'll wash my name out
Closet nigga can't cuff his nuts so he talk much shit
And be fucked when the Glock hit
I thought you knew that it be on like that
It ain't about the biggest gat, it's who's the first to bust a cap
These loco niggas ain't hearin' me
I give much love but have to blast if they fuck with me

And it don't quit, and it don't stop
Fool we don't quit

Side, high noon clock strikes twelve that's high

They must be sick in the head
They better be quick like Sharon Stone
And quicken their dead and quick on the draw
Western winds make the dirt gust

Don't follow nobodies shadow (none)

21 guns salute when I come through
Why you sell a million copies sounds like your crew
I roll like no man, follow no man
Spittin wicked over tracks, me and see programmed
Hard, I keep comin raw, 'cause I'm hungry

I bring it to the showdown

Makin hard tracks spittin no conversation 
Look here, ain't no rapper feelin conversate for me

So when you acknowledge me put the mister in the front 
Spell it right, M-I-S-T-E-are Ski 
Composin gangsta tracks with mister see since eighty-three
You proberly heard me on Friday with Cube and Chris Tucker
Blast, I break a slow dog runnin for cover
How would I sound makin tracks if I couldn't rap
Bompin them so hard, my dogs give me def wounds
I'm wanted in four cities, Miami, New York, L.A. and Oakland 
With leavin the mic court smokin
Kick open the door, at the saloon 
Don't nobody move unless they want to throw down, here at the showdown

And have your whole city high ride like George Steel
Fool you want the funk, we can bring it to the stage 
Face off like John Travltra and Nicolas Cage 
A lot of rappers calm east Oakland ain't frontin
Put them lyrically toe to toe to me and see who really run it 
And we haven't even gotta talk about the production tip 'cause on the real
None of them gonna quit
To handle my calibre this next level style combined me rhyme

But I had fifth of the game
But I knew that one day
That sooner or later it got to come back around

E-Maculet,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2005

E-Rotic,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool, playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here loses someone dear
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all

And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence",Winner Takes It All [Radio Edit],1997

Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he
Likes to play

In paradise
And one day you'll
Find out he
Wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angel eyes

I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought
I could never live without him

Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back
All the pain
How can I forget that name

I'm never at my peak, I'm killin' fifth after fifth
I drink mo' 40's than Tash and E-Swift

Uh, huh, I drink more than both of y'all
I hold more liquor than a bank on Crenshaw
And Tash you can't drink brew, you know you the nigga who
Be all on yo' nads after just a swig or two

Nigga you trippin', must be that Zima you was sippin'
Yo' accountant couldn't count how many bottles I be grippin'
And flip it in the trash 'cause I downed 'em with ease
While you on yo' knees
(About to pass somebody yo' keys)

I even had to pay the taxi the last time you asked me
You start off on yo' feet but always wind up on yo' back G
Bro you should know you can't drink with Rico
While you down yo' shit slow, I'm on my ninth Cuervo

Aiyyo at every single show, you be layin' on the flo'
Swearin' up and down, you neva' gonna drink no mo'
But I get to' up, from the flo' up, and never throw up
One little wine cooler and you wanna beat yo' hoe up

I never call it quits, I don't know my own limit

In front of the bar, that's where I stand
And to the alcohol for which I fall
And the cold porcelain in the bathroom stall

One drunk nation under God inebriated
With liberty and justice to anyone who's faded
Drink drink drunk until I can't hack it
Until the little man fall off the horse on my polo jacket

When I get drunk once again
I spent all my yen on ten bottles of gin
Likwit 'til I'm stiff, damn I love this riff
The Ro gotta go, I pass the mic to E-Swift

I drink a lot of beers, my life's a black version of 'Cheers'
Everyday sit at the bar and take shots with my peers
I've been doin' this for years, ain't no amateurs here
I've been drinkin' 40's longer than most niggaz careers

I've got the bitches grinnin' while the whole world is spinnin'
You suffer from double vision and I'm just beginnin'
You always pass out, wake up and don't remember me
You could write a book with all your hangover remedies

I thought you knew, I've been drinkin' since high school
While I down this Olde English, you sippin' your O'Douls
I'm makin' beer runs at ten minutes to two
While you still sippin' on your first motherfuckin' brew

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

They order three drinks but can't finish the first
I see 'em reachin' in they purse about to roll that sack of weed
Knowin' that's the combination that they really don't need

'Cause girls take a sip, get fucked up quick
Pass out, wake up

In the girl's bathroom, fucked up since ten

Yeah, I seen her, she thought she was a graceful ballerina
Now that ass is too drunk to drive herself to the marina
So she comin' home with me because, I don't give a fuck
Might fuck an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk

Walked through the flame with this pain in my eyes, that's all right cause I'm doubtless, I will survive. Why can't you just leave me be, why must you stand in my way. Now I wait, wait for the day, for you to see the light I see. Look at what you've done! If I took your life could I keep mine? Look at what you've done.



",Cycles,1999
E-Town Concrete,"Mirror, mirror, on the wall. Look at me, I can see it all. I went off, niggas turned soft, view from a coffin. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I lost my train of thought. Always on the E.T.A.C. and never on the defense. Defend yourself, motherfucker. It never used to be easy, but now it's falling into place. What never came around, now is coming my way. Straight up, straight from the streets and no fakin', I'm aching, what I see I'm taking. No time for napping, I don't believe in miracles, I'm making my shit happen. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. Hold me and lie to me, and tell me it will be ok. I won't hesitate to put a sucker on his fuckin' back. Peace to all the peeps who represent. The few that keep it true, we won't forget. It's time for some mother fuckin' action.



",End of the Rainbow,1999
E-Town Concrete,"Coming out of the woodwork, and here we go. On a steady climb to get mine, just so you know. Shots in the night cause two wrongs make a right. I got mad peeps, so I roll mad deep. ETAC's got my back, no need to worry kid. Never look back, never look back, I Repeat. Never look back, never fuckin' look back. Time to seed out the ones in which I could confide, from all the other suckas just along for the ride. Since the day one, I was a stray one, who was there for the other suckas just along for the ride. Since the day one, I was a stray one, who was there for there for me, no one see, and that's the way it will always be. Always an obstacle, but still you managed to succeed on your own with no help and two mouths to feed. Through all the fights in the middle of the night you still raised us right, and said, ""Never lose sight."" Red and blue sirens and do not cross signs, boy, those were some fucked up times. But now I put it in the back of my mind so I don't sweat it. I keep it in, but I will never regret it. Give me some room, gimme some room. You killed yourself for us, and eveayr night I watched you cry. You'd sit me down and tell me listen, ""He doesn't know what he is missing."" Constantly broke my heart and torn apart from the start. I had my head on straight. Life headed straight for the ground. Until you caught grip, and slowed that shit down. I had a dream, I dreamt the pain was gone. Headed left, right, right, left behind. Poisoned my world, grown man at the age of twelve. There's enough hate in my veins.

Niggas gonna be riding cock, and watch us knock their team off the top. Shut the fuck up, I grew up the fuckin' hard way. Where niggas don't play. Time to get mine become a star, shine, get paid. You got nothin' to say comin' from the top cause you got no desire. I'm comin' from the bottom, and all I want to do is reach higher and higher.

",Hold Up,1999
E-Town Concrete,"The future was bright, begin a new life. No more waking up at night from the fights at the bar across the street. Finally I can fuck in peace without my little brother sneaking peeks, it's deep. I'll miss punching holes in the walls when I'm upset. I'll miss arguing saying things that I regret. And yo, even though it was planned and we was set, I knew inside, it wasn't over yet. As his body deadens, her eyes redden, become puffed out and let one tear out to celebrate two years out. It's two years less I guess, moving back, losing everything got you stressed. It's kinda' sad though, we was on the map, and now we're going back. No fear I got your back, always forever, always. I got your back, I got this. Don't you worry, if things don't work out, (which they will) I'ma blow up still and pay off your bills. For real, I'll take these presidents, hit you off with something elegant - a house that's lovely - have you living plushy, sleeping comfortably, living way too dope to be having worries. I got this. The start of another ending. If you feel hate throw your hands up, if you ever felt pain throw your hands up. You gotta' maintain, step up and never fall back, keep it true through and through, and you can do that. Realize, open your eyes your best friends are you worst enemies ... sometimes.



",I Got This,1999
E-Town Concrete,"Stay focused son and it will be all right. Although I must admit life is trite but that's all right. Keep moving on and try to keep your mind occupied. No sense in stressing, though it hurts, memories won't die. A tear falls under a blood red sky. Close your eyes, if you want to die, True people represent when times get difficult. Think about who's looking out. No you can't tell me no. I grab what I can't have ... I take. I don't need your help. I knew it. I saw that shit way back when, things were different then, all the promises and such and such. I didn't know much. You thought. I don't need your help. I help myself kid.

E-Town Concrete,"So many nights I prayed 
That this would just stop, 
I woke out of my sleep from 
A sound of a popped lock 
My heart would drop to the ground 
Maybe the fact that my pops wasn't around 
Forced you to found these guys 
That would just knock you down 
Or beat you around. 

I don't know. 
My innocence was lost back then, 
Not to be found. 
And in a sense it's like this world 
Was just weighing me down, 
Leaning it's weight hard on my shoulders, 
Making my heart less warm and much more colder, 
A chip off my tooth and a chip on my shoulder. 

I told y'all that I don't play, 
I've seen that drama every goddamned day. 
So go ahead, yap away, 
'cause now you got a lot to say. 
Cast your judgements, 
Cast all your stones. 

Holding my hand, holding on 
To everything I have 
'cause it's slipping away so fast. 
I was like six then, 
We ain't have a pot to piss in, 
While most kids lives consist of shine 
And glisten, 
Mine was lined with mischief. 

A boy flipping, devoid of times 
You find joy in reminiscing. 
It's like time was missing, 
Years was passing, 
I was inside while kids 
Was outside laughing. 
No time for games, 
Their fake toy planes was crashing 
While me? 
My life was crashing. 

At night fist fights left 
My mom's face smashed in, 
Her ass blasted, 
Threw her down a flight of stairs, 
Alone and scared I stared 
At eyes of a man who didn't care, 
My father was never there. 
Now I am prepared for this lifetime that's unfair. This life I fight from the bottom to the top. 
This life I had to fight for all that I got. 
It hurts but I still won't stop till my casket drops.",So Many Nights,2003

Touch me one more time, I want to fly again.
Trusting in your hands to make me ride.
And my bodies shaking like a leaf in wind and rain
It?s the opposite of cold you need tonight

And I die a little every time we?re in the air
And I live a little more if this time we were there
You can lie a little if it takes us to the sky
Make me fly and maybe make me feel alive
Make us high,
Make us high, 

Every part of me is ready for your lips (for your lips)
Naked with the mission to excite
Give me shivers down my spine just from your finger tips
Make your fantasies reality tonight

And I die a little every time we?re in the air
And I live a little more if this time we were there
You can lie a little if it takes us to the sky
Make me fly and maybe make me feel alive
Make us high
Make us high
Make us hiiigh

Perché non dormi perché sei qui
Perché non parti per un week-end

Forse sarebbe meglio così

Che ti apre una via
E la tieni con te o ne segui la scia

Tutti sommersi non solo tu

His memories all curled up inside
He was trying to remember
Was it August or September
He'd seen her for the last time

He'd heard that she'd become an actress
Lord, she always had the prettiest face
And he stood with his hands
In his pockets and waited
For the dollar matinee

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

The theater, she smelled so familiar
She was a smokey old velvet delight
Yes, and he sat down front
Just like he'd always done
With his feet hanging out in the aisles

And he watched her with eyes disbelieving
Felt something like time on his brain
And he told himself
Don't you remember it's only
Just a part that she's playing

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

She stood by some window in Paris
While the captions translated the scene
Oh, and Ronnie stared back
At her body and breathed
""Christ, that's the first time I've seen it!""

Behind him the people were leaving
Well, the busses, they were humming outside
But old Ronnie never went
To the movies unless
He could stay and see it twice

E.D.I.,"Suge Shot Me
In today's music news: the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipe out in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact 'cause of the new album;
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is,
Why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment
But released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money,
Riders and punks. Which side are you on?

These niggas is still fuckin' talkin?
You niggas still breathin? fuckin' roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches

(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga! Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit, bring it!

Allow me to introduce first Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qu'Ran
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggas duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down.. to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon' cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
(Ha ha ha)

Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin' right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I wont rest till my road dawgs free, bomb first!

We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days and some many ways we've been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nothin' to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfuckin' cash mayne
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first biatch!

Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin
Yer tellin' fairy tales dunn
""King of New York,"" like you the motherfuckin one?
But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to Newark Bricks, all my niggas flippin chips
Gettin' rich, even though it's hard
Tryin' to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolv'
With no warnin' signs, 'cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin'
Don't want to hear no shit this evenin', believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggas on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first

E.D.I.,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty, it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose, they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggas fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there could never be peace

Somebody owes me, will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, after time, after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgiving, we thankful, just for livin' in hell
Damn, homey, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart, never

The only peace, we got, is the peace of our heart
Peace of our mind, or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh

So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace, never
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

Thangs is changin', nigga you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me, there's a part that wants nothin' but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin' for it and in the ghetto
They cryin' for it, but fuck peace

And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin'?
You muh'fuckers are smilin' but I'm mean muggin'
Why, 'cause I gotta be thuggin'

It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass, motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood?
And you at the funeral every muh'fuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you muh'fuckers talkin' about peace
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, muh'fuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings, muh'fuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace, we can't never have peace

Till you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped

E.G. Daily,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years

Any different than the details of the private records of our lives

Switching lanes on swinging thangs, that's called swang and bang

You got candy rims and beat, then you got you a slab
You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab
Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind
You making money looking good, then you showing your behind
You blow endo that's do-do, screwed up means slow mo

(This year) I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame
Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name
(Down here) it ain't no telling when you talking bout us
Got rocks in both ears, 'cause that shit is a must
(Down here) we break hearts and leave punks for dead
We don't claim the blue or red, 'cause our city is FED
(Down here) I'm better known as Lil' Keke the Don
Getting rich and going hard, to get it all for my son

[Chorus: x2]",Down Here,2001
E.S.G.,"Yeah, this what I do when I roll with a thug
Or a gangsta...

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Baby take my advice, I'll lead you right
You need a thug in your life, that can hit it all night
I'll make sure we live laid, and keep the bills paid
You ain't gotta work, just be my personal maid
I don't want much but a bad bitch, that cook and clean
While I'm out in these streets, trying to look for green

Boss Hoggs hit the scene, we finally made it
Now some women strip, and some uneducated
But thanks to having cake, we done got our breaks
Affiliated with the streets, lifestyle ain't fake
Don't hate congratulate, while we demonstrate pimping
I ain't racist but I love to fuck, our black women
E.S.G. and I'm winning, yeah the Boss man's back
Turning heads while I spread, through your shit like anthrax
Sit that ass fat, call E and Slim them
Peanut butter Gucci brims, on them keep-spinning rims

I'm rolling, with a thug and a gangsta
That's the kind of niggas, that I like
Talking bout a hustla, that keep his mind on thangs
He don't care what them hatas say, keeping it gangsta everyday

Come get a ski-taste, we on a paper chase
For a Jada Pinkett face, with a J-Lo shape
Trying to bought a FED case, so I'm shaking and moving
Got partnas that don't rap, what you think that they doing
Now money we pursuing, SES be shining
Slim go ahead, and I done swallowed a dime

Come ride with a thug now, you could let your guards down
Be yourself, you ain't gotta act when I'm around
See I ain't the jealous type, that like to bust and fight
Live your life, sweetheart you not my wife
I'm far from a gentleman, you feel what I'm saying
I'm a hard working hard man, nigga with plans
Understand I get around, and can't be held down
Fuck what I did last night, let's have fun now
I want a brown dime piece, that can roll a sweet
That's a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Who say hood rats ain't fine, they done lost they mind
On a scale of one to ten, I done seen plenty nines

I like em high class with ass, Gucci down to the ground
When she pass, she make the whole crowd turn around

Real deal Cedric Hill, trying to make a mill
Give a woman ecstasy, without taking a pill

I want a gal caramel, that smell like Shanel
The kind of female, you put in your V-12

Yellow bones race up, but I reverse on dark
They like Free from BET's, 106 & Park

White, light skinned or dark, don't hate on the race

The double G for ghetto gold, getting green and go-getter

Some hard hitters bout our figgas, out that Texas nigga
We pull triggas on fake niggas, bullshittas and quittas
We shut em down, top bound, turning smiles to frowns
Going round for round, from each town to town
The new pitcher on the mound, is the Mr. Slim Thug
The young boss out the North, that sell like drugs

Ha ha, it's long overdue baby
Huh, been waiting for the Southside
That swanging and banging to put it down, what?

Mr. Slim Thug, huh
Northside, Southside let's do this homie
Ha ha, C.M.G. Boss Hogg Outlaws
We platinum in the ghetto, tell 'em Ke

H-Town superstars gotta walk that walk
Popped up on twenty twos, will make you squash that talk
In Texas a living legend, it just ain't my fault
If I see it and I want it, I just go to the vault

We some city slickers
But these niggaz out of state think we some shit kickers
You bring your nuts up on your guns and just try to get us
But I ain't gon' lie you fucking with some real mob figgas
I'm talking hard hitters

We out here stunting, while most of you niggaz faking and fronting
Slim Thug and E.S.G. and Lil' Ke, we pay for hunting
It's a hell of a ride, hell of a role, hell of a stroll
We ship it gold so the paper can fold

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip
Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip
And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do
Northside, Southside, we got love for you

Now hol' up hol' up, E.S.G. hit the do'
Say, ""Ke, we ain't cooking thirty six no mo'""
I whipped eighty baby, I'm in the game forever
Represent it sold a million independent together

I'm with the Young Don, Boss Hoggs in the do'
Working with a quarter mill, smelling like hydro
Look at the grill hoe, I spent sixty on ice
I'm at the Source Awards looking like a disco light

Purple Sprite push white, FED's starting to get curious
Act a fool like Ja Rule, move fast and furious
What you get when you mix two of the Screwed Up Click
With the Boss of the north standing 'bout six six

Now this is it, watch me spit sixteen from the heart
R.I.P. to DJ Screw, you was there from the start
Now on your mark get ready, playa roll up a ounce
'Cause when the hook come in, drop your top gon bounce, huh

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip
Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip
And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do
Northside, Southside, we got love for you

It's H-Town dream team, ball more than a king
I guess it's in my bloodstream to be about my green
A new face on the scene, I'm the rap game rookie
Trying to do some new, I'm tired of cooking up cookies

We getting paid down here, living laid down here
Hit the club with bald fades and braids down here
Slim E and Ke, we Texas best
We three hard young G's, that don't settle for less

You can't mess with the Tex, Boss Hogg on top
When I park at the club, my rims don't stop
They keep cutting, ten G's for these with the buttons
In the DTS strutting, I ain't want for nothing

From the bottom to the top and I can't fail
I'm in a click about they mail, I know you can tell
We living swell 'cause we got a lot of thangs to sell
I know the FED's on my trail but I'm giving 'em hell

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners, burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip
Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip
And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do

I'm riding one deep with my gun, naw I ain't having fun
Wondering how to break the news, to my partna lil' son
His daddy probably the saw the angels, death he couldn't stop it
But God, why'd you have to take my dog Todd Prophet
Already lost Mello, now who gon be next
Think I'm feeling safe fake ass rappers, having plex
Who you playing with, don't take your life for granted
So many good people, seem to be the victims on the planet
Can't understand it, now which religion talking noise
Them Catholic priests, be touching on lil' boys
Can't trust your homeboys, you drop em off at home
He call his partna on the phone, they done broke in your home
Now what's wrong, said the Lord people dying too often
With no health or no insurance, can't afford no coffin
So today no flossing, another wake at eight o'clock

Now lil' Tamika up the street, wanted a baller real bad
Only 16, but already giving up the ass
You got cash you could smash, you don't have to ask
She needed money for clothes, so she stayed skipping class
Catch her flipping in a Jag, or flipping in the Lex
Laughing at the nerdy chicks, who believed in safe sex
She had one baby, had twins then another
Now didn't slow at 18, all living with her mother
Steady bouncing out of town, rent-a-cars with crack
Missing her kids birthday, what kind of mother is that
The ass started getting flat, without using Metabolife
Whole neighborhood wondering, if Tamika on the pipe
Strip clubs late at night, with bags under her eyes
Had the flu for three months, feeling like she bout to die
Boyfriends disappeared, and so did the queen
HIV in her bloodstream, girl died ay 19 damn

Now Lord I know, I'm in the valley of death
And can't no man predict, how many days he got left
Use to run the street, with some devilish ass demons
High on dust not giving a fuck, smoking wet steady scheming
Had to change my ways, and go another route
Now I use the studio, to let my pain out
No more chasing dreams, gotta make it on my own
Can't be waiting on the next man, gotta get my hustle on
Now in case you ain't know this, playboy I'm focused
Only got one chance, no way in hell I can blow this
Turn my last five dollas, into a quarter million
But money can't change, the fucking pain that I'm feeling
From Chris, Paul to Tremain, who else gon go
They even killed Romeo, from the Steve Harvey show
Said I'd be dead in a year, that was two years ago
Thank the Lord I'm still here, hope I live to see mo' let's roll

Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply
Cause any DJ that deny is a mother fu errrwwwee lie
So give the ladies what that want
Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
to feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up (Turn it Up)
Yeaah Sound of Revenge saying Universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigggga (He's Baaack)

When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang
5 karot diamond chain vvs is in it mayne
You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint
We got that oomp spray, but it still stank
You a lame so yo dame playin mind games
Ima pimp so I stay in that mindframe
Niggaz talk shit untill I let that nine bang
Me and Duke in that maybach switchin lanes

E.S.G.,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2007

E.S.G.,"[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

E.S.L.,"In the morning 
On the beach there 
People gather 
To meet the sunshine 

With open arms 
Reaching for heaven 
With open hearts 
and open minds 

I found a lover 
By the seaside 
With sexy brown skin 
And haunting eyes 

Time keeps passing 
But no one cares 
Life for living 
Is the thing there 
Be yourself, be free

Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe, and the happiness that died
I let it get away
(Been payin' ev'ry day)

When you were so in love with me, I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too, but how I cried over losin' you
See me down and out, but I ain't about to go living my life without you
For every day I made you cry
I'll pay and girl, till the day that I die

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe, with a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe, and the happiness that died

(Been payin' ev'ry day)

Oh, I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
If I'd been a man in reality, you'd be here, babe, lovin' me
Now my nights are long and lonely, and I ain't too strong, babe
I just miss you so
Girl, but you're too proud, and you won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe, with a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe, and the happiness that died
I let it get away
(Been payin' ev'ry day)

My road is kind alone
I just gotta get back home
I'm really sorry for acting that way
I'm really sorry
Oh little girl I'm really sorry
For telling you lies for so long
Oh please forgive girl
Come on (give me a chance)
Won't you forgive me, girl
Hey (let's have romance)
Ooh, forgive me, girl (let's try again)
Come on, forgive me, girl
I want you over and over
And over and over again

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe

"E.Y. ""Yip"" Harburg","Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

I'm on the grind... (can't wait to shine)
Fuck that, I pull your blinds, catch you f'ing with mines, no go 'head
I got no time (hate to be wastin' time), muthafucka know the name
And know that I ain't feelin' ya'll lames, like novacaine
Ain't no way you can (stop the train) or the conductor
Of the track, muthafucka, that's E3, my love for the game
(it's just not the same)
Unless it's Gilla House, and Wu-Tang Clan, in the house, cop them thangs
Live together and (pop the chain), know your lane
Fuck cocaine, stick up, bout to blow your brains off the map
The (Flame is back), it's the amazing
J. Blazin' grapes of wrath turn to raisin
What part of the (game is that), we not playin'
Ya'll try'nna raise the price at the door, we not payin'

And son got knuckles in his Air Force One's, come on

Niggaz never seen it this raw (but nothing's gonna hold me back)
Keep the heat up by the big dog (but I don't wanna hold you back)

Nigga gotta get this dough (Live your life)

Yo, yo, on the air (thought you dead?) But I returned
To give you what you waited four years, now to burn
Hold your head (and know your ledge) your life flash by

Method Man (Method Man, Man) Whoa, like Black Rob, go
Catch me in the West Wing, I might ""Rob Lowe""
Yes, I can (yes, I can can) tap your jaw
And tell whatever chick that I'm with, slap your broad
This is it, (I'm stuck with ya'll) and ya'll stuck with me
In the lap of luxury, where the hell's cut for free
And the kid (can't fuck with ya'll) Til I got a tree
On some new property, at my new pot to pee, have mercy
(Mercy me) Things ain't what they used to
Soon as you get your shot on the top, somebody shoot ya
These rhymes (ain't nursery) Life's a bitch
Then you go to court, and she take half your shit, come on!
