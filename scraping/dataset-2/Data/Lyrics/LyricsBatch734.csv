I done taught and talked
Walked away and fought
Went from cussin and bustin
Hustle from day to dark
Turned nothin to somethin
Introduced to stunnin
In my life In my life
I done caused some hurt
And I done did some good
Said I can't even when I could
I was stopped and tested fingerprinted and arrested
In my life In my life
Just say no when I really meant yes
I'm gon smoke all night til it hurt my chest
Slim told me over the years that shit gon tear up careers 
In yo life In yo life
What'chu gon do when snakes come to yo crew
I'm a get on my knees and ask the Lord please
Separate good from fake and the love and the hate
In my life In my life
[B.G.]
I mean fuck I done had a rough life you know what I'm sayin
B.G. lived that thug life
I done done it all in my life
I done done time
I done lived in group homes
I been on the third floor of hospitals
I mean it's just been a stuggle for me
But now I'm on top you know what I'm sayin
And it ain't to turnin back
And I take chances in whatever I do
'cause if I don't take chances I don't see the life after all
[Mannie]
The night in the Rover
When the niggas came over
You went out like a soldier
And I still can't get over
What fake bitches done done
Got me clutchin my gun
In this life In this life
I used to wonder why 
All the good niggas die
Why some soldier gotta suffer
And mothers gotta cry
Why my daddie gotta lie
'cause he don't even try to be 
In my life In my life
Take care of your crib 
Where you lay down and live
Forget and forgive 'cause you done put it through some shit
Had yo daughter and yo son 
Been down since day one
In yo life In yo life
What the fuck is wrong you don't understand this song
Tell yo momma you love her before she dead and gone
Nigga that don't quit that's some real ass shit 
In this life In this life
[Juvenile]
Man I mean me Juvenile drugs tore my family up
I'm from the projects so you know I just realized
What it means to be successful
'cause I been through all kinds of shit man bullshit
And I live through Baby, Slim and the Lord to help me
And I came to them as a real nigga 
And I said look dog I'm tired of livin like this man
[Baby]
I had pounds of coke
I had money to blow

Shot up cars before 
In my life My life
I got kids to feed
I got niggas to watch

I need to get off the block
Wear soldier Rees
In the gamblin spot 
In my life My life

Got money to prove it 
I done flood the public
Hope Beatrice'll do it
In my life My life
Now my name is Baby
But the call me Bubba
Ain't a bitch that I know that can say that I love her
Gettin pussy from a boss bitch wearin a rubber 
In my life My life

Let me bling and floss
Let me ride without the law always searchin my car
I just want to chill fuck bitches and play

Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

Uh, Point Blank Charlie, I'm that nigga
Been killing them Kanye tracks before Jigga
Hooked with no ID when Kanye moved to NY
I was in the hundreds running around totaled semis

Left Cash Money and started my own empire
And we don't do no bird call, bitch, we been fly
And we won't kiss another man in the mouth, we gangsta
But we will run up in your house and stain ya

Close range murder remain ya
Empty the whole clip plus what's in the chamber
And if this won't help you, Joe, you know what we aim for
Lower that ice, boy, you know what we came for, nigga

Act like it we gon' put you to sleep
We'll own everything worth something, even your teeth
And beef, you don't want it, I promise that
This is south homicide of Chicago, honor that

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

You could never hold this block like I do
You grew up with a house full of women
And let your momma pussify you
Started gang banging in high school
Got your ass whipped and you stopped gangbanging in high school

This is something to ride to, bitch, ho wonderful
Twista, Common and Kanye look real comfortable
Bump, Fest and Mikkey finta snatch it from under you
I'll help a nigga bag depending on how my numbers do

Huh, and this ain't talking greasy, greasy
This is Jeffrey mannerisms and they need me, need me
I'm a gremlin after 12 ho feed me, feed me
Girls, we got, it's too hot for TV, TV

That's right, naw, it ain't Jeezy, Jeezy
Them Chicago-Rillas gon' snatch ya freebie
Wear it around the hood, believe me
And when you want it back the price moved up

Like George and Weezie, I will never sit
I will never tell when the heat is on, I will never bail
I will, never, let a stud extort me
I'll run up in your house with Malik

And we ain't finna spit poetry
I'll put a punk head with a floor beat
I'm like bullets flying through the hood
You can't ignore me, bitch

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

My crew is thorough, I see life through a barrel
I'm clean 'cause I make green like blue and yellow
I got a deal, I ain't flash, you'll ball out
I went in cops with crates of guns and passed 'em all out

I'm that hood, make rappers call it quits
I've been good, Atlantic just made it all legit
It's all real, y'all rappers just act hard
And we spend money like it grows in our backyard

The MAC-11 is with me, I'm going well over 80
In that navy blue 760
And I'm headed towards the hundreds, the king of the city
Going to get this money
(With Rhymefest and Mikkey, nigga)

Crossing them, you're dead wrong, I will grab that chrome
Put it on your head like some headphones
You don't want Bump to squeeze till the legs gone
Block bloody murder, redrum

Fuck the law, man - I`m known for cooking it row

My whole crew can sit to at x-cons and killas

Rockin props, the fades - the letto pump boochie
First statis, rock rolo - when I came to the door?

and now it`s Bentleys, Mansions and meats to the floor
Kickin gears on Parley`s, while the straight pipe screen

Mack Sapranos - the most of unforgiven
and fuck a job, cause dope money is how I`m living

Mikki Bleu,"I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love  you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

"Mikko ""Linde"" Lindstr","You had demons to kill within you screaming
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes
Love preys the living and praises the dead
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed

Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged
Kiss and tell, baby, we're bleeding well
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane
Kill and tell, baby, we're bleeding well in hell

?No love lost under her will?, I heard you weeping
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in
If death is the answer to love's mysteries
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream

Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged
Kiss and tell, baby, we're bleeding well

Mikko Alatalo,"Silmissäni orpo katse lapsen eksyneen
Rakkautesi jäljet vihloo rintaa
Käy pimeys päälle lailla pommikonelaivueen
Ja minä kun en koskaan kysy hintaa.

Viidestoista yö taas saapuu painajaisineen
Ja kaikki, paitsi elämä, on turhaa
Aina oikein uskoa ei jaksa ihmiseen
Kun ihmiskunta tekee itsemurhaa.

Sun kanssas katson maailmaa
Ja samaa unta nään
Kuin hullu huudan rakkauteni perään!
Sun kainaloosi käperryn
Ja jos sallit yöksi jään
Ja kun aamu on, en tiedä missä herään.

Käy tuuli läpi pääni, etelästä pohjoiseen
Oon yksin ajatusten raunioilla
Ikuisesti kolisevat sanat tyhjyyteen
On jälleen tuskan viitta hartioilla.

Viidestoista yö, se saapuu aina uudelleen
Taas huomaan kahden viikon unohtuneen
Jäi iholleni hiekkaa rannan autioituneen
Voi olla että vihdoin pääsen uneen.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin ya
Spank ya shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'ma slam you ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than a block I run on you
And I'll smoke ya junior mafia in front of you
With the ready power tuckin my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Ya clout, pretty sour I get packages every hour
And hit em up

Chorus
Grab ya Glocks, when you see 2Pac
Call the cops, when you see 2Pac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Busta, we hit em' up...

Verse Three: 2Pac
Peep how we do it, keep it real, it's penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you suckers gettin
Killed with ya mouths open
Tryin to come up offa me, you in the clouds hoping
Smokin dope it's like a sherm high
Brothers think they learned to fly
But they burn little suckers, you deserve to die
Talkin bout you gettin money, but its funny to me
All you suckers living bummy, why you're messin' with me
I'm a self made milionare
Thug Livin out a prison, pistols in the air, hahaha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on tha couch
And beg the trick to let you sleep in the house, ahh
Now its all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it, and smiled
Now I'm bout to set the record straight, with my AK
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Little busta, I hit em up

Verse Four: Kadafi
I'm from N-E-W Jerz, where plenty murders occur
No point to comment , we bringin drama to all you herbs
Knuckle check the scenario, Little Cease
I bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin pleas in de janeiro
Big Momma, is you coked up, or doped up?
Get ya lil Junior whopper clique smoked up, Please tell me
Is you STUPID?!?! I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my clique lootin, shootin and pollutin ya block
With 15 shots cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw mafia clique movin up another notch
And you bast stops squaws get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass east coast props brainstormed and locked

Verse Five: Idi Amin
You is a, b writer, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to ya face you ain't nothin' but a faker
Softer than Alizee with a chaser
Bout to get murdered for the paper
Idi Amin approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Prodigy in a choke hold
Totin smoke, Outlawz we ain't no joke
Thug Life, cowards betta be known, we approachin
In the wide open, guns smokin
No need for hopin its a battle lost, I got em crossed
Soon as the funk is poppin off
HAHA I hit em up

I play and sing - pack my things and move along

A pretty face, another place I never get to know
A one night stand, another show

My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know

I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein' on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then I'd never be alone

In this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand

Is something worth this kind of fight

Until you came into my life

To a place
Closer to heaven

Baby when I see you smile
I forget the tears I've cried
Everything I've ever lost
I've found in your eyes
You give your heart
With no conditions
And you take love to another dimension

To play your favorite song,
And when it freaked me out to hear it on,

Stir my searching roots

That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",Thanks for the Memory,1996

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

That never did come true?

There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's one more circle I'm dying to try
There's a piece of my head that's asking why
There's a piece of my heart that's dying to fly
There's a baby in the woman that's waiting to cry
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's got to be a way for a lazy face and
Get up and start loving the human race
There's just got to be a way for a crazy face
Get out from under this paper chase
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home

I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Miles Davis,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1984
Miles Davis,"Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch
I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a gate, I would swing
Have a fling almost any old thing
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong",If I Were a Bell,1984
Miles Davis,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Miles Davis,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

Miles Davis,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
for your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.

Miles Davis,"I took a backseat a backhander I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you
You gotta conscience compassion you got away with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too
I don't have a purpose omission I'm empty by definition
I got a lack girl that you'd love to be
You want to diva a deduction you want to do what they do
want to do damage that you can undo
Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

[Chorus]
I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You want to message a confession you want to martyr me too
You want to margin of error for two
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer an exception I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew
In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do
Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
want to forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you

haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Now's the Time,1988
Miles Davis,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Miles Davis,"My old flame, I can't even think of his name but it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Miles Davis,"His liver damaged in the wreck
The windshield shattered
All for an instant fleeting like cars from the street
Cat tops spin across the highway and horses die in backseats

Don't blink now
I know I can't talk man, but I understand
Any way I look at him my love, you've got to come back soon it's not fair
They choke your neck with a seatbelt that meant to help

Break it apart
Misunderstand me
Flash this evening on the sky screen
Drive to Vegas and get yourself hitched

If I live through my imperfections - two glass decades and you're still angry - I don't want to be your friend anymore
We turned a wheel that raised a wall and made this living world turn red
But I'm not scared
I pulled my arms from the fence where I leapt

Violet...
Like rain returning (...Violet...) back to the earth from a cloud
Falling down makes you squint as it hits your glasses lens
I set a trap, caught myself

So I surrender
That's what I did
It wasn't there
No, no, n-n-no, it wasn't there

I looked, I looked
I looked everywhere
The girl I lived for Saturdays she watched this brilliant star grow faint
But it's not there - It's not there

I made this light to give to you
No matter what you do
I've been storing up these words to pour like rain like peace upon your perfect head
Illuminate you, stardrenched lover

I surrender
She wore a charm (She wore a charm)
A necklace that you had tied (She tied it)
Before that night I drowned you in a reservoir

And all the world a twirling top - it will be yours to stop",Violet,1989
Miles Davis,"The night is getting on
The band is getting slow
The crowd is almost gone
But here we are still dancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

Our feet can barely move
My legs are yelling ""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove
And love is still advancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

You can't suggest that we could go on jitterbugging
No bugging

We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than hugging
Just hugging

But we don't need much room to gently cut-a-rug in, we two

We're dead on our feet
And the sauce is repeatin'
But what can you do?

I tried another juice
And get from head to toe
My body's feeling loose
And warm and kind of supple

Nothing to do, but waltz

My man would slip away
My arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay,
Till we're the only couple

Nothing to do, but waltz

You never know how far this sort of thing can get you
One never knows, one never, never knows

We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You stay up half the night with me, if I would let you
Yes

So come, let the waltz play again",The Jitterbug Waltz,1989

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1989
Miles Davis,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

I hope you have a white one, but for me, it's blue

Blue Christmas, that's the way you see it when you're feeling blue
Blue Xmas, when you're blue at Christmastime you see right through
All the waste, all the sham, all the haste
And plain old bad taste

Sidewalk Santy Clauses are much, much, much too thin
They're wearing fancy rented costumes, false beards and big fat phony grins
And nearly everybody's standing round holding out their empty hand or tin cup
Gimme gimme gimme gimme, gimme gimme gimme
Fill my stocking up
All the way up
It's a time when the greedy give a dime to the needy
Blue Christmas, all the paper, tinsel and the fal-de-ral
Blue Xmas, people trading gifts that matter not at all
What I call
Fal-de-ral
Bitter gall, Fal-de-ral

Lots of hungry, homeless children in your own backyards
While you're very, very busy addressing twenty zillion Christmas cards
Now, Yuletide is the season to receive and oh, to give and ahh, to share
But all you December do-gooders rush around and rant and rave and loudly blare
Merry Christmas
I hope yours is a bright one, but for me, it's blue",Blue Xmas (To Whom It May Concern),1990

Next thing, door burts open 
And there I am caught in the raw

Spongeing all my money

Pulls out his chequebook and starts to endorse
Two Benjamin Franklins

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

Of paradise, where roses grew

Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,1993

What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning

Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two

And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,1988

Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,2003

Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo

Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart

Miles Davis Quintet,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2005

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

wroight a book and feel much brigter,
share my thoughts with the world.
Or maybe I could be a film maker,
celluloid, more fun than paper,
you never see the scren's corners curl.
Aah maybe then I could be a lover,
find a girl and win her over,
and tell her that she's the only one.
But maybe then a philanderer,
I'd sneak around and lie to her,
and kid myself that I'm the happy one.
I'm not looking over four leaf clover,
I'm just waiting for hell to freeze over.
Maybe I should take the mike, (mic')
stand up tall like Michael Stipe,
and try to solve all the problems of the earth.
Or maybe then I should sit back down,
scratch my chin and use my frown,
and try to figure out exactly what I'm worth.
We'r estill building churches, burning books, 
killing the babies to feed the cooks.
Who said the world would turn out fair?
So I guess I'll dig myself a hole,
ask the devil if he wants my soul,
And do soemthing real like cut my hair.
Ooh, ""maybe this"" and ""maybe that"",
it may be satin and it may be sack.
won't really matter much in the end.
May be my enemy, may be my friend?

And asking the wrong questions.

Just as the evening, threatens to set.

Consider this now it's not too late,
I have watched you change
The colour of the trap before girl
I have learned to wait.

Most of the things that you say
I don't understand but I will sit and listen.
I nod along attentively,
But the truth is I can't concentrate.

Miles Schon,"You were not born broken but the damage you carried
Was like a broken doll being sold at a fireworks display 
You were my sweet poison, made me drunk with desire
While you set the walls of our little house on fire
Leaving me behind to pick up the shards 

Of your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart

I held you for years, wiped away all your tears
But when your mascara ran I knew you’d light the fuse
To blow the two of us completely apart

With your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart

Sometimes I think we could have been the best one-night stand any two people could have
Instead I wanted you to fit with me like a lost puzzle piece
Now sleepless I walk through the ashes of my memories 
Where the worst words you said were that “You’d always have a place for me”
In your shattered glass heart

When I finally said ""no"" to your anger and your pain
I walked on broken glass through the winds of your hurricane
Now I’m out here making a fresh new start

With my shattered glass heart
My shattered glass heart
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart
Your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart",Shattered Glass Heart,2013

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be part of that world?

Don't know why I get so down

I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me

It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you it's alright

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself and I

Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got
It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
'cause it all falls into place

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

Face to face, eye to eye
You're standing there
Feels good on the inside

I don't mind, I don't care
You're standing there

Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different

As I am is how you want me and

It was me who was being the fake

Why did I smile when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you

You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free

[Chorus]

They can't
We can
Parents might not understand
Having fun without a plan
But that's what we do
We're all here (Let's go!)
Gotta make this party grow
Together we can make it blow
Right through the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe

[Chorus]

We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise
Feel the thunder
It's time to lose control

Party now, party now

Miley Cyrus,"Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Just to impress you

Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star

Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you
Saying let's hang out
Then you confess
That there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

But you don't know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a

Rock star
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star

Not so typical

Another chance to get burned

Miley Cyrus,"Let it begin!

Nobody listens to me
Don't hear a single thing I've said
Say anything to soothe me
Anything to get you from my head

Don't know how really it feels
To fake the days to make like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts
To turn around like you were never there

Like somehow you could be the break
And I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break!

I thought I'd lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
But I kept the moment that we were in

And I knew in my heart you'd come back to me my friend
And now I got you! I thought I lost you!

I told myself I wouldn't sleep
'Til I searched the world from sea to sea
I made a wish upon a star
I turned around and there you were
Now here we are, are!
Here we are

I thought I lost you!
I thought I lost you!
You!

I thought I lost you
I thought I lost you too","I Thought I Lost You [From ""Bolt""]",2008
Miley Cyrus,"Sha, sha, sha

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

Compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy
Still miss you baby
It was real
It was right

But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left
Is all these ashes
Where does the love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done

How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll
Never find again

At the bottom of the ocean

In a dream you appear
For awhile you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing
I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever

After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll never find again

This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to
Love me for me too
Baby ever understand
Just know I love the time we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad

Be happy
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me
You love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for the both of us

Nothing hurts like losing
When ya know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin'
To hold too long

But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same

So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road

A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked

Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell
What's round this bend?
No disgrace, about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

A lot to say
But not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your tail lights fading
I try but it still won't fall
I remember what it feels like to know love
And have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

Don't know how really it feels
To fake the days to make like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts
To turn around like you were never there

Like somehow you could be the break
And I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break!

I thought I'd lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
But I kept the moment that we were in

And I knew in my heart you'd come back to me my friend
And now I got you! I thought I lost you!

I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change

Don't wanna let her go

Knowing I'll never hold her

Yeah, before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standin' out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone

I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

Trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds are ripping out my broken heart
They always say that a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standin' out in the rain
Knowing now it's really over
Please don't leave you alone

Miley Cyrus,"We both lie silent, still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could let you know somehow

Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Yeah it does

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar will remain

Every rose, every rose
Every rose, has its thorn

I know I could saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

Searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love

With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away
I can't tell you what the future holds
Or how to live
All I know is
What feels right lights up my life again and again

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love

Miley Cyrus,"I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow.
Been shooting in the dark too long
When somethin's not right it's wrong
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love,
It's always hit me from below.
This time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,
I could stay with you forever
And never realize the time.

Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doin',
Stayin' far behind without you.
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin',
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.

I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
San Francisco, Ashtabula,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.",You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go [#],2012

But I've been left with the live bait
I done messed with the fire, I met a girl on the side
I done leave it all on the line

Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib
Money ain't nothing, what about the real and the way you build
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry

Love, money, party
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn to love, ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party

Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party

Okay, I walk in, sorta late
My girl and watch both coordinate
They both got that gorgeous face
They both shine, they both mine
Getting green 'cause it's go time
God damn, I'm so fine
All the guys oh super model type girls
Yeah, I'm chilling with those kind
B.I.G. Sean don, whine Perion
Detroit, player boy, get my berry on
On an all night flight to an island
I'll be gone in the morning
I don't even need a carry on
What, this that all night, get dressed up shit
Red cup, get messed up shit
Me and Miley, it's just us bitch

Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn to love, ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party

Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party",Love Money Party,2013
Miley Cyrus,"Chapter one we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us, are we really in love
Trying to figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on
You think this is everything
But this is no book of us

You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish
Leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You told me it's as good as it gets
Yeah I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

You might think I'm crazy (crazy)
That I'm lost and foolish
Leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Felt the pages now, this chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day
Then I'll be on your mind

You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish
Leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right",Maybe You're Right,2013
Miley Cyrus,"I walked through a pool of water and I seen the shadow of a broken hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar, for better or for worse

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me, stand by me

I ain't pop no Molly but you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop

We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together

They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D

Stand by me, yeah, my darling, stand by me, yeah
Yeah, three D, yeah, movie, we gon' make a three D, three D

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, three D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me",My Darlin',2013
