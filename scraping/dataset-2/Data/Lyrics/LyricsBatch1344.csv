Party girl, party girl
Out in LA with a party girl
I was all good with Bacardi, girl
Now she tryin' to up the ante
I was kinda drunk and handsy
Johnson looking long like Randy
Hoping that my pitch is strong
Now she's like ""let's do some bumps""
Ew, chill I don't do that (Ew!)
Poured a rail and she blew that
Now I'm scared, I look pussy
Spark the blunt 'cause I do that
She was sniffing that Tom Hanks
I was just sipping Chris Brown
She keep on sniffing that Zeus (Coke)
I keep my eyes on the ground
She like ""don't knock it 'till you try it""
That's some bullshit (yeah, I know)
Just do a line of this Betsy Ross
I started thinking, can't deny I'm a pussy
Like as a child I was so dissmissive of the baked potato 'till I tried that shit
Now the baked potato is my favorite kind potato
Now she got me wondering what else I left on the table
Twenty-eight, I still ain't done no anal (true)
And I'm unusually skeptical
But man oh man this bitch was raw
So I asked her for some Molly
She like ""start with Miley""
I'm like ""give me Molly""
Crazy 'cause I

I never even tried it, never even tried it

I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Now I'm doing Molly, I hope I survive it

Brain
Flippin' a bitch and I'm poppin' this shit and I don't really feel it yet
He never done it before and I'm worried I'll feel neglect
But I ain't trippin'
Balmain, Brain 'bout to get to kissing
I'm sauced up, fucking with this breezy boo
Haven't eaten since four, man I need some food
Why these broke people looking at me? (you broke)
I'm feeling good and happy
Hold up the Molly kicking in now
I think I should sit down
Brain for the win now
I think we should dip now, girl let me know (we should dip)
Brain overwhelmed losing control of this front lobe (hello)
I was G'd up, now I'm T'd up
Like a ball playing motherfucker in Atlanta
Shout to Dwight Howard
In case she didn't let him (ew!)
And now I'm puking
Girl I blew it, but I was just doing my j-o-b

Brain, what the fuck is going on?
The molly got me shakin' and clenchin' on the jaw
It got me going crazy (It got me going crazy)
How the fuck you blame me?
You the one that popped MDMA
When you never ever even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine
Never even tried

You gotta talk to them bro
Ok

Chill, girl
We should chill, girl
You been humpin' on me too fast, keep it real girl
The brain on the same page
Fucking another one, ""Damn, LD how do you slow a hoe down?""
I'm 'bout to show a hoe how
Baby girl, let's slow it down (yeah)
Drill her when I'm in it, I admit it
But I hate it when these bitches ridin' dick super quick
Aggressive ass movements hurt my dick (ow)
I don't know why, just the way my dick was built (oh)
Getting the impression when they get up on erection that they think it'd be impressive just to go full tilt (fast)
0 to 100 bitches going full Wilt
Seriously afraid that my dick might wilt (hurts)

Out and 'bout with my baddest bitch
Throw that hoe a middle management at the Radisson
While she hoppin' on the brain like a savage bitch
She fuck me ravenous
I'm assessing damages, shit
Coronating all the money bags
Coronating on her fucking ass
Orating, I don't like it fast
Pores chafing when she fuck me fast
(And the Brain don't even got no dick)
(Woah) But I got a dick, and I'm tryin'a do it like this

Let me fuck slow on you girl
Let me fuck slow on you girl
Where them hoes lookin' bomber than a landmine?
Will my bros that be fuckin' on 'em stay alive?
Let me fuck slow on you girl (chill, girl)
Let me fuck slow on you girl (said chill, girl)
And the Brain got them bitches on stand-by
And the Brain getting hungry Raisin Bran time

Chill girl, we should chill, girl (we should chill, girl)
I've been looking at them ol' breasts since they real, girl
Thinking through the words like I read it
(?) Brain, if you see a tight end then he toss like Bennett
1 in 7 down, going down like credit
Don't get shook like lettuce (lettuce)
Brain tryin'a get fucked
Brain tryin'a get sucked
Brain been in for a month
Fucked a bitch on that kiss cam
Yeah I been doing my thing
LD not even checking for Brain
Hey, we should go flirt with this dame, kay?
She should come flirt with the Brain

But this bitch has it all like a Genuardi's
Now my mouth is watering just like my spot for Hardee's
I'ma go chill with the girl be back (?) all day
Young L, I got a knack for hauling that
I might even get up in the bathroom stall with that
Please, you ain't been fucking like Brain
I got this shit like a car alarm when that car is parked around thieves (ooh)
Got this shit like gardener that's in charge of all of your trees (ooh)
Young LD got a poppin ass shirt check
Backstory, kinda poppin, where's my work check?
I might even go up to the bar and cover her check
And then you'll say what?

Let me fuck slow on you girl

Where them hoes lookin' bomber than a landmine?
Will my bros that be fuckin' on 'em stay alive?

AKA homicide
Yes, homicide

OG's knew I had it poppin'
IG lookin' Photoshopish (it's lit, it's real)
They just can't take charge so they floppin'
New shit looking like it's knocking
Rap game, not a game, well I ain't broke so it's cast off
Really I been keepin' shit a hunnid like the Cubbie tryin' to close it with a fast ball
I don't even do this shit for money but they buying it in droves like it's half-off
If Dicky gotta show out there
You know he 'bout to show out there
Rol' on my arm
Russ on a farm
Piston, new guard
They put the boy on the Jumbotron
Just to pump up the crowd
At my ten year reunion, like look at me now
Having good sex on the reg
New Tempur-Pedic, my bed
All of my lawyers are black
Shit is ironic as hell
But I guess that what happens when Jews started rappin'
Used to have turtles, no wonder I'm snappin'
Used to commercial, right, used to play Madden
No wonder they let me do both for a bag
I was not in a frat, I had never conformed
In a 2000 cab I had never performed
I ain't takin' no L's
Fuck what you sell
I barely pay for my drinks, doin' well
I tell 'em there is no need for the glitz
I don't need sparklers, they know that I'm lit
I'm on top of the world, fuck all these girls
I prefer momma to play with my curls
I can tell all of you rappers ain't thorough
Head hit the pillow and boom it's tomorrow
But how can you sleep? (ew, ew)

How can you sleep? (ew)
How can you sleep? (gross, how?)
How can you sleep? (how? Ew)
How can you sleep? (how? gross)
How can you sleep? (how? Ew)
How can you sleep?
You still asleep

How many bitch ass rappers I gotta slap today?
Put it on Worldstar even though Q passed away
Pull a .38 out of my pocket and then cock it
Leave a nigga on an island like he in cast away
Cock strong since them old Doc songs
Like an old Pac song, outta my mind
The lights on, but I'm not home
Something is wrong with me
I done brought six strippers from Vegas home with me
Trees By Game they getting blown with me
FaceTime with Karrueche, they on the phone with me
Tell K good night, I'm hype, I might ignite
Plastic cups, Promethazine and Sprite
Man I don't really know who's song is this
Who's weed I'm stealing and who's bong is this
And I don't really give a fuck 'cause I keep the ammo tucked and you can keep on swinging from my nuts
But don't say I can't rap like I'm not a Rap God
Like I won't break your fucking favorite rapper's rap jaw
I don't give a shit
Big or tall, short or small
I'll cut your dick off and sit it on Trump's wall
Then spray paint ""Fuck the President"" it's evident
Hip Hop dead, them new niggas irrelevant
Different color braids, you niggas stuck in the maze
Ain't grew up by a beach, so you rot in the wave
Man, I'm so glad that Guwop out
And rap fans still give a fuck what 2Pac 'bout
I'm right here, I don't give a fuck who hop out
Don't let Mark Zuckerberg get you knocked out
And don't try me over IG
Don't try to be subliminal and get it by me
I'm a criminal, I'll leave you hooked to a IV
Next to Jimmy Iovine over hood shit, but

You can start a rap shit
I ain't never lost at that shit
Let me clear it up, Proactive
I could walk up in this motherfucker looking everybody dead up in the eye, like we can rap for that shit
You'll get embarrased
I'll be in Paris, don't compare us
Flow the rarest
Got bitches in the bedroom, over sharing
Got an Aussie and a Brit like I’m going with Sharon
So apparent, heir apparent
But I don't want it next
Someone tell Complex it ain't complex
And what you lookin' at is now like a Timex
I am checked the on now off the clock like compound
I'm really adamant, you're really adequate
I'm really passionate, I'm Billy Madison
I'm the motherfucking graduate
Twenty ten with a pen, I didn't plan this shit
My plan legit, I manuscript it
It was living by the candle stick
But for the plaques I had to mantle it
All my friends thought Dicky was a joke
Now they tryin' to see a show
Now they out of breath, try to speak good
I remember everyone that didn't think I could
Every publicist who thought that I was mocking hood
Look who tryna to stop him jerk
Look who tryna to rap now
I don't even fuck with you
If what's done is done, how come I ain't done with you?
And if it's fucking done, come on how dumb is you?
Let me get another tissue
I'll be crying 'til the fucking bank pull that card again
From Charlamagne to Busta, Game, to Puff, to Sway plus love the pain
From Snoop to Chainz, it's all the same
Ain't no debate, they know who fake, they know who great
You don't know your place
Cameras around me, they don't know your place
Shooters around me 'cause I entertain
I got 'em shooting they movie
I could meet a bitch on a Tuesday
Girls come to me
Don't got jewelry
Don't feel bad when I bust in my Jacuzzi
Don't eat ass but it still be lookin' juicy
Front page, coming at you like a newsie
Hoes didn't choose me, now I'm choosing
Now I got a Jap on knees like sushi
Lil' Dick got vert, no Uzi
I might just pop that coochie, bruh

No, I I hadn't thought that far ahead
But of course, can I get you a T-Shirt?

It's just a personal thing, it's not you
Okay sorry for doing it
No, no, it’s just a personal thing, it’s not you
Okay cool. Yeah
Uhhh, so you're from Minnesota?
Only thing I know is that it's cold
Break it down, how's it compare to living in LA?
Well, I can't compare them they're so different
Y'know what I'm sayin?
Yeah, for sure
She like apples to oranges
Yeah, well you can still compare them but I hear ya
What's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?

Uhh, do you fuck with the war?
She like huh, what did you just say?
Huh, like just now?
Yeah
Do you fuck to the war?
No, I don't fuck with the war
I'm like no, I don't fuck with the war
Just don't know how to react to the forces
I should have just thanked you of course -
Uh, why would you thank me?
Uh, I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay
While we on the topic
I been actually thinking about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation?
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?
Like do we have the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?
So not at all, like would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation?
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?
Granted I don't know the alien heart, but
You get what the fuck I'm sayin?
Like what the fuck would it be like?
Would they be like Earth go hard?
Or is it just another conquest?
Or would they be like damn earth go hard
They was harder than Simian
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff?
Then she like no
I'm like well what you think?
She like I don't concern myself with hypotheticals that couldn't be
I'm like girl what you mean?
She like I don't believe
In the war?
In aliens
Oh hold up
Hold up, wait
Girl what you sayin?
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?
I guess
What an enormous coincidence that shit would be
Do you see what I'm sayin'?
I can't hear what you're sayin'
Well the universe always expanding
There are infinite galaxies
Why would we be the anomaly?
She like that's no coincidence
I call that shit God

I been killin' shit don't mind me
I'm just top flight
I could sure use a Sprite
I'm thirsty as fuck
Who gettin money?
That's brain
Who make decisions?
That's brain
Who make the hits?
That's been brain
Who run the whole operation?
That be brain
(Brain, can you just get back to the issue here)
Uh, can you just remind the brain?
(You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if he exists)
Don't call brain names
The brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a god
(I believe in a god, yes)
So god never wrong
God never wrong, right?
Yeah, that's like the whole point
(Brain just get there, please)
Hold up
So god made the earth
And god was like hold up, this shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like Imma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit?
What is your brain even saying?
Can he get to the point?

Hold up brain you just did it
God ain't wrong what the fuck was he thinking
About what?
Bitch, the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then he like nah?
Dinosaurs are just blah?
What's your point?
I'mma cook up some blondes?
Like he was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Ho them things 35 feet
I'm like 5 foot 11
But on Tinder I'm 6 foot
Seen that Brachiosaurus
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
And that's just an expression bitch
There ain't no heaven
Ha, funny
I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception
Can I talk now?
Go ahead
Look
Everything in life has purpose
You, chickens, a midget at a circus
What?
I don't interpret
She like that's not for me to determine
So dinosaurs purpose was to just die?
That's not for me to determine
But ok
I'm just a person
Okay, but think of the root of the argument girl
View how we started this girl, like you don't believe in the aliens
You confine God to earth girl, I find that shit silly salient
I just don't presume to know the plan
Bitch me neither but that's not what I've been sayin
But what are you sayin?
Why can't God fuck with aliens?
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy?
Ok, look we just don't see eye to eye
Yeah but logically like you don't believe in your side
Yeah but you're like bringing up fucking dinosaurs
Like we could have shared the earth with them nobody knows
Yeah, there is hard soil evidence girl
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea?
She like lets change the subject
Ok
(This bitch don't know about Pangaea, uhm)
Brain leave it alone
I'm starving, are you hungry by chance?
Oh my god I'm so hungry
Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?
Fuck yeah. fuck yeah, I'm on it
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing
Come on dude I'm a grown up
I'm capable of having intelligent conversations
Okay, I just fuck it
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni
Ugh
Sausage?
How can you eat that shit?
No, no, no, this not Dominoes
This legit, is high quality meat and shit
No, no, I'm vegetarian
Oh right, well we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like
Uh, ew, I can't have that shit
In the same box
Seriously? You're that against meat?
No, I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten
Okay, is it how we treat them?
Uh, that sure doesn't help
Ok
She like I'm not opposed to us hunting
But now we not trackin' them down
We just breed them to eat
That's disgusting
You should honestly read on the subject
Alright hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just decided the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want
That's my point we just incubate animals
Instead of just letting them live how they come
But, that's just your God at work bitch
Why we go hard on earth
What you think would happen right now
If you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you
Wolves?
Bitch, they would tear your ass up
Viciously
Like they would eat your titties
And your pussy
That's what they do
And your face and shit
Humans are smarter bitch
That's what we do
She like apples to oranges
Bitch that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared?
She like I'm gonna leave
There's just all of these conflicting principles
Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza
I will, that's my god given right
She like where is my bag?
Oh that leather one next to the trash?
That's the one right? Made out of cow, I think?
Uhh why are there no Ubers in this area?
So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit
I'm not listening dude
That's barbaric as shit
Do you come from the vikings?
Why are you even still talking?
Do you take peoples land?
Do you fuck with the war?
How are there no Ubers anywhere?
Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here
I don't wanna add shit to my phone
Okay the choices are clear, ho
Ubers are not around here at all
Taxis will come but they real slow

And the brain gotta poop
T minus 5 till the brain gotta shit

I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitchy
Uhh, look do you just want to sleep here?
Uhh no thanks
It's past 2 am
I'm not sharing a bed with you
You can sleep in my bed, I'll just sleep on the floor
Fine, you're sure?
Yeah, it's cool
I won't throw you out to the wolves
Oh my god, you are so annoying
I couldn't help myself
But can you at least throw me a pillow?

I'm just pillow talking with a bitch

Why should I call you my lover

You look so disappointed tonight
Do we have any reason not to
Go out and make it all right,
Before the time has come to leave you

Your phone is always busy when I'm calling
Your neighbors say that you are not at home
Why should I feel like a jerk
Especially if I'm not the one who
Made you a victim of love
Why should I, why should I..

One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme

That is always haunting me
Funny little strain 
Running thru my brain
It's as sweet as can be
It has such a pleading way
Tho' it's with me night and day
When I hear someone playing
I walk right up and say
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing
Just doodle doo-doo it
I love it so  
Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
 
I've heard all the melodies
From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest 
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo

I say it's waste not, want not
I think I'll take another
I'm holding all this pain that I'm trying to smoother w
With the neon glows that keep me thinkin 
About my brother and my mother in the city upon the BV sound

With thoughts of cognac kisses for the men in black

For real, north to the south, to the east, to the west
Come and bless, Buddha zest got me true to confess
Saying yes yes yes yes
To the top is where I'm reaching 
The chronic got me tweaking
And I'll be reaching for the peaking
More than you ever fuckin' seen, when I soar 
Take flight to the skies on demise

And other men said we weren't worth the fuss
You could catch 'em all bitching by the bar
Above the fine line between the rich and the poor

I'm living life in this forest,
The shadows and stains;
And the government,
They take the gains,
But we're left with the reigns.
In the name of our God and our dead generations,
The poets have been called for creation.
We were born free to the world,
As we were born we will depart;
I refuse upon the mic to be refused my spark.
See the fire seventh sign is near,
So hear this calling,
Once the man, come twice the child.
'Cause the fear of the man turned us all fucking wild,
I'm born again to see the end.
'Cause all I really truly got is this block and my friends,
But where am I gonna be when there's nothing left to spend?
And I remember what the dread said;
And I remember what the dread said:

It's not my fault that you lost your way;
Your insanity will prevail.

With a BV3 g riff to a drunk drum,
C'mon man, spill some outcome.

When I was lost, I saw the forest was dark;
You lose the fire and the flame with the loss of the spark.
I let my body house demons,
That fed on my mind.
I was looking for myself,
To myself I was blind.
Because my senses confused, with what was once so real;
I could not hear taste touch or fear.
But slowly I try at each and every cost to rebuild these strengths that i've lost.

It's not my fault that you lost your way;
Your insanity will prevail.

To the place outside yourself.

The mammals, lions, fishes, and the camels.
And you know what they're gonna do:
They'll set you up,
They'll knock you down,
They'll kick your ass all over your hometown.
And they're gonna ask you something that you've got to learn to do,

Even Catherine O'Hara's come by to say hello. 
You really want to know? 
Well, I'll tell you, I might have to pour myself 
Another little moonshine... 
Here we go: 

It was a sweet and frosty May, 
In the town of Thunder Bay, 
When Dale and Wendy Day went out 
To Sweetbrush Lake. 
Found a weeping willow to sit down 
And do the Thunder Bay a go-go, 
While the wind was real soft. 
Poor little Wendy just had to break. 

Later on that month, 
Dale went for Pepper lunch at 
The ""we're-all-in-this-together diner"". 
Yeah, the pea soup was fine, 
The corn cob on time, 
The chili dogs even finer. 
The real reason was that Wendy 
Was working counter. 
Those two little kids just couldn't 
Get enough of each other. 
Dale broke out like a man and said: 
""Wendy I think I want to take your hand 
And make little children, live beyond the sand. 
In respect to the clouds 
And the colony of your eyes, 
That day we made love, 
I'm going to call my little child Amber Jones"" 

Hey supermodel, set the rest of us free. 

Which is exactly what happened. 

There ain't no genie in the bottle, 
Or in that magazine. 

Let me ask you one question, and it goes: 
Hey supermodel, 
What's it like being pretty? 

Now everyone knows that if you're going 
To run a successful café, 
You have to hire the prettiest waitress. 
Amber it turns out had been working 
At the Pepperlunch café 
Just like her mother did 20 years earlier, 
And it boils down to this very simple doctrine, 
Given by Ralph Habbasham the owner: 
Ralph says the customer is always right, 
And the customers here are mostly men, 
And though it don't seem, 
>From table 2 to 16, 
All men do is dream: 
Of falling in love, just like women. 
Now sitting at table 20 was a man 
From New York city who was most impressed 
With Amber's poses. 
He said, ""Come over here missy, 
I gots a kind of proposition, that is,
Iif you're willing to listen."" 

Hey supermodel, set the rest of us free. 
There ain't no genie in the bottle, 
Or in that magazine. 

Come with me. 

Hey supermodel. 

Where will I stay? 
My place, where do you think? 
Is it big enough? 
It's got a double bed! 

And she was just everywhere! 
I mean little girls wanted to be like her, 
Little boys wanted to be with her, 
And even mothers somehow altered their physique 
Just to be a little close to what Amber represented. 

One day Amber, who likes the Sweetbrush diner 
Where she used to work, really missed 
Those coconut cake cucumbers, 
And made out with one giant flesh missile 
On the top of her forehead. 
Poor little Amber couldn't do a thing about it. 
And her poor career went kinda downhill 
As the people outside her hotel room penthouse 
Cried out... 
Well, you know what they cried out: 

Hey supermodel, set the rest of us free. 

Sing along with me gals. 

There ain't no genie in the bottle, 
Or in that magazine. 

Hey supermodel, 
What's it like being a teen dream? 

Shackles, shackles, shackles on my heart, 
I loved you from the very first day, from the start, 
But you left, call it theft of the heart, 
Bring me back the spark, 
Pretty girl, pretty princess, that is left. 
Bright lights in the glitter, 
The shine of the night, right, 
You dreamed of the city 'cause you dreamed of flight, 
But it's timber, watch these trees that are falling, 
Pretty little princess with no one to call, 
It's a small town now girl, it doesn't seem so small, 
First love, fifth grade, first kiss at the mall, with me.

Bring it back on the m-i-see,

To race the clock.

And every time I leave you go and lock the door.

So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder, I'm another day late and

Four months at sea 4 months of calm seas to be pounded
In the shallows off the tip of montauk point
They call them rogues they travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk

Cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow
Your tongue is a rudder

It steers the whole ships sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep

Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reefs
The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame
Off the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and the rain
And I wished for one more day to give my love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm

But this ain't the Dakota and the water is cold
We won't have to fight for long this is the end
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear

Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea

I will float on and on
I have burned the bush that covered my light
And now I'm scared I won't burn that bright

You heart attack
But you're the apple of my eye anyway

My smiling face, it's on your plate, it's on a silver plate

They say in heaven
There's no husbands and wives
On the day that I show up
They'll be completely out
Of their forgiveness supplies

Burning out my center till there's nothing but dust
Rolling me with care into your cigarette

I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon every time I can hold a song
A tycoon, I just went and brought another home
Who you stunting on? I'm never off

By weaker Cypher men 'cause what came from my pen
Made 'em lust, now I must
Rush out the back door, in-to the alley
Girls in pursuit, enough to form a rally
I didn't want to scuff up my brand new Bally's
So I made a quick dip, like I was goin' back to Cali
Took the Lear jet, don't fear yet
Comin' on your earset

'Cause I'm out here tryin' to do my thing
And get these papes in today's society, 
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tryin' to make things a little better
But if you want to make matters worse
Let me say this first
There's no need for you to try to do me

You tried to do me
You tried to do me
You tried to do me (But see baby)
I am not the one (I am not the one)

You tried to do me 
You tried to do me
You tried to do me 
But I am not the one 

And now check it, I'mma end it like this
Now good times come, honey good times go
I think this is somethin' that you really oughta know
The name of the game is to maintain
'Cause when you lose someone you love, then you feel pain
It's up to you to decide if the love was worth losin'
To me you're not the everyday, Tina, Tammy, Susan
Why can't you, understand?
Instead of tryin' to run the flim-flam on the grand
Baby, do whatever is clever
'Cause we can make this last, forever and ever
With joy there's pain
But don't you worry about the Puba Maxwell, 'cause I can stand the rain
Shoo-be-doo, this is what you oughta do
Think of all the things that I just told you
Remember all the times when I used to hold you and say
We can last through eternity
But don't ever try to do me",Try to Do Me,1990
Brand Nubian,"I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is, not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Englebert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on 'She's Gotta Have It'
I think with the brain and I whip behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm ""saying bye bye dumb bitch""
Stick out your thumb and hitch
'Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
'Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jump on the phone and dial the Now Rule Mob
Now come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
Now wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
'Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me take me home and try me and do me well

Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
'Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob 'cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
'Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good 'cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper",All for One,1990
Brand Nubian,"Brand Nubian function
A junction of three
Collaborating in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms
Tap a soul
'Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo Black it's kinda ill
We don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is ""Brand Nu""
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
400 years and we're made to feel cursed
But now it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

You have to stand as a black man
Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of my force
See me riding on a jet black horse at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel
Brand Nubian function in conjunction with the three

Brand Nubian
Not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind deaf dumb and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold
(The black, the beautiful, the bold)
Now if this falls short I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasa Kuma, Ahmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To put it exact dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel
Brand Nubian

Nubian
A native or inhabitant of Nubia
Nubian
A member of one of a group of African tribes that formed a poweful
Empire between Egypt and Ethiopia
From the 6th to 14th century
Nubian
Any of several languages spoken in the central and northern Sudan
And that's why we call ourselves Brand Nubian

As the midnight oil burns, our minds turn
Make a mistake and be fake and you'll burn

That the tree has the knowledge for what you yearn

Tonight we got a really big show ah really big show ah

We have, the brother, Derek X
Ahh, his theme tonight, will be on

Brother Derek X

Ah yes yes yes thank you thank you thank you
And all of that, yo
Before I get this wreck I want to give a strong shout
To all the positive brothers and sisters that's out there
And I just want to let y'all know
Who I came down here with
I slid in here with Lord J
And Alamo with the A
And I came to get wreck, like this

I'm kinda blessed so I wrote this manifesto for life
Co-signed by the others with a knife
On the real tip let's take a field trip from the ghetto
You pick the time and we'll meet in the meadow
To discuss racial issues and tension
New York's a powder keg did I forget to mention?
Now case in point y'all remember that Brooklyn Bridge joint
When things got wild and willy?
Yeah that day the Feds played the role of the bully

""Up against the car""
""Yo I ain't even do nuttin' man""
""Ayo shut up or eat this night stick""
""Yo why you pushin' me, why you hittin' me man?""

Now Huey Newton was slain and we all felt the pain
Of Yusef Hawkins, and they was mad but we was squakin'
They tried to show a false compassion, yet at the rally
They tried to bash in our brains
Further adding to the bloodstains
I was mad at this news and so was my brothers
And I wanted to get violent but I'm a lover of black mothers
And black mothers need sons
Not children that's been killed by guns
It's, just another form of slavery, a modern day lynchin'
The others get reward, the black man feels the tension
Inside, not out to hide, just provides us all the answer
I will stop racial injustice if I get the chance to

Civilized man's main goal is to teach
And I try to achieve this with verbal outreach
In my community, and all outlaying counties

Remember what I said is to teach your own
At home first, and as we disperse
I sparks your head like a cloudburst

Derek X I'm guaranteed to be the ultimate
(Brother Derek X) I kicks the flavor

So bust that I drop the stack from an almanac
It's all truth so it's got to be a shown fact
So keep on this is the dawn of the Capricorn Turtle
A rhyme that I kick is stored daily in my journal
Or my diary when speakin' on the black man I gets fiery

The record's in the record store, category's black war
Best you ever saw and it comes in a three or a four pack
In a month or two I'll be back
To confer with you on both of my works
In my contract, I get crazy perks from Elektra
See me kick this rhyme and I covered the whole spectrum
This is the final verse, grand finale in Crescendo
Message substance of the X cannot be thrown out the window
Unseen, lean two years past the teen
Never use makeup got a natural sheen
It's like that y'all let's have a ball
I'm Derek X about six feet tall

Yeah and as I stop this wreck for one sec

Also to club kid Marley Marl 
Pete Rock from the Vernon
I want to give a shout to Mike P and Cherokee also in Tucson

MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Monie Love, and Linque
What more could I say, I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Hats off and I'll never forget
'Cause if it wasn't for them, there wouldn't be no rap shit
Back to the track of the new
For short you can call me MC Grand Pu

Puba rubs off on ya just like lotion
I'm not conceited, girls say that I'm attractive
They describe my love and that's being hyperactive
I'm just a brother who likes to romance alot
Look at me as the black Sir Lancelot
That's right, your knight in shining armor
If I went to college, then my major would be drama
Or theatrics is more like my tactics
If you want the proof then lay down on the mattress
Swing wit the swinger, I can be a singer
Alamo controls the beat wit just one finger
If you wanna swing to this, you better take precaution

Feels so good
Feels so good

Yes yes yes
It's a test test test
Now Rule is the town
Where we rest rest rest
If you were wondering
Were the ballistics finally in
Once again,
Brand Nubian
You and your girl came to see the three rock
Now she stays
Kick the funky lyrics, throw her down
To her PJ's
Lay her on the floor and do work
In three ways
After the party
Guess what?
Ayyo she's still payin'

Feels so good

I got this girl a mink sable, in return I got a cable
Her name was Fat Mabel and she broke my kitchen to table
Ate pasta with this Rasta, went out with her sister
Her hands on her chin, thought she was a mister
Went out disco dancing, gave my feet a big blister
Smacked in the face until I finally I dissed her

Encounter with a stunt, and I'm out for spot fronts
Extensions on her wiggy, I thought her name was Ziggy
But her name was Lucy and I met her on the deucey
Put me on hold to go in a store to get loosey
(Come on)

Ayyo mack she need to stop it
Now let me kick some flavor since we're building on the topic
'Cause yo, I knew this girl and her name was Tina
She rested in Medina, never saw eyes greener than hers
But yo there was just one little flaw, the green eyes 
I had to penalize, 'cause they was bought in a store
A synthetic cosmetic, it was pathetic
If they was real, then yo she got the credit
But they wasn't so she doesn't
I like the natural look, so I kicked it to her cousin

Feels so good
Feels, feels so good 

Come here let me put it to you like this sugar
Don't go changing, to try to please me
Don't change the color of your hair
Your hair, your hair, your hair
I said no no no I just want someone
That I can talk to
I'll take you just the way you are
Word is bond
Yeah right

Too hot to handle when I was young I used to vandal
Giving girls the comfort like a foot and a sandle
Always help another brother, never running scandals
And if I hit the skids, well I'll just panhandle
Now I'm gettin' papes, but stunts gets the vapes
I see it as a joke cause they break when you're broke
I can give a roar like an ancient dinosaur (Roar)
Swing a microphone like the great mighty Thor
Puba Maxwell is the mack that's hyphenated
Girls seem to love the way my things are situated
Hump on a bump 'til them bumps is feelin' sore
Take a quick breather then I'm goin' back for more!

Feels so good
Feels, feels so good 

Brother, Derek X, kick flavor

I do my thing like B.B. King my microphone is named Lucille
Throw a dip in my hip so they call me extra ill
Making big hits from tidbits, how I make my bread
Do some situps, and squat thrusts, to keep a level head
'Cause I'm well bred, and mannered, I create in my workshop
Stay up late at night until my brain says to stop
Then I quit, wake up in the morning and continue it
I find the same line, and add some more ish that's hype
But my stripes, marks me by champ
Check out the bass coming from the power amp
I'm the controller and like the Ayatollah
I used to live in Saudi Arabia
I never come out straight out with an answer
Just a yes, or a no, or a maybe I do
But with my crew sometimes I get blazed
Jump on the floor and kick a new dance craze
I can read and I've red since the days of rhythm
If rhymin' is fundamental, then light up a spliff
And grab, and not an ounce of flab, is on my body
My mother's part Spanish, my father's part yardie
I'm not a junior, try to see me catch a wool
I got yeast to rise straight through the moon

Feels, feels, feels, feels, feels so good
Feels, feels, feels, feels, feels so good

Lord Jamar, God Allah step to it!

Girls scope this, like in astrology they aknowledge me
That's 'cause I'm God, but don't look too hard in the sun
'Cause you might get done
My number's seven, that's six plus one
Now any way you count Lord Jamar will amount to be
A tower, so yo, knowledge my power
As I conclude, to girls I won't be rude
Just verbally feedin' 'em my mental food
I embellish with lyrics, that can't be contested
Serve 'em straight from my mouth and in your ears they're digested
The rhyme I say, is out of the ordinary
Some say unique I prefer the term extraordinary
MC's rhymes are ancient like a dinosaur fossil
They're weak and outdated while my rhymes are colossal
Like a Lamborghini, I look good, and I'm expensive
Plus the power I'm unleashing is just, too intensive
Discombublatin' MC's with thin mind percentage
Guys like my rhymes, girls like my masculinity 
When I'm on the mic I say what I feel
I'll never perpetrate 'cause the God's for real
It's like that (That) and at my jams you know you'll never be bored
So just dance and scream, praise the Lord

Alright now this is how we gonna do it
Before we get out like Shout

We used to be some soloists but now we form tri-pack
And if you try to step to this, you just might catch an eye jack
And if you were intelligent, you really wouldn't try that

Puba's kickin' flavor, and I brought somebody with me 

Positive, the gentlemen, the rapper 
Suave, blase, you know dapper 

See this is not a song about friends 
Because we make the ends, and then we spread the skins 

This song becomes a well known tune 
And my mic's gonna bloom like a flower in June 

We kick much flavor, and you know that 
As smooth as the head on a Fed named Kojak 

Grip the mic till my hand get calloused 
And I'll tell you like Ralph Kramden told Alice

Go Puba, go Positive
Go Puba, go Positive

To my adversaries, I'm not ordinary 
Not the Godfather, or the Tooth Fairy 
Not Jack Spade or Engelbert Humperdink 
Listen to this rhyme, and tell us what you think 

One, two, three, Grand Puba's on the count 
Rhyming gets me papes in very large amount 
Brother, you're wrong if you think crime pays 
Don't like gays, and take vacations overs holidays 

Practice safe sex to prevent strange diseases 
Wear my hat, on one night skeezers 
I roll dice, but don't bet on the horses 
Punks take losses, and I don't reveal my sources 

So, um, take the fifth if you're planning to riff 
The rhymes spread like Jiff to make your loose knot stiff 
Kick up your feet if you're feeling kinda queasy
Relax, (ha ha) take it easy! 

You're in good hands, Positive is a survivor 
I make rhymes of anything; I'm like McGuyver 
If I were a computer, rap would be my program 
Since I'm a righteous man, I don't eat ham 
I wish more people was alive like me 

But Positive

What up, Max? 

See, the vocab is lovely, girls be thinkin' of me 
Other rappers try to be me, competition can't see me 
So, hey, whaddaya say? I got the flow, y'all 
If you don't know the time, then you better check the Seiko 
Or Timex, I suplex, get biz on the cossacks 
Put 'em in a line then I ask, ""Who's next?"" 
Grand Puba, guaranteed to make a big hit 
Doin' much damage on this two-man skit 
Trying to hold me back won't harm me 
And when the gear gets too small, it's for the Salvation Army 
So mommy, or mida, away I say, ""No one's sweeter!"" 
(Now, that's funky!) 
You see, the style I kick is rugged, I shine like a nugget 
Present tense mean you dig it, past tense mean you dug it!
So dance to a light tune, my little doll 
Da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, dah 
Rock me wit' vibration 
Give me a deep meditation 
There is none betta than Grand Puba 
Baby be get it all togetha
You see the second time around 
I hope the label don't flake 
And if they do, I go to Drake and say, ""Give me a break."" 
Like Toyota say, I say (Oh, what a feeling) 
I bust the foots of Lionel Richie 
I caught him dancing on my ceiling

Pass me the mic 'cause I wants to blitz 
I'm the best thing that came since grits 
The Prince of Rap, lookin' for Cinderella 
If you see her, why don't you tell her
I got the shoe in the car out back?
And if she makes the fit, she's in like that 
And as a matter of fact 
I'm not an actor, but the main factor 
Pinpoint and his rhymes is like a protractor 
I'm intricated, complicated
Definitely musically related 
Rhymes so fly, never been outdated 
Gots to be fly by the way I state it 
Now, of myself, I say I'm a big fan 
Got more rhymes than words by the Letterman 
Positive K, you can say he's low key 
You might know my name, but, now, look you don't know me 
I can be nice and flip like the Son of Sam 
Nobody knows exactly how I am 
I'm the next, and everybody knows it 
Open tours this year, next year I'm a close it 
I've got the skills that pays the bills, now 
Here's a quote from Stephanie Mills 
Don't put a rush on me 'cause my tempo's slow 
And if I don't tell you, then how would you know?","Grand Puba, Positive and L.G.",1990
Brand Nubian,"Ayyo, check this out
Brand Nubian gettin' ready to swing this ep'
We got the Grand Puba, we got Derek X on the flex
We got, Lord Jamar, we got Alamo with the A, Ron Stud!
And my man Ep Rock
X, kick the flavor for me on this one
'Cause we gettin' ready to be out of here in a, sec

Wild, New York raw as my voice box soars I'll
Open your pores 'cause it's one of my chores
Kickin' beats to boggle rhythms, cuttin' rhymes to a schism
People often wonder and ask
Is I'm the best?  Surely you jest, I'm not down with the rest
In fact they failed the test
It's my vernacular that's simply spectacular
My bite is in your neck it's the effect, of Dracula
Man on a mission, go to school with low tuition
Can't even keep account, of the G's I be kissin'
But oh I beg your pardon, the race, is startin'
The criminals is there and I'm the hardest of the hard
And it's a feet for you to meet me on any given day
The adjective amazing, spelled with an 'A'
And a 'G' on the end, by usin, my pen
Set forth on a journey for the, perfect blend
Rhymin was a fad in the days of my dad
Now MC's is makin' G's and goin' for bad
The X in my name makes it, all official
Am I the king? Well that's the so-called issue
Rollin off the tongue was the fresh one-liner
And CB talker was the zero one-niner
Took a slight drop from the tip of the top
Now I'm out for mines and I'm goin to clock
What's mine on the line on a rhyme I will dine
Never ate the pig can't deal with the swine
Keep on, yes my word is bond
Speakin' that knowledge like Farrakhan
'Cause it's ragtime!

Ah yeah it's ragged, let's do it!
Aight now we got Lord J
Lord J, yo c'mon now
Kick, the flavor, to this
Drop it like this (I'mma swing it like this)

I like to drop bass, 'cause when it hits, I bounce 'em
I do this with my seven and my one half ounces of brain
Which I contain, to manifest thought
The record is bought so I figure I ought to elaborate
(Might as well) As minds in turn collaborate
I speak the facts black, I don't exaggerate
I just get to the bare essential
Demandin' that I talk, of my credentials, 'cause yo
I never slept, my mind was in the right place
Now let's take our steps and retrace
Back to a time, when black was defined
As original, God-like, Supreme Divine
Refined is my mind that's why I'm buildin'
There was a void in New York but now it's filled in
By the Lord J, don't forget the A-M-A
To the R, now say I'm a star (You a star, J)
Well you can be one too
Now here's all you got to do (Whatcha gotta do?)
You got to know knowledge of self's the foundation
Know wisdom's the way to let it outcome
Understanding is the manifestation
And cultural freedom, the final turnout, 'cause it's ragtime

That's definitely ragtime
Now let me rag mine, let me rag mine at this time
Ayyo, bust it (Here I go here I go here I go)

As I, stand as a Pharaoh and read up on Eliza
Trick ends on my friends, 'cause Puba's not a miser
Last longer than a Duracell, or a Energizer
I got a little older but a whole lot wiser
When it comes to shootin' shots I'm a damn good shooter
MC Grand Puba should be worshiped like a Buddha
I boogies to the rhythm, kicks all the flavortism
Damn I gets busy, though makin' rhyme I gets bizm
Always help another meaning sister or a brother
Just a little tip I picked up, from my mother
Smooth as Ali Baba once I week I see the barber
So honey pucker up 'cause I'm a damn good slobber
Mr. Exquisite, dressed in silk, Bally's made of lizard
So honey, what is it? (What is it?)
I rock a rhyme at a wedding, next tour I'm probably heading
You want to beat like this? Check the stack of Otis Redding
I'm hurtin' like a blister, confusin' like Twister
Not a only child, four brothers and one sister
Not a rinky-dinky never snackin' on a Twinkie
When it comes to flexin' I can bend like a Slinkie
So here comes the champ, to civilize a tramp
When brothers try to play me, that's when the Pub' gets amped
So smile here comes the picture, click!
A humble type brother so don't play me as a vic'
I can relate to the Good Times, the Cosby's on the sometimes
Granoble's on a Sunday then it's back at work on Monday
Take my gear to the cleaners, buy pants or a Beamer
Then I'm out, bangin' crackheads, I can do without

Tryin' to do me but see they're no competition
Grand Puba's the type, to get hype, to any funky sound
Never the type, to give a damn about a hand-me-down
Papers of rhymes of mine are stacked high like lumber
If hun wants to swing ep', she takes my beeper number
The skills go back to the days of flippin' coins
Pasttime readin' books by my man Donald Goines
But I'm not a pimp, and I don't walk with a limp
You can say I know the game, 'cause I know how to treat a dame
So knock three times on my ceiling if you got the feeling
Grand Puba's good for sexual healing
Lord have mercy this is lovely, I'll say splendid
Puba's on the stage, and I'm glad you all attended
Rhymin to the beat, is the way I make my money
I'll buy, sweets for my sweets and, no sugar for my honey
Brothers get, played for their papes
And if a stunts tried to play me, I'll hang her like some drapes
Puba's the man, and you can't run the flam
So take it elsewhere, my dear
See others try so hard to be this
Competition tries so hard to see this
But I let 'em know, I'm not the one
So see the next one, wha-oh-eee whoa!
I'll slap five to a brother who ain't about no jive
I'll smack ten to a friend who hooked me off with skins
See I'm the type of brother and I like to have fun
She said, ""69,"" I said, ""68, and I owe you 1""

And when I step to other rappers, you better yell timber

'Cause MC Grand Puba come fi rhyme dancehall!
I'm flippin' the wigs of those who gig
I never renege on girls who dig
The super supreme, one of the team of three
See I'm one of the best with most finesse
I really suggest you do not mess
Or try to test the very best at this
Do you really wanna know what's next? I gotcha gotcha gotcha
Grand Puba is one of the best I rocked ya rocked ya rocked ya
Here I step, with the rep that's kept
In a orderly fashion, sucker MC's I'm mashin'

It's that I'm bad, bad inna wicked in bed

You like to taste the lead, well get your face fed
After I'm done, you rather suck on pencils
Here comes the coroner with chalk for the stencils of your body
As I walk over the shit and spit outta heart
Now brothers talk shit and can't back it
That's why I had to fit em with a full metal jacket
Peel his cap once cause I know it's all it takes
Watch the muthaphucka bawling, his body catch the shakes (BLAST)
Just before he die, I'ma look him in his eye
Ask the nigga how he figure he was big enough to try
The muthaphuckin G-to the O-to the D
I told ya couple times that the Gods must be crazy
But ya didn't listen, so now ya on a mission
To get an autopsy, a raw see-O, ya can't stops me
Now tell me is there anybody else
Before I put my AK back on the shelf
Cause I put in work like Job Corps

Their life by a knife or a gun

A good dick, couldn't even stand the .44 lick
Dead quick, the funeral is strictly closed-casket
And ol' Aunt Faith, her baby fingerpaints
My Moms know the time so she want to send me down to Alabama
I gotta cousin, says she's got some friends
She says they strictly fucking, I could get away from bucking
She tried to gas me up, I tell her sex is everywhere
And sex is but a word, it ain't shit I ain't heard
Tell my Moms I ain't leaving, my crew said to stay
My crew I'm believing so fuck it anyway
I got my mob from the Rule, that live by the cruel
And my crew from Courtland Ave. always say they'll set it off
And if I choose, who's somebody might die
And if they don't die, they won't be able to walk

Well hey muthaphuckaz, it's the dread with the 9
Lead to the head of you devils, now it's bedtime
I said I'm not the nigga to be playing out
I'll leave your body laying out the sid, talk shit and you'll get licked
Get hit by a dread who's fed with the nonsense
Leave you red, where my clip empty out his contents
Spill your guts when I fill ya up with the flame juice
Niggas' nuts, I had to fuck em up and use my name loose
Some silly goose, we be down on the subway
He gets no love 'cause he's rubbing me the wrong way
Disrespecting, infect the masses
So I elect to come direct and dissect some asses
My nigga passes the gat, rat-a-tat-tat
Now you shut your fucking trap 'cause you was who I's fucking at
I got you sucking at the chrome like a nipple
The only way your ass is going home is as a cripple

Lost compassion for humans, and then smack up they moms
Ran and got the arms, from under the mattress
My little man Satan got something in his jacket
Let me get to work and I'll release the swarm
My man mean a lot these days
I got the hash, cash plus my people raise me well
Bring it to em X, and we'll take the weight
Run and get the Mac from the Park Ave. location
Bronx location, wit a extra bag of clips
Plus I want it tight and I don't play that much
So I'll have all the reefer and set up all the stock
And everybody's fucking, yo Money, she wasn't great

Feels so good
Feels so good

Yes yes yes
It's a test test test
Now Rule is the town
Where we rest rest rest
If you were wondering
Were the ballistics finally in
Once again,
Brand Nubian
You and your girl came to see the three rock
Now she stays
Kick the funky lyrics, throw her down
To her PJ's
Lay her on the floor and do work
In three ways
After the party
Guess what?
Ayyo she's still payin'

Feels so good

I got this girl a mink sable, in return I got a cable
Her name was Fat Mabel and she broke my kitchen to table
Ate pasta with this Rasta, went out with her sister
Her hands on her chin, thought she was a mister
Went out disco dancing, gave my feet a big blister
Smacked in the face until I finally I dissed her

Encounter with a stunt, and I'm out for spot fronts
Extensions on her wiggy, I thought her name was Ziggy
But her name was Lucy and I met her on the deucey
Put me on hold to go in a store to get loosey
(Come on)

Ayyo mack she need to stop it
Now let me kick some flavor since we're building on the topic
'Cause yo, I knew this girl and her name was Tina
She rested in Medina, never saw eyes greener than hers
But yo there was just one little flaw, the green eyes 
I had to penalize, 'cause they was bought in a store
A synthetic cosmetic, it was pathetic
If they was real, then yo she got the credit
But they wasn't so she doesn't
I like the natural look, so I kicked it to her cousin

Feels so good
Feels, feels so good 

Come here let me put it to you like this sugar
Don't go changing, to try to please me
Don't change the color of your hair
Your hair, your hair, your hair
I said no no no I just want someone
That I can talk to
I'll take you just the way you are
Word is bond
Yeah right

Too hot to handle when I was young I used to vandal
Giving girls the comfort like a foot and a sandle
Always help another brother, never running scandals
And if I hit the skids, well I'll just panhandle
Now I'm gettin' papes, but stunts gets the vapes
I see it as a joke cause they break when you're broke
I can give a roar like an ancient dinosaur (Roar)
Swing a microphone like the great mighty Thor
Puba Maxwell is the mack that's hyphenated
Girls seem to love the way my things are situated
Hump on a bump 'til them bumps is feelin' sore
Take a quick breather then I'm goin' back for more!

Feels so good
Feels, feels so good 

Brother, Derek X, kick flavor

I do my thing like B.B. King my microphone is named Lucille
Throw a dip in my hip so they call me extra ill
Making big hits from tidbits, how I make my bread
Do some situps, and squat thrusts, to keep a level head
'Cause I'm well bred, and mannered, I create in my workshop
Stay up late at night until my brain says to stop
Then I quit, wake up in the morning and continue it
I find the same line, and add some more ish that's hype
But my stripes, marks me by champ
Check out the bass coming from the power amp
I'm the controller and like the Ayatollah
I used to live in Saudi Arabia
I never come out straight out with an answer
Just a yes, or a no, or a maybe I do
But with my crew sometimes I get blazed
Jump on the floor and kick a new dance craze
I can read and I've red since the days of rhythm
If rhymin' is fundamental, then light up a spliff
And grab, and not an ounce of flab, is on my body
My mother's part Spanish, my father's part yardie
I'm not a junior, try to see me catch a wool
I got yeast to rise straight through the moon

Feels, feels, feels, feels, feels so good
Feels, feels, feels, feels, feels so good

Lord Jamar, God Allah step to it!

Girls scope this, like in astrology they aknowledge me
That's 'cause I'm God, but don't look too hard in the sun
'Cause you might get done
My number's seven, that's six plus one
Now any way you count Lord Jamar will amount to be
A tower, so yo, knowledge my power
As I conclude, to girls I won't be rude
Just verbally feedin' 'em my mental food
I embellish with lyrics, that can't be contested
Serve 'em straight from my mouth and in your ears they're digested
The rhyme I say, is out of the ordinary
Some say unique I prefer the term extraordinary
MC's rhymes are ancient like a dinosaur fossil
They're weak and outdated while my rhymes are colossal
Like a Lamborghini, I look good, and I'm expensive
Plus the power I'm unleashing is just, too intensive
Discombublatin' MC's with thin mind percentage
Guys like my rhymes, girls like my masculinity 
When I'm on the mic I say what I feel
I'll never perpetrate 'cause the God's for real
It's like that (That) and at my jams you know you'll never be bored
So just dance and scream, praise the Lord

Alright now this is how we gonna do it
Before we get out like Shout

We used to be some soloists but now we form tri-pack
And if you try to step to this, you just might catch an eye jack
And if you were intelligent, you really wouldn't try that

I don't see him, so you know the shit is kinda hard 

I searched and searched, but still there's no sign 

It's gotta be a trick for the deaf dumb and blind 

Now would you set up home, and wait for a Mystery God

Emphatically no! 

Mathematically that just don't go 

See me and my people been lost for over 400 years

Verse One: Sadat X 

This is the stick up boom music for styles to flow free 
But y'all know it's me or could you tell by the spree 
The deuce crew of the new, yeah makes the whole shit clear yeah 
Give the question, I'm tired of brothers guessin 
The Nubian brought the X a lot of fame 
But wouldn't it be a shame if it all up and ended 
That ain't the plan I had and shit like that ain't intended 
For the slick headed wonder, wearer of saggy pants 
Old school kicker, reviver of the circumstance 
Got a backpack with a fat stack of fac 
I got a three-oh, so P.O. step back 
I'm with the uptown baldies, kids that were Lords 
Kick for kids that's paid, I kick for kids with no funds 
Whole blocks come for classes kids with contacts kids with glasses 
Hardrock punks crack heads and even trunks 
want to know the truth, so they flock to my roof 
New York I got the grip, I told ya I told ya 
This means war, as if by Sister Souljah 
To think that the X would ever take a fall 
After gettin all of this, man you're crazy 
The only way I'd fall is if I got fat and lazy 
And I won't cause I work real hard 
Wake up in the morning at the hour of God and make beats 
Later hit the streets for some forty-fifth sweets 
So all y'all been told, black youth essential 
From the hard urban blocks of Now Rule residential 
That the God, rocks real hard 

Verse Two: Lord Jamar 

God damn right, the L-O-are-D, J-A-M-A-are 
Says peace and Allah you Akbar 
Back like a motherfuckin head to crack 
Brand Nubian tracks are filled with black facts 
Now I ain't Humpty Dumpty chump, see 
I ain't fallin, you can go call in 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Try to knock me off you never see another day again 
My seven-twenty-one-fourteen's ready 
And my scope with the laser beam steady 
So if you're feeling lucky, then come and catch a buck 
How could I kill a man, well I just don't give a fuck, so 
Check out the dreadlock, make the dead rock 
With my baldhead, aiyyo like the top ten 
We're bound to win, cause God don't like ugly 
You get slugged rushed raped robbed and mugged G 
I don't want to be the man, I just want to make jams 
Cuttin sharp like Edward Scissorhands 
It's ninety-two and of course we grew seeds 
they're planted like a farmer, so let's reap what we sew 
And if you're thinking that we're a hoe in the game 
We gettin wreck to your brain 


",Allah U Akbar,1993
Brand Nubian,"Cool-ass Al, he got a badge from the neighborhood yo 
Fly police car, the ninety-two model, now check it out 
Now Al used to rob, used to smoke, used to steal 
And he rolled a mean game of dice 
A factor boostin' he was nice as he proved on the daily tip 
At Macy's, he and this kid up in Lacy's 
Throw his head to blow when he turned into a Fed 
I seen him, one day, I tried to get inside his head 
There's two fit ill, glock cops, with passion 
Black shoes fit, like they was made, from ashes 
Another brother, a sister or somebody's pops 
And when I see Al, he never stops 
Unless it's to make an arrest 
He can't kick it, unless he writes a ticket 
He got a nasty way, attitude everyday 
It makes me kinda mad cause I really can't hit him 
But brothers scheamin' to get him 

(Shoot 'I'm inna de busta bumba claat) 

At any level the worst devil is a black one 
And if you see one you gots to attack 'um 
One day, I had the cell lit, up on Lewis Park 
Cool Al appears, backs up, fresh Clarks 
It's a hot day black, and the sun's beamin' down 
But I gotta get on the ground? 
You're, sworn to whitey, do you think that you're mighty? 
You take the honor of bein' the black Bull Carter 
It's a shame cause use done out your righteous name 
For a little rank and more fame 
You're whole style is chump, you forgot to use the pump 
So instead of warnin' brothers, better hide and take the picture 
You know the brothers want to hit ya 

(""Gimme a gat I'm bout to smoke this motherfucker!"") 

So carry your gun, especially off duty 
Don't forget that there's a price on the booty 
Hidin' upstate won't make you safe 
By the way, are you of Christian faith? 
Then prepare to meet your Mystery, become a place in history 
Force come shot down with some brothers from Uptown 
And if we're not totally through 
Then you'll be left black and blue 
Man these black ones is just as bad as the motherfuckin' white ones 
They get a bullshit badge, and think that they God 
But yo I ain't havin' that shit, I put a hole in they fuckin' ass 
Then they see who's God 
Comin' in our midst causin' this motherfuckin' confusion? 
I send that ass back to the essence quick fast 

I knew a cop named Roy, a good nigga boy 
To pull the trigger on another brother was a joy boy 
Didn't give a fuck if your face was black 
He'll blow out your back, and say you sold crack 
He'll see you in your car and don't like your look 
He got beef with gold teeth so now you're a crook 
Flash the lights, pull to the right 
Put up a fight, well say night night, cause Roy boy might 
pull out the heater, for him there's nuttin' sweeter 
Eight to your head, from his nine millimeter 
Roy had a thing about young black males 
He want to see em dead or either locked in jail 
Down with every drug bust, for him it was a lust 
Kickin' down doors is like dickin' down whores 
I remember when he was a rookie, a tough cookie 
Beatin' down kids for playin' hookie 
You see Roy is the type of ne-gro 
With a alter-ego that's illegal 
He like shakin' down niggaz on the block 
Take you face down, let you hear the sound of the hammer cock! 
No need to fill out a report 
'Cause everybody know Roy doesn't get caught 
Now he's feeling like Superman 
To the trooper stand, with an Uzi in his hand 
Now Roy's gotta answer 
The pig's gonna get smoked like cancer, sticks 
For all the tricks that Roy's ever played 

Toy with the wrong nigga, boy you get, sprayed 
For all the fucked up shit, that you put a brother through 
Black man, learn to love you 
'Cause even if you're dead, me and my crew 
Will beat you in your head, and leave your ass full of lead

Now I'll, freak of the week, or ride the quest of a yard girl's hips

Always throwin' a fit, want to talk a lot of shit 
But love to get hit from behind 
Gettin' crazy joy from my Lazy-Boy that reclines 
Seems the only time we're not in a fight
Is when I'm layin' the pipe
You don't want me to bone another chick 
Quick to claim my name and my dick 
But when I tell you get off the swine and get refined 
You act like you're blind and you lost your damn mind 
See I'm not the kind to let a woman run it 
How my man Rick say it? 'I Shouldn't Have Done It'
Is what I'd be saying if you was runnin' the show 
No hoe, there's no gold, the G-O-D know 
The time on the Sun and the Moon and the Stars

And my, casual freedom, where's my crew when I need em? 
A visit ain't the same like being in the game

Brand Nubian,"Y'all niggas hurry up. Go in there, buck them niggas and get the fuck out, 
Don't be playin, dogg playin', yahearwhutI'msayin? Kill them niggas and get 
The fuck back so we can stay ballin, we'll be chillin' right here 
""Eh nigga, I want to know if you're ready to do this shit? You ready to do 
This shit or what, motherfucker? And don't be actin like no pussy when we 
Get the fuck out, man"" 
""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Well if you're down say you're down, if you're scared, say you scared 
This is the real, don't fuck around and come unprepared 
Or you might lose your life on the mean streets 
Middle of the night when the motherfuckin' fiends meet 
Hold your grip tight yo, don't let it slip 
You gotta keep your tool for the fools that want to trip 
And if they want to trip, send em on a vacation 
All expenses paid for a devil's cremation 
Can't be no contemplation, 'cause if he busts first you're gettin' burst, uhh 
Layin' on your back, I guess what I'm sayin, black, is that 
If you ain't down then don't fuck around 
""Is you down, nigga?"" 'cause the shit gets thick in my town 
This ain't a TV show or a song from the radio 
Murder on the streets, yo, is at a high ratio 
So it ain't no time for playin 
You takes the nine and I'ma be sprayin' 
Now what the fuck's this look in your eye? You're lookin' nervous, nigga 
Earlier tonight you was all ready to service, nigga 
Now your trigger ain't got no itch 
You're attitude switch like a motherfuckin' bitch 
I can see through your expression that you're vessin' 
Feelin' crazy pet, lookin' like you want to jet 
But now the shit is obvious, you just can't deal 
I gotta find another nigga down for the real, ""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Are you down for the real? 
Real lifestyle's where niggas run wild 
Day after day the product line is a mile 
A nigga got his eye aimed on what's mines 
I gots ta lay low 'cause my PO is thorough 
He keep checkin' every borough 'cause my address pad is thick 
Niggas be actin wild 'cause they girl be on my dick 
This kid downtown don't like me, he say he want me dead 
He even put up cash and put a price on my head 
At first I can't sweat it but my little man got hit 
We had a lotta thrills but now he's buried in the Catskills 
Rumor has it, that bein' with me's a target 
My crew go less and less and I resort to wearin' a vest 
Ain't got no type of fans, just me and my mans 
We be drawin' up plans that include the use of guns 
Try to stay alive so we can spare no use of funds 
A month or two blows, a whole year blows 
Are we still on our toes as we guzzle all the Moet? 
Two drunken poets as the first shots hit 
My man don't duck quick and gets hit in the chest 
I just got nicked 'cause I had on the vest 
Now I'm dashin', cars in the garage 
Run past the Path' run past the Dodge 
Rumble for the keys, made it to my shit 
The AK can spray now niggas is gettin' hit, ""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Are you down for the real? 

[Chorus]
Are you down for the real, motherfuckers?, ""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Are you down for the real? , ""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Now are you down with the real ass niggas? , ""Is you down, nigga?"" 
Now tell me if you're down for the real? , ""Is you down, nigga?""

You know you gotta make up that loss
So when the cut was butt (?) and the work was dirt
A whole baggage fucked up ?), you know you're de man
You gotta head him off, if you still want the block
So he can look the other way, if he catch you with the Glock
All de cook up, he might give you the hook up (?)
So you don't get moves downtown in the tombs
New gang member, he's a rookie and his wid extortion (?)
He got a wife and his daughter wanna a pony
His man's a Columbian
And they both got they hands in the soup
And you gotta hit off your group
Niggas to be outside til like four in the mornin
Niggas with the toast so when the gang get too close
Naw a gang don't play by the rules and they up they demands
Gotta grease mo hands, gotta get mo work
Gotta get more weight, gotta stay up late
And travel out of state, hey fuck the gang fucks nothin
Niggas are bluffin, as they snatch you for the kidnap they don+t even
Show
Got fucked in the ass, so now who's the ho
Gang 88 (?), mo kinds of dicks, don't give a fuck about the brothers
As long as they get they cash, News flash

Young black male, twenty-five years of age 
Many-a-lives didn't survive to this stage 
'Cause the rage of another brother got him popped 
Shot him and he dropped, like a beanbag 
Mean motherfucker with a rag and some jeans that sag 
They signify your death by crossin' out your tag 
Then they go and brag that they took another life 
Never to think, do a brother got a mother and a wife? 
Trife when a nigga do the work of the Klan 
That's what you're doin' when you ruin the life of a black man 
Attack plan on self 
The man's got the family jewels, so I guess we're buryin' wealth 
All because we've been taught to despise what's black 
Open your eyes you oughta realize the fact 
That you've been gettin used like a trick 
You think you're mighty, but yo, whitey got your head sick 
See you were fed thick pieces of swine as a baby 

It only help to drive your mind crazy 
Now your blind days be over 
No more standin on line, tryin to find Jehovah 
Let us rewind to a time we was right and just 
Nowadays we just fight and bust 
One another in the back over crack, a carjack 
Will get you killed, watch the blood get spilled 
To the scale, then watch how fast they build the jail 
Now they got you holdin' on to a cell, well...

Do you know this girl named nah be	 I don't know nothin' 
Did that name-game shit right from the go get 
Shorty want an autograph, can I sign it at the end 
Oh I think I'm all of that now, so now it's fuck Brand Nubian 
Should I call you a bitch, or should I maintain? 
I'm just here with my lady, and you came witcha man 
This would force him to front, and I'm sure he don't want it 
Over some old bullshit, when I'm quick to pull shit 
Live dad, everything is everything 
I got a lotta shit to do I can't afford to catch a charge 
I'm a product of the streets, and I couldn't make no peace 
All the real hard shit I know, is on the down low 
Straight for real estate, on a scale I place your fate 
Now I'ma let you skate, you was a little weeded 
And I seen you don't need it 
So hold on with your bad self

All the jams we done been through is proof 
We blend truth, with mathematics doin acrobatics over beats 
The sound dramatic when it played in Landrover jeeps 
I know my peeps is in the front of the stage 
Smokin blunts with the strokin stunts, ready to set it 
When the word is given, I know you heard how we was livin 
Never takin no shit, just stayin clever and makin the hits 
Shakin the tits of the honeys when they jump 
Makin money's what we bump 'cause slumps is for chumps

To the niggas from the projects 
Prospect Park in Brooklyn, I'm lookin' at another crime scene 
Committed by the brothers on this rhyme team 
Just freestylin' in a cipher, I take the life of MCs 
If you're wack we got the right to seize 
He's black like Ultra, know your culture 
Motherfuckers don't know so they won't grow 
Lord Jamar show and prove the rules I kick 
Makin niggas move, no matter how smooth it get 
Or how rigid, niggas still get it 
I kill wicked motherfuckers with the rhymes that I structures 
In my third eye, know you heard I 
Study math like a mathematician 
See half of y'all wishin' you could sound like the GODs from the town 
Of the Rule, you ain't got the urge, bust it down Serge 

You know I smoke it like the flame to the tip of that bud, we just twistin' 
From another dimension, did I mention 
That funky, that's the only way we know how to get niggas 
Rhymes belimminent like a partial scholarship 
But my style's so heavy it make you lean when I drop 
Leave you spinnin' like the washin' machine before it stop 
Goin' all out, have to seal these motherfuckers fate 
On a mission from Cleveland, ridin' it from outta state 
So ready yourself because it's on full scale 
I heard some put Jamar to bail down to New Rochelle 
Now Rule, that's where we scheme and we plot 
On the late night, blunted in the basement with Sadat 
And we discussin' your demise, know it's gonna come 
Sure as the sun's gonna rise, send me the drum 
And Serge is buckin' off a shot from the mental insight 
Air tight, throw a worker from cradle to gravesite 

I feel lick a shot pum pum, push up on the one 
Original Flatbush style, and solo jam 
Like beep Han Solo man 
Yes-a, Mr.Intellect-And-Sex in the flesh 
I'm rougher than the hair on your girl's chest 
Maestro Manny one verse, time come in 
My ??? ??? scab when they go flurry 
You don't concern me, your style can't burn me 
You's about as hardcore as Big Bird, Bert and Ernie 
My steelo fat like your girlfriend, pregnant with twins 
After Thanksgiving then they're eatin' pork skin 
I don't give a fuck about your section, just watch your murder flexin' 
Step correct to the brother with the dark complexion 
6' 1"", two weaves and cocked diesel 
You can see that hair is curly, ain't no fuckin' up like ??? 
See!!!! 

When the corrupt stuff in my mind starts to erupt 
Even the hard niggas will be yellin' ""That's enough"" 
But what about my style, ooh child, I switch em up 
Rearrange em up, in other words I change em up 
Snagglepuss, I make a nigga fall like the season 
So exit stage left 'cause you ain't on my level, leaf 
You want to battle? Here's what happened to the last kid 
His wife became a widow and his kids became bastards 
In the rap profession, I'm not the one for testin' 
I'm the first to let'cha know I'm way dirty like mudwrestlin' 
So bring all the flunkies you roll with 
So when I set it on your ache, you all be like ""Oh shit!"" 
You want more so here we go, peep how my rap flow 
I'll have your ass sneakin' out the backdoor 
This is some trouble you don't want to get your ass in 
So watch your step and don't come out'cha mouth in the wrong fashion 

Feel the wind blow through your hair 
My aim is square on your backbone 
You're home alone and your mom work the double shift 
Just enough time for me to hit that off 
""Bounce on a nigga"" said my man Wop 
Peace to the squad, One-Eighth, Fo' and Teepee, check it

For the next couple of seconds or however long it takes
I'ma hit y'all with somethin far below Christ or nothin
Couldn't get a better deal if this was Vegas
Ain't no cards on the table, just a bottle of Black Label
And a picture of your girl who I said was sweatin bullets
Reach for it, pull it, or we'll always have beef
You'll be scared to walk the streets, sweatin up your sheets
You bought a ticket to Jamaica, I caught you at the airport
Blood spilled on your dome, which funeral dome is da
One preferred, all expenses occurred
To the one who sweats the bullet, slugs, thugs and drugs
Or whoever bring it better be able to sing it
'Cause the song of a dead man's a sad one
And a family without a son is a mad one
Sweatin bullets and I know you love your family
But Money you can't scare me or when I'm feelin *?melly?*
You could get over but I'ma bring ya back down
Play ya like a clown, from the brother's ringling
Your spine is tinglin, you can't feel your legs
""Will I ever walk to the doctor?"" you begs
The hot one shattered your spinal vertebrae
Remember that shit that you said the other day
They gotcha style with the dead arm
Take the dead aim and flash your name

I'm sweatin motherfuckers like Jack LeLaine, I packs the pain
I'll rack your brain, leave you in a sack wit your name
Hangin from your toe as I'm bangin your hoe
She'll be slangin pussy down in Magic City, bringin me doe
If you don't know it's Lord Jamar from the Nubian set
No matter who the fuck you are we're puttin down the sweat
Servin heat on a motherfucker's street
Bullets be dripped whiles a motherfucker trippin
You'll never catch me slippin 'Cause I got my rubber soles
The devils make me sick, I'd love to fill em full of holes
Kill em all in the daytime, broad motherfuckin daylight
12 o'clock, grab the Glock while waitin for the night
We sweatin motherfuckin bullets, and if we break a sweat
That means we'll make ya wet
I'll take your life and jet back to some place cooler
Now Ruler is where my burner gets the fueler
If niggas wanna do I got the hollow point teflon
The kind niggas will vest then get laid to rest on
So niggas bring your best on but I suggest you invest on

Now leave the bloody bitch in a ditch
Get'cha pretty penny if the mother of my enemy

And for the lies you told, I'ma buck you in the mouth

Everybody gotta weapon
Who's gonna let burst the first shot? Hmm, I thought not
Feel the battle, tell Darryl that his first-born is dead
Shot in the back by the task force
I'm mistakin' your face in a similar face
Got em murdered
Much like how the buffalo is herded by the pale face
Who threw some game on the Indian, who got jerked for New York

We might throw somethin' that's hollow
Brand Nubian ain't never been the ones, to follow nobody
We gotta lotta arms but I like to pump the shotty

Now what the fuck's this all about?
It's all about brothers risin' up, wisin' up
Sizin' up a situation, but gettin' fit within the nation
No deviation, a straight pathways down my wrath
I sing sounds of math on behalf
Of the Gods and the Earths, birthplace in space
You be fuckin' with my turf when you be fuckin' with my race
Now face, your maker and take your last breath
The time is half past death
Now what the fuck's this all about?

If you're less than a man, in my eyes
Then your head's off, and I'ma set off the wheels
Motherfuck the baby seals or savin' the whales
All the crack sells, it's the armageddon
So cancel the wettin'
Go in the garage, find that old camouflage
Blend in like a mirage and explode
Take nothin' lightly, crackers shootin' nightly

",Back up Off the Wall,1998
Brand Nubian,"Somebody went gold in the Billboard, it was a X, but it was Mia 
Young boys ran to me in the local pizzeria 
He said, ""You Jamar and Haji man y'all hot to death 
Can y'all save what's left, or at least make a claim?"" 

Shorty remind me of myself when I started in this game 
And through years I'm basically the same, as are my brothers 
I'm the eight track flashback before the days of crack 
Is it real or an act, fuck it, let's save the kids 

Yeah you all about war, why you tryin' to die for? 
Yeah them niggaz real raw but you sleepin' on the floor 
Yeah I walk through the Valley with my man Spark and Allie 
Days of money, in Harlem Week '85 
With the Captain's hats, and my father's old guns 

Before I had a daughter, and before they had sons 
I stay the hypnotizer, style's a tranquilizer 
Got you feelin' all loose, wettin' up the goose 
The great Datty X and I'm hear to say 
You can always find me around the way 



Uhh, I be that kid with the dreads that remember 
When I hid from the Feds, plus I always did what I said 
I was gonna do, talk shit, right in front of you 
Never forfeit, on top, we do it non stop 

Remember when we let the bomb drop 
With more jewels than a pawn shop from the school 
Of the hard knocks, straight off the Now Rule block 
Powerful aftershocks with the strength of Master locks 

We got you in a paradox, between a rock and a hard place 
We got the hard bass 
And everybody's gon' get a taste, get your plate 
First we had to let it marinate, now we straight, uhh 

Five mics is how we rate, stand with us 
And stand amongst the likes of the great scandalous 
Cats, try they best to decipher the tape 
What we manifest still gets blessed in every state 

 

Hey listen here dog a nigga keep it spicy hot 
Rhyme flow stay straighter than six o'clock 
Hustle rhymes like a nigga hustle shit on the block 
The shit is work and got a 4.6 in the lot 

I hustle knowledge, charge tuition like a college 
My wisdom hold me down in town like Jackie Brown 
I teach Dangerous Minds, like that chick Michelle Pfeffeir 
That's why the Gods check got at least 6 cypher 

My Justice Cypher Born, I ain't no helpless type nigga 
Like a gat without a trigga I got the figure to make figures 
For years I've been doin this thing I do 
Since Ralph McDaniel's video show was on channel U

Station 31, vice grip channel changer son 
The show was the banger, came in clear with a hanger 
Top notch status watch the God get it flamin'
Herbal with the verbal, drop top twin turbo 
Blazin' for the year, born build to 2 G's 

Flow like these, help the God stack cheese 
Summer Jet-Ski, trunk with TV's 
Sittin' under tropic trees with iced teas 
Mind stay positive black, guaranteed 
To grab the top dollar, more pull than the Rottweiler",The Beat Change,1998
Brand Nubian,"Now a lot of people think this is easy as it looks 
Books and books of rhyme concepts and hooks 
Session to session to get thoughts manifested 
Stressin' and stressin' to hit the world with a blessin' 

Lot of people often ask, ""Puba how you givin' back?"" 
The way I give back is through the knowledge of my raps 
like a gem, for all my people caught out on a limb 
who be givin' in, caught out on a stem, who don't want to win 

""I'm feelin' you I know you gettin' down like that 
but what I'm sayin' Dog is let me hold a little somethin' black! 
I'll hit you back!"" come on dead that, that's the tenth time 
I heard that -- all you know is gimme I work hard for every penny 

that I make -- video and tape 
LP and CD, if I fall, you feedin' me? 
No dough to spread, always keep a level head 
Long as my seeds get fed, it won't go to my head, so.. 

""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
Everybody love a star, when he on top 
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!"" 
Nobody comes around when the star start to drop 

""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
Strive to help others who help themselves 
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"" 
Knowledge of self, and good health and wealth 

The ladies are datin', no question but you can't tell her that 
'Cause subconciously, we put our hand out 
Like I'm that ATM cat, drop me off at Chase 
Earring in the navel like you sex-you-al 

Royalty, while the whole loyalty means [shit] 
Get wreck in the kitchen like she were on the cooking channel 
and didn't have a [nigga] in the car do' 
Got ??? she's a mother to be, I hope they're twins 

Give me a whole tribe 
and be as sexy as Janet was on the cover of Vibe 
She slick talk, playin' you 
well she got a girlfriend that used to tap 

back when, so she always worryin' with you 
Tell her hold it down ma, I give you high ranks 
Sometimes you wild but I guess that's your style 
If you lay up in my high rise, will you stay wise? 

Will the slave thighs open your eyes, girl.. 
""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
Don't believe those jealous type cats 
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!"" 

Cause I'm the one makin' some late night cash 
""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
I told you girl my home is my castle 
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"" 

Understand it won't be no hassle 

I heard your single on the battle of the beats 
It won five nights, I bet you had the time of your life 
Workin' so hard, and so long, to make a record 
Finally to make a song people respected 

Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo' 
Now you hittin' the flo', you never hit befo' 
Got you trippin', how much better could it get? 
Got the leather with the work check, all up in the whip 

They're all legitimate, callin' it what it's really not 
This is just one single you got, that's really hot 
Tomorrow it could bust just like a blood clot 
Leave you in the dust with your body to rot 

Another party to rock, if it's you or if it's me 
it doesn't matter cause it just won't stop 
Don't let your gray matter pop 
'Cause when you release the album 

If they don't cop, you gonna get dropped, so.. 
""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
'Cause one single don't make you a hit 
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!"" 

Stay true to who you are don't never forget 
""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
Keep your feet on solid ground 
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"" 

'Cause what goes up, must come down, uhh 
""Don't let it go your head, no!"" 
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!"" 
""Don't let it go your head, no!""

So get your hands up high, if you feel me reply
'Cause you know these brothers here we keep it extra tight

Look, listen and observe, it took precision to connect
The words of dialect within a rhythm you never heard
Forbidden fruit, take a bite, you could lose your life
Like how they crucified Christ Musa's hair was white
Lord Jamar, Sadat X and Puba's here tonight
We got next on the court, I don't know what you thought
This flow can't be bought, only sold in exchange
For platinum ang gold, you've been told, open up the manifold
Only to reveal scrolls and scrolls
Premeditated to be dedicated to lost souls
Properly educated, never sloppily operated
Playing the beats for all my people incarcerated
We stay in the streets and find new ways to eat
Crime wave, I remember wetting my feet
In my blind days, now these niggas getting they heat
From under they seat, I wonder when the guns'll deplete

New millennium we don't mess around
Do the knowledge as we blaze the situation, so just feel me now

I'm in a rush, who got the keys to my truck?
Who am I? I just might be a spy
I drop a tear at the sight of the blue NY
I'm a threat just like Garnette
Pick a player out my set like Marbury
Serve me sherry with a cherry
I always eat what you think
I ain't got no shoes on my feet, I'm from down the street, huh
Now cats ride around New York with the slick hot rods
Some late model usually pushing full throttle
Hanging illegal U's and staying with the gleaming shoes
Riding one deep but back to back to back
Fuck a buzz, it's gonna happen just because
Sure I was with her was, but I don't know what she does
Big dimes hit me everytime like it's a crime
My prime will steadily climb
Yeah, I can't release nothing to y'all before it's time

Go-getters we be superb like Justin's catfish fritters
Now I got 2000 flows, only 4 less than all of my hoes (*Hey!*)
Oops I mean my bro's but I'm just keeping y'all on your toes
Excitement for your enlightenment, spitting novels, getting bravos
Tear it up like El Nino, keeping it hotter than jalapenos
Microphone holder doing more damage than rolling boulders
Rhyme style should've fooled ya, knocked your head right off your
Shoulders
See my intention, black-on-black prevention, break the tension
Teach the seeds, tell them what they need and then collect my pension

Uh huh, come on, check it out, check it out, what?

Uh, like that, like that, what? ""Say it loud"" ""I'm black and I'm proud"" 
Come on, come on, come on, come on ""Say it loud"" 

We made men in this world, digging for bones 
The untraceable ones come with no clones 
A hundred years from now y'all can still get this bomb 
On the Brand Nubian dot com 
My name should be mentioned with the Portier, not the Gualtier 
Although it smell good, I still get mad at Rosewood 
A Nubian card member since that faithful December 
In the eighty years, from tears to cheers, things we did should be listed 
In a pyramid, studied by a little kid 
Talked about by old jacks with slacks 
Can I move the black is my first and foremost 
Can I get a little land for me and mine? 
Grow vegetables, maybe make a little wine 
Build with the Gods and the bright sunshine 
Before we save others we gotta save our own kind

""I'm black and I'm proud"" ""Say it loud"" ""I'm black and I'm proud"" 
""Say it loud"" ""I'm black and I'm proud"" ""Say it loud"" ""I'm black and 
I'm proud"" 
""Say it loud"" 

Now did you know it was you who was first to walk the Earth 
Gave birth to the Universe, uh 
Afflicted with the curse of the slave 
Predicted to inherit the earth in the last days 
Now as we take you home, what we make our own 
It's written in stone like Commandments 
Read them every now and then or when you get the chance 
Catch a glance through the power lens, see if you could see us advance 
G-O-D in the dance, reporting freelance 
Fought for a chance, got you hanging by the seat of your pants 
Our immediate stance when we came to the game 
Was completely advanced so no one sounds the same 
Seven and one-half ounces of brain 
When we around make sure you bow down to the king 
Brand Nubian style is how we do our thing 
So if you feel good, real good 
Scream it out loud if you black and you proud 

[Chorus]

Feel me now, check my style 
A brother's resume run longer than the Nile 
Justice cipher born to teach man, woman and child 
In the land of the lost where my people went foul 
Do the knowledge, black, look at the way that we act 
Smoking crack or each other with the gat 
The only race of people who kill self like that 
I deal with actual facts to keep my mind on track 
I love y'all that's why I say these things 
Watch me transform chickenheads to queens 
Rhymes full of protein like rice and beans 
Brand Nubian cats here to change all that 
The maker, the owner, the cream of the Earth 
Proud to be black because the black man's first 
My flow frequency is at a million megahertz 
So when I spit my verbals I'm heard around the Universe (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
So don't front, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud

Uhh.. 

Now it's love, vs. hate 

Time for my people to eliminate 

that hate, let's love 

Because it's our people that we're thinking of 

Now they say we playa hatin cause we hate the black on black 

And the fact we can't stand when we act like that 

Self-hate killin us more than the Po-Po or crack 

I tell my peoples with the gats it ain't about all that 

We arrived on slave ships, tortured chained and whipped 

Four hundred years of bein slaves in the land of the brave 

Have we forgotten? Our ancestors forced to pick cotton 

Women raped and tortured, murdered if they caught ya 

Niggaz swung from trees like a breeze do summer leaves 

Swayin back and forth, failed attempts to make it North 

Millions of people died just so that we can survive 

So this knowledge I provide cause these facts can't be denied 

Nowadays it's new ways, sixties it was the smack 

Eighties it was the crack, nineties it be the gat 

Time to recognize how uncivilized we got 

Get wise and unify and not fall victim to the plot

bust the other way instead of at the brother next to us? 

That's all that they expect from us, police stand by 

Don't believe the lie that they're the ones protectin us 

Projects, to see how poverty's affectin us 

Robberies, we lust objects of high quality 

or so we think we slowly sink into the quicksand 

With no support, like a bike that doesn't have a kickstand 

We stay in court, smoke Newport's, and fail to support 

our seeds, with no thoughts for they needs 

We fought for the cheese and all it got us was a grave 

or a bid as a slave, we live in the land of the brave 

where the home isn't free, grown niggaz be 

in a zone, tryin to act out the TV 

We cracked out and greedy with a lack of respect

I tell her it's in our lesson, for him to know himself 

To me the greatest wealth is the best of health 

When the music stops, I'll play the role like my pops 

and his pops and so on I got a legacy to go on 

I'll watch out for my babies and I'll kill for em 

And if they want to receive the knowledge

All it seems to be is sadness and pain 

Blood like rain clogs urban drains

Your daily mechanism is your defense, whether it be 

past or present tense, don't be dense

Poisoned by society where high-anxiety is just one variety

Since the days of Kemet, now displayed on Bennett 

Revolution's like a pussy, I'm tryin to stay up in it 

And our music is a message, though some is afraid to send it 

I don't know much about the New World Order; I know I 

Got a new daughter, direction and protection I must provide for her 

The moral of the story I'm building... 

Like ODB say, ""We for the children"" 

Nike make a killin off us, we kill each other, it kills me to see that 

You take a life for gold, nigga did you really need that?

In this era of prepaid calling cards 

I roll with squads called the Gods 

Ignorance is at large, struggles in our backyard 

I slapbox with life and see we wasn't that hard 

Long as you got God, even got Gramps off lah 

It's stray lies and bullets directed, to lead the village 

of lies disconnected like ghetto phones 

Fuck a search through a magazine for Better Homes 

It ain't gonna happen 

Til the devil's gone with the breeze 

and niggas get off they knees so...

Now who's this nigga in the 4.6?
About twenty to five, got a truck full of chicks
Just leavin the disco, me and my man from the knicks
Oak dog, later on because they live in the bricks
Jumped on the george washington and now jeru' turnpike
Head feelin right from a long-ass night
Whoa, I see jake, so I let off the gas
So I was doin fifty-five when I passed his ass
I looked over, caught the shine from the rim of the rover
You know his next move (*police siren*) pull it over
I pulls over to the right-hand shoulder
Look through the rearview he got his hand on his holster
He had this look, ""how this black nigga get this car? ""
You know these cracker state troopers don't know rap stars
He asked me for license and my registration
Seen my new york tags and he asked me my destination
I said, ""vacation,"" handed him my registration
Papers were straight so I didn't wet the situation
Got my shit back, and that was that, but that wasn't that
'Cause in fact, I got stopped two more times black

'Cause new york state, and they child care rate
Miss judge lady in a courtroom can dictate
A fee for me, to pay monthly
Even suggested, that I be arrested, they don't count
The time invested or the bond beyond the money
They'll hit you with arrears, bad enough to bring tears
They been on my back for years, fuckin with my license
And everytime I'm stopped by dick I see the booking
That making me violent in this wilderness land
Now can we talk for a minute? cause we both made this child
Can we leave support alone, please take me offa that file
'Cause everytime I see the court my blood pressure rise
And the heart attack is a killer of black guys, I stay civilized
Maintain, sometime restrain myself
A court officer is near me, but I think he fear me, cause it's
Probable cause (uh-huh) probable cause
You don't have to break no laws
They just say probable cause

For all my niggaz po-po shot in the back
Robocops with the crack, they'll never get props
From the black folks, lock us up while they crack jokes
And stack notes, when we payin the bail
Knowin damn well a nigga's gonna stay in the jail
It's all made for us to fail, the dog is smarter
Than the tail, but if the tail was smarter it would wag the dog
I can't wait til we bag the hogg

We even got our own converting across the line
He turned swine, guess his ass'll learn when he burn

Couldn't believe it when he took me in
Threw me and my man up in the van, a seven hour stand
Ridin around watchin them arouse the black man
I had the afghan I just copped from the record shop
Took it up the block my usual spot, when i
Rolled the l, I never expected to go to jail
I wish they'd all go to hell
Now guiliani wanna talk about the ""quality of life""
Think he got the right to follow me at night
With no probable cause, other than my skin is black like yours
Now they got me in the beast, sittin right in his jaws
Up in central booking, yo people looking knowing that
I'm in the rap game, and I got trapped the same way they did

Uhh, now it started it off for me in apartment 6C 

Project style, ate government cheese for a while 

Pop Duke wasn't there 'cause he had to do a bid 

so momma love stuck with these bad ass kids 

She used to say keep your head up, always think positive 

and never be ashamed of who you are or where you live 

Teenage years I had to struggle doing that 

Shorty say ""Don't talk to him, girlfriend, look where he live at 

Crib probably crawlin with roaches and rats 

plus cats be in his hallways with the drugs and the gats"" 

I used to try and honeys used to walk on by 

Now I'm damn near 20 and still ain't got no ride 

Caught a record deal, now them same old chicks that used to walk on by 

go out their way to say hi 

But they gets none

Not fiending enough to go out and grab bags from women 

I swear if we don't hear this on the air 

I'll be down at the station 

Your broadcast from Monday has now been switched to no day 

With the class team that I'm with, we stay fit

employ black faces from midnight blacks to light tan

A four-letter word seldom heard amongst my nation

They got us willing to be killing off our population, full-time occupation 

We need to turn it around like oscillation 

or watch it all burn to the ground from frustration 

Lord Jamar, I'ma show love to all my people who show 

To me that's how it's gotta be

This one goes out to all the black woman across 

the whole planet Earth, givin our black nation birth 

Nothin in this universe is worth your worth 

So we dedicate this song, black woman 

[Lord Jamar] 

This one is for every woman I was ever with 

The ones that I cared about and ones I just wanted to hit 

I feel ashamed for all the times that I called you a bitch 

And I, know I was wrong, can you ever forgive? 

The negative, we used to use sex as a sedative 

I abused your respect for me 

I would choose to react disrespectfully 

Never thinkin the impact would come back to me 

Now I'm the son, and I know you're my reflection 

Let me give you love and my protection 

Proper education Allah's correction 

Eternal lies, within your eyes 

I hope you realize that I apologize, for all the lies 

I never meant to make you cry - all the mistakes that I 

may have made, and games that I played 

Been put to an end, black women 

Let me take this time, to let you know 

You've been on my mind, and even though 

I always haven't been kind 

I want to show you that you really divine, sincerely

Now she's the most beautifullest thing in creation 

She give me motivation causin constant elevation 

Seein more than booty used in lustful situations 

So feel the vibrations, she's the mother of our nation 

Now for oh so long you stood by us so strong 

even when we done wrong, so I dedicate this song 

More priceless than a worldly treasure, you bring 

love joy pleasure, countless things that are unmeasured 

Some raise seeds all alone with no father in the home 

but they still find the strength to continue on 

I see you more than a crackhead or a chickenhead 

or just a piece of somethin I'm tryin to get up in my bed 

You often say a lot of times we demean 

Sometimes we do to lift the hardhead ones up to queens 

Our whole purpose is to give a proper surface 

cause the black woman always is a queen 

Let me take this time, to let you know 

You've been on my mind, and even though 

I always haven't been kind 

I want to show you that you really divine, sincerely

My fondest thoughts and memories go out witchu 

And I'm sorry for that time that I hit you 

The finest lights you radiate, you lookin bright 

And that's why I love you with the chocolate skin 

Finer things were never made in this world 

There you are lookin like somethin worth somethin 

Make me feel pride when you walk with me 

Sit down and talk with me, for a minute 

It's kinda hard for me not to stray 

But I think I'm gonna start today 

Hey I'm tryin, at least I ain't lyin

Send a rose to your wife, she probably saved your life 

Put up with cheatin and she mighta got beaten

Brand Nubian,"Straight outta Now Rule, Brand Nu keepin' cool 
We drop a jewel and never stoppin' what we do 
Always do what we must, everything that we touch 

A lot of y'all niggas is 85th, on some shady shit 
Bark is much worse than your bite like a baby pit 
In the pitch dark of the night you's afraid to get exposed 
Like the sunlight which rose in the morning 
Froze in a gunfight, forcing those who run with you to reevaluate affiliations 
We salivate from hunger, placed in fucked up situations 
And wonder when retaliation will occur 
Build destroy H-he or her 
It's time to fill the void, niggas kill the noise 
To the young boys, you fuckin' with a grown-ass man 
Watch your tone or get acquainted with the back of my hand 
Nubian Brand steadily influencin' fans 
For other rappers we gon' ruin your plans 
What we doin' stands as a motto 
Like Grace Jones' nipple to the bottle 
We pioneer and never follow 
We're out for the lion's share now watch me take it there 

Yeah, my verbal clarity speaks for my popularity 
Sell five million CDs and give the proceeds to my favorite charity 
Son, I ain't gonna super splash you with no Fantasy Island shit 
I mean I work hard for what I got and I be thankful for what I get 
And if you practice, spit your verbs properly, not sloppily 
Like monopoly, you can end up with cheese, whips and property 
Oh damn, silly of me, I forgot to let y'all know 
It's one thing you should never do in this game and that's sell your soul 
I make a lot of sense then I go and make the dollars 
Work hard like blue collars, ghetto scholars is hard to follow 
Niggas say it's real rough today and I say what you say 
They promised me forty acres and a mule and all I got was a project and a  subway 
I stay positive, niggas mistake that for not hard 
Nigga I'm God, walk through North America like Master Farrad 
Me and my squad, separating the peas from the pod 
No bodyguard, fuck around and roll a tank through your yard 

[Chorus]

Yeah 
Man, these dick-in-the-butt rappers could get shot in the face 
Dragged through the streets and probably left some place 
I seem shootouts in the park 
Ball games turned tragic, bitch niggas gettin' smacked and smacked again 
In front of they girl, and she's throwing away that ass 
And I ain't really asked for it 'cause a lot of niggas tore it 
And yes, my man Hav had bought me something from VA 
I was gonna hit him with doe but he ain't reall want no shorts 
'cause we had worked together and he knew I was true blue 
Man, I swore I would never go to VA again 
Until I found out who killed my best friend 
I can tell by the wind somebody's gettin' ready to bend 
They lifestyle's bout to end 
I'm in these African cabs on stores run by the Arabs 
With pictures of yen, seem like they schemin' 
Herculoid cats get flattened and reduced to pitchin' 
That girl gave you crabs but I can't explain those scabs

Now I got the best birthday present when my ass born 
It was my mama, old dad plant the seed like a farmer 
Life was kind of hard livin in hell's backyard 
Didn't have a job, honey fronted on the GOD 
Shorty racing, only hollering at cats who be lacin 
She had some shit with her, she was caught up in the glitter 
""Brother come see me when you get five digits bigger"" 
Oh that's the way you tryin to doo-doo on a nigga

Play the knees for the cheese like a savage 
Now she lost and turned out, rotten teeth in her mouth

The other kid said he was gonna get his father 
I didn't bother to respond 'cause I knew that you was gone 
Forced to carry on and teach myself right from wrong 
As far back as I can remember you was never around 
In September it was back to school 
The eldest member of my family so I packed the tool 
It made a nigga feel manly when I smacked a fool 
With it, could've schooled me on pussy before I hit it 
Or took me to a park with a ball and said ""Hit it"" 
But we was all left in the dark, accepting the parts 
Of you we was able to get, affectin my heart 
Nowadays you expecting to start, anew 
When I lived my whole life apart from you 
Too late you better check the due date 
See there's no explanation for the expiration 

Too late, too late baby, bye-bye 
I'll be there tonight 
You'll get left behind

Niggas disrespect my crib droppin' ashes on the floor 
Another half of beer I'm findin' behind the chair 
Let you meal like you wish but you can't even wash a dish 
but you love to eat and rest them stink ass feet 
And blow up my telephone line like you was home 
Seen a nigga make five quick calls to the dome 
Ride around all day, 'Dro-ed or hash 
I ain't never heard once ""Can I help you with gas?"" 
I ain't never heard ""X, can I buy you a meal?"" 
But if we going downtown niggas is ready to wheel 
Now if you broke you broke, you got five dollars, give me one 
'Cause most likely I'll give it back before the day is done 
If I'm spendin and bending, you should do it pendin 
That day when you break out and finally get your cake 
But I don't let that stress me 'cause life is but a test, be	 
And every waken day, I'ma stay okay

Like comstock, wit more shoes than a Foot Locker 
And it don't stop, Diamond D and Brand Nu 
Baggin more chickens than that nigga Frank Purdue 

No more domestication, on some over-seas shit 
Beat a nigga ass till he says ""please quit"" 
While you home alone marinatin' on cheese sticks 
I'm in the back of the 'Burban wit some Chinese chicks 
Lookin' at a map, one chick on my lap 
Tellin' me how she was born in the year of the rap 
But by the time we reach the house, there's no waitin' in fact 
All you see is ankles (yeah what) from the front to the back

Brand Nubian,"Brand Nubian function
A junction of three
Collaborating in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms
Tap a soul
'Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo Black it's kinda ill
We don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is ""Brand Nu""
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
400 years and we're made to feel cursed
But now it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

You have to stand as a black man
Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of my force
See me riding on a jet black horse at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel

Brand Nubian
Not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind deaf dumb and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold
(The black, the beautiful, the bold)
Now if this falls short I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasa Kuma, Ahmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To put it exact dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel

A member of one of a group of African tribes that formed a poweful
Empire between Egypt and Ethiopia
From the 6th to 14th century

Any of several languages spoken in the central and northern Sudan
And that's why we call ourselves Brand Nubian

Well I build like a mason, facin' the East
Brought West, to the belly of the beast
Pro-test, because this land ain't just
I seek equality and freedom is a must
Now if understand is understood well that's good
On equal planes we can bring forth gain
Rise the dead, from the graves of slaves
Fly the head, of the men in the caves
Try instead, to unify with our own plan
Why do we fear, the devil now that he's a grown man
'Cause he bought you, taught you how to eat the wrong food
But now it's time for fasting
Life everlasting, offer thy I-self
Lord and master and all things in my circumference
Lord Jamar makes a difference
I have no tolerance for black ignorance
I keep striving, driving 'cause I'm driven
By the course of Allah, the true and living
Cream of the planet earth God of the universe
The first soul, black like coal
That's how old, there's no set birth record
The devil couldn't check it even if he wants to check it
The Nubians wreck it, all will respect it
So I think we'll go ahead with Knowledge Knowledge

What I provide will collide with devilish ways of thinking
Erasing false facts that started, with Abe Lincoln
Being great, used his weight, and freed the slaves
But did he free us?
Take a look around
At the black man, see us
Illiteracy rules, they showin' cartoons in school
They're way understaffed, and I don't understand the math
Now the way the system works the black man can get the purchase
Drop the family, it neutralizes many
Like wards of the state, doin' one to ten in Dan Amora
The welfare system can create a black horror
Now some people need the money but others, they can manage
By doin' this they take away the cats who disadvantaged
And the long list grows, more dependency bodes
This creates a cycle but a cipher unequal
This is the wrong circle that contains the black people
Now the way devil got us is the way the devil want it
He try to hold us back and he overly floss it
This ain't even his land the Indians was here first
The savagery displayed made the red man disperse
I'm out to squash the whitewashed brainwashed line of thought
I got a million books and a school in the fort
In the Rule, with three great teachers
God Sincere made it clear is also a great feature
So beware devil man the days of purge is almost over
The army's on the range, you think it's kind of strange
Nubians is in the picture, Armageddon's gonna hit ya

Well here I go from the tippy so those who want to flow
Let's go, steppin' in stride as I move with pride
Blind deaf and dumb the God Haji's here to guide
Follow me now children
For wisdom, I always seem to give a conniption
Unlike a pimp, I'm more like an Egyptian
Straight to the Kingdom is where I bring them
And I school 'em, Now Rule is where I rule 'em
He Allah, God Islam, now act
But let me slow down 'cause Eighty-Fives can't get with that
It's Haji, helpful to another God in need
(Word is bond) True indeed
The devil is the one who dare not to knight us
Brought forth the plan on how to divide us
Jamaicans, Christians eatin' bacon, when I greet my brothers
I say, ""Asalaam alaikum""
So I, strive to my duty for the better of the black man
Everywhere you look the black man is on the map and
Here comes a Nubian to give a hand and feed a land
When I drop my bomb it's headin straight for the colored man
Known as Asiatic confrontation causes static
Might I add, I sincerely love Allah's Mathematic
So let's move on, the mental of the black man has been taught
I feel it's my Justice Cypher Bond to keep on
I come to reach one
Each one teach one, so here I come to the drum
Pull it back one time, pull it back 
'Cause see the purpose of me comin'
Is to give a third eye to the blind
For years we fought, the blind's been taught, the chains in thought
But this time, black man we're takin' no shorts
Can't be used as a tool, nor as a slave
Here comes the God to send the devil right back to his cave

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""

A single thing that we went through 
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.

I'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think 
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink 
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong 
I'm gonna play this song 
Make some coffee black and strong 
Give thanks for healing time 
Finally make up my mind 

These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you. 
Baby my cryin's through, I'm moving on. 
I don't regret and won't forget 
A single thing that we went through, 
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you 
These are the last tears?I?m gonna cry for you.

Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you

Swam all across the ocean blue

You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what
I've been through like you do

Under my watchful eye
Because I'm your hero and you're my weakness

When the spinning starts
The colors bleed together and fade
Was it ever there at all
Or have I lost my way

To twice their weight in tears which I have caused

I know that I'm supposed to step away
But they need me to stay and keep a watchful eye
On all my heroes and all their demons

Brandi Carlile,"Time of day I can't recall
The kind of thing that takes it's toll
Over years and over time
Over smiles and over wine

All in all it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody will pick me up
And carry me again

Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride and joy
I believe this to be true
Nothing sacred nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings only signs
And you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought
Can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to

Must have have been new years. no one invited you, 
Took things too far but I missed you and your antics. 
You were lonesome and blue-eyed and so special to us.

You could have taken a long break 
Instead of a long drop from a high place. 
Ten years I never spoke your name. 
Now it feels good to say it. your my friend again.

Said he forgave you, I said I hated you, 
He was the bigger man, I was sixteen. 
All the innocence it took well I guess 
You finally made the year book. 
That year.

Why must my heartache be found

Brandi Carlile,"Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come with talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
To stir the sound of silence

Fool, said I, you do not know, silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words and I might teach you, take my arms then I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they'd made
And the sign flashed its warning in the words that it was forming
And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence,2011

If I get it through my head

I always think about you

Brandi Carlile,"I love the songs I hated when I was young
Because they take me back where I come from
When every broken heart seemed like the end
When everyone was someone different then

But I can't be alone in a crowded room
Where my thoughts, they run like water down a flume
There are days when I will let the darkness rise
I don't always choose to stay on the sunny side

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

Yes, my life has seen some wasted time
I have suffered for the peace inside my mind
And some things are better left unsaid
While some things work out different when they're in your head

But I'm not sorry for the things I say
Sometimes I let my mouth just run away
And I believe that all souls are born kind
And that all love lost comes back in time

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

And even if the world is really round
And all the maps are painted upside down
So if you stand in one place for too long
Everything around you will be gone
Well, I'm not gonna miss you when I'm gone
Now the part of me that's left wants you to know
That I'm not gonna jump towards the light
The ones who believe choose life

Brandi Carlile,"I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea

But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind

But most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm far into the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south

But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever

But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where you're gonna run?

Let it burn you to sleep

Brandi Carlile,"He wasn't really known for breaking the rules
When he arrived in the second year of my high school
He wasn't so much of a twist of fate
As a short turn up from a Southern state
He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat
Always trying to find himself something sweet
All that he found was a trouble and me
Or maybe trouble just found him

It was hard to hide that his heart had scars
He would stay up late talking to the stars
People tried to blame him for making bad choices
When he was only listening to the voices
And searching for some kind of deeper truth
Between the lines and the Bible and living proof
There's no point now to judge him in vain
If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

His life became more than he could take
He found a bad habit he couldn't break
Nothing could tame him and nothing could hold him
He only took the pills when the doctor told him

Looking to help for the something sweet
To make his life feel less incomplete
What in the hell are you gonna do
When the world has made its mind up about you?

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
Then life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

They found him lying on his bed
With a gun in his hand and a quiet head
His broken heart, now, is finally gone
But I know that he had to hurt for too long
To think he had fought it all on his own
Just to lose the battle and die alone
After so many years of feeling the loss
He finally made his way back home

And I heard they put what was left in a box
And took it to a place called Jesus Rock
And scattered him all over jagged mound
As a symbol to all that the piece had been found
But not for a sign is left behind
With a hand stuck reaching back in time
To a place in which you can never unwind
I hope he found something so sweet

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
But life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back

I don't believe we've ever even met
If there's a God in heaven, you can show me
Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet
There are moments I could hold you forever
And there are moments that lasted way too long
There are days when I change with the weather

And a hard one ahead of me, too

With nothing on my breath to hold the night

But at the moment, only demons come to mind

Or roll or roll down a bat, wonder what blow your mind

and they keep runnin back to the plate
We get it on, get it out the pot
Get on the block, and get it gone
Raised up out of the factories, and then we sit it chrome
Ya won't show, get out doors even if it's ice-cold
And slice O's as the dice rolls, shit
And may Lord have mercy on your hustlin-ass soul

Be delivered from the depths of darkness
And born again by candlelight
And born again by candlelight

And tell him that my heart is true
I'd like his blessing of forgiveness before the angels send it through

And I will dance and the band will play
In the old out to cantina
Cause we'll runneth over the ancient clay

When you're in the cage
And you can smell the rain
And you can see the sagebrush

All the clouds blew away
Got no trouble today

With sorrow
Here's a little time
We can borrow

Forget all our troubles
In these moments so few
Oh, we can right now the only thing
That all that we really have to do

Is have ourselves a heavenly day
Lay here and watch the trees sway
Oh, can't see no other way, no way, no way

Bringing me fears
Got no clouds up above me

It's all that I can do

Tried to peak inside the studio's
And somewhere along the way I bought you flowers
And a pocket map of the Underground

Late July humidity
Doctor's said I was lucky to be alive

Trouble to the day that I disappear
That'll be the day that I finally get it right

There is hope for me yet
Because God won't forget
All the plans He's made for me
I'll have to wait and see
He's not finished with me yet
He's not finished with me yet

I never really was that good in school
I talked too much, I broke the rules
Teachers thought I was a hopeless fool, alright

I don't know how but I made it through
Just one of those things that you gotta do
I always had a knack for telling the truth

Still wondering why I'm here
Still wrestling with my fear
But oh, He's up to something
And the farther on I go
I've seen enough to know that I'm not here for nothing
He's up to something

So now's my time to be a man
Follow my heart as far as I can
No telling where I'm ending up tonight
I never slow down or so it seems
But singing my heart it's one of my dreams
All I gotta do is hold on tight

They wonder how long.
And the shepherds,
Wise men come to find them,
And bow to a king.

And the world didn't know that truth was as pure as a child.

Brandon Henderson,"Scared as hell and on my own
Without so much as a telephone
Questioning every single choice I have made
I hang my clothes and I make my bed
Recall a phrase that my father always said
As I embark on this winding, one man parade
He said, ""Waters never part until you get your feet wet.""
It was heavy on my heart as I stood on the beach at sunset
In every other place I feel I'm lost and wandering around
But California's where I'm found
I hang my last picture on the wall 
As all the rest have begun to fall
I hope this move doesn't prove to be a mistake
As hours pass I feel reassured
My mind is eased but its doubt is far from cured
At least I know that these steps are all mine to make
And waters never part until you get your feet wet
It was heavy on my heart as I stood on the beach at sunset
In every other place I feel I'm lost and wandering around
Now all my time has been spent on getting through
Now my poor myind has been bent on getting to
That place where sea reflects sky
A wondrous blue
Somehow I know that's where my dreams will come true
Buit waters never part until you get your feet wet 
It was heavy on my heart as I stood on the beach at sunset
In every other place I feel I'm lost and wandering around
But California's where I'm found
Where I'm found

You write her love letters, I buy her ice and pearls
So how you like me now
Even Roxanne's in the backround saying wow Bling's got style
I'm off the gold chain
If you're a rapper why is Kris your back up dancer like an extra on soul train
I see your mommy and your daddy in the front row
They must be embarrassed for you bro
You're not a real MC
You should quit hip hop
Now be a good bus boy and go get your mop

Bling, you don't wanna battle
You're the snake without the rattle
You're the boat without the paddle
You're the duck without the waddle
You're the horse without the saddle
The ranch without the cattle
The day without the shadow
Son, I think you should skedaddle 
Kick gravel, sayonara punk arrivederci
What language do I have to say it in for you to hear me clearly 
Adios amigo, you're over with finito 
This clown couldn't rap anything but my burrito 

Kid, you have to hold your mommy's hand before you cross the street
You have to sneak out the house just to clean and sweep
And now you look queasy
I made him go mute
Put your camera phones up so you can post this on youtube
Truth's got a screw loose, he's terrified to bus 
So lightweight that I could blow him over with a gust 
You're weak like seven days, you deserve boos
You should walk around in some high heel shoes, ha
You should rock pigtails and a skirt
You're shaking in your boots, are your feelings getting hurt
Ooh well, maybe I should hurt more than your feelings 
Maybe I should rip the roof off the theater ceiling
Maybe you should start kneeling his eyes are getting misty
Your so whack if you were me you couldn't diss me
Kissy kissy Roxanne did you miss me
I'll take you out to dinner after I've eaten this pip squeak
And when were on vacation I'll let him house sit
Here's a couple bucks buy yourself a better outfit

You know what? 
You don't have a stack of cash you're a flashy pad
I saw you last week driving the taxi cab
Your secret's out, and now they know sport
We'll call you if we need a ride to an airport
In fact, you can drop me off at home after this
Then you can take your couple bucks back, but as a tip
You're playing yourself like solitaire
Telling everyone that's here that you're a millionaire 
You're not a baller, you're a phony
I bet your whole crew is a bunch of rent-a-homies
And now you lie in bed lonely
Your persona's a fade 
The only girls you get are in the pages of a catalog 
Here stands lord of the bluff
His lies were legendary til the truth made him hush
And what's funny is your truth is enough
Why'd you have to make up all the money and the stuff
I guess it's easier to play the role and act hard

I ain?t stopping you anymore

You?re about to say something that you can?t take back

So there?s nothing I can do but draw a line down the middle

Of the living room floor, and it?s all going down between here and the front door

But this time you?re staying for good, hey I?d help you if I could

Before I knew your name, I had my pride in tact

To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind

Put the hammer down, listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But it?s one step closer to you, being gone

I gave you the tools but you broke every single rule
Every time I turn around, I'm running back straight to you
Well, I'm broken and twisted, tired of dancing around
Pick me up, throw me down, pull me in, throw me out again

I don't know where you are
Or if you'll ever find what you need to
But come home when you do

Brandon Rogers,"Long ago
There was this pretty young thing from across the way
We used to go
To and fro, home and school about every day, but?
Closest thing we ever had to a date
Was the time we spent together being late 
Walking down the hall on our way to homeroom 

But we were really young back then
So I guess I never noticed the time she took
To brush her hair and fix her clothes to make sure she looked
Like a princess everyday for me and
She was waiting for me 
To do something 
But I did nothing
Cause I was too blind to see
That I was just a boy and
She was my joy 

Everything that I could need
She was so much more
Wonder if I?ll ever see her (Knock, Knock)
Knocking at my door
She was my joy?
Joy?.Joy?Joy?Joy

I Wish I could
Go back in time and treat her a little better
Because I would?
Maybe tell her how I feel; I could put it in a letter saying
?J-O-why because I like you,?
?A-be-see me in the yard after school?
And I?d hold her close
Maybe give her my coat if it was cold outside

But we were really young back then
And I guess I never noticed the time she took
To brush her hair and fix her clothes to make sure she looked
Like a princess everyday for me and
She was waiting for me 
To do something 
But I did nothing
Cause I was too blind to see
Joy (cont?d)

That I was just a boy and
She was my joy 

Chorus

Bridge
It was so long ago
But I still see it like yesterday
We were walking alone 
You were singing a song
I had my chance
I let it pass 
And I?ll never get it back again
I wonder how you?ve been my friend

I can?t help but think about what could?ve been
Would our lives be the same
A whole world of difference
From one tiny change
I don?t know what I?d give up
I don?t know if you?d live up
To my great expectations
Of you?

Chorus
",Joy,2006
Brandon Rogers,"Chorus
Say what you want about me cause
If I can?t give you what you need, 
Then you should be movin? on
Keep movin? on
Say what you want about me but
At least I know what I need
And if you can not give it to me
Then I?m movin? on?

Don?t you come at me with words you don?t understand
Like love, and trust and then
Turn and walk away
Like you got the upper hand (not again)
My dad he told me that if you got something to say
Gotta have the strength to say it to his face
So why do I hear all this talking in the background
Saying how you don?t want me?

Chorus

Did you think I wouldn?t find out about your friend?
And I know where all your time?s been spent
You?ve been walking round, like you?re single now
You should?ve just told me
But now I know that you can?t be trusted at all
No longer will I wait for you to call me
Back in the day you were all that I needed but
You were decieving me?
So you can say?

Chorus

All the time I wasted wondering where the hell you?ve been
All the lies you told I?m never falling for it again
Cause I?ve been there and I?ve done that
And you?ll never get the chance to win me back
Cause I gave you all I had
And all you did was treat me bad
I?m sick and tired of your games
I?ll never be the same
So say what you want to
Cause I?m moving on baby

I?m not the kind of guy
Who takes things lightly

I feel desire

Oh, I?ve been trying to hide it
But I can?t deny it
You don?t know what you do to me

I wanna take you out
Wine and dine you
And then lay you on my couch
Play out our fantasies
But for now it?s just a dream

I should?ve told you before
But I was too scared to show
What was really on my mind
Come to think of it, 
You must be blind if you didn?t know
Now, we?ve been friends for a while
But the time has come for us
To push things forward
Sometimes you?ve gotta take chance
If you wanna find out how a real man

Now, some people say that
I?m just a fool
To try and change something
That was already perfect
They say it?s not worth it

I know you?re feeling me
Baby let me your fantasy
That?s how it?s supposed to be

We have the papers we need to arrest him
You know his movements, we know the law

Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded

We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him

With no crowd around him

Then we can't fail

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good

I don't need your blood money

Think of the things you can do with that money

We've noted your motives, we've noted your feelings

Brandtson,woke up slow this morning to quiet walls and a sunlight flood. this place it seems so empty and everything except for this wait has left me. try not to dwell on this time. how long can it last? hold your breath and close your eyes. the pain will pass. try to rise above the distance of all that you want and soon you'll know the why. why and for what. for the sake of a love like no other. for something we've never known. for the hope of another chance at happiness. we forsake. i've watched the colors fade where windows cast their shape. the same way i have changed in the light of these dark days. i believe in happiness and in love that never fails but the longer i wait here the more they just seem like a fairy tale. i need you to save me. you seem beyond a stones throw. helpless hands tied. i try but this garden's overgrown on the inside. try to rise above the distance of all that i want and remember the why. why and for what.,Still Life,1998

You're wonderful.

Is like playing with broken glass.
I'm fighting off the memories
And all the living in the past.

The pictures on the wall.
The sound of little footsteps
That echo through the hall.

Sound like a heart beat.
It's like a heart beat
It's like a heart break beat
And it's beating out of me.

You know, who just don't feel like they fit into this world

That know that everything is spinning out of control.

You just gotta say ""Hey, na na.""

That we know we've never met
But feel just like we do.
Here we go!
Well, this is our way of letting you know
That we know how bad it is
And that you're not alone.
And it goes a little something like this,
As simple as it is,
You just gotta say ""Hey, na na.""

Success is in the
Process.

I'm sitting in my car and I wonder
Where I'll be a year from now
For the life of me I can't imagine
I'll be anywhere at all

So make a difference
And remember what you said
The secret to any success is that the
Success is in the
Process

I turn up the radio a little louder
To drown out my own thoughts
What if I'd stuck it out a little longer?
Would I be happier now?
Would I be able to say
That despite what I feel now
That everything will be okay?

So make a difference
And remember what you said
The secret to any regret
Is not to let it affect you but don't ever forget.
So make a difference
And remember what you said.

Love isn't love 
Until you've got someone to share it with

Through you I've learned that love is on my side

I sit here and wonder why 
I can't get you off my mind 
A special scent 
And all you meant 
To me 

It's a love that just won't go away 
I hear it in the things you say 
I can't ignore (I can't ignore) 
I want you more and more, more and more and more 

Until you've got someone to share it with 
And I've got you

That I don't let nothing hold me back

And that ain't' my thang 
Cause I don't to stand with the crowd 
Only true to myself 
Don't have a follow to no one else 
Not trying to be alone 
But if the fact doing wrong 
Got no problem leaving the room 
Don't feel no sympathy 
At least not for me 
Cause I know just what I am going to do 
I gotta move

A little boy without a girl
You just smiled at me,
I knew I was on...
We spent weeks that were a blur
We made love so sweet and pure,
Then I knew, you were gone

Where is the man I've come to know?
With the heart I thought was gold
You just turned me out and walked out the door,
How could you just be so cold?
What a hard and heavy blow
Now I'm lying here, alone on the floor
Ooh

Are you in a better place?
Or behind another face?
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)

Are you just a mental case
or did you just begin 
Where are you now?

I've searched inside my soul
For the reasons never told
And what bothers me is they unknown
You should have told me from the start
Instead of playing with my heart
that you'd let me here with nothing to hold
So
I'm taking it easy, I cleared my head
I've cried me a river, said some prayers
But I often wonder, when I'm in my bed
Where are you now?

Are you in a better place?
Or behind another's face?
Where are you now?

It's a shame you have to learn the hard way
Now I have to take my love away
You see I could've made it easy
For you to become a part of me

You could've even say I'm sorry
For all the hurt and pain you caused me
Now I am supposed to give my deepest sympathy
You see I had enough of crying
And I'm tired of all the lyring
You see I refuse to let you take advantage of me baby

[Chorus]

Never took the time to think of
All the love that we have shared
I realized that most of the time
You were just not there
It was hard for me to see when
When your love was blinding me
But now I know I have to let you go your separate way

Things will never be the same
Cause baby, baby you did me wrong
Hurt so bad I can't move on

Got to learn the hard way

Brandy,"[Chorus]
Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I
Would  fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we
Would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By trying to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all of this crazy madness
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that
You an me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never say never

[Chorus]

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together

Brandy,"I had a dream, a crazy vision
It may sound strange, this intuition
But it was true beyond description
And somehow I knew that it was real
When I saw

One sky above, there is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart
One song, one voice

I've seen the fires of deep division
The hearts of stone, the cold ambition
But I have found my sacred mission
To live in this world and still believe
That there is

One sky above, there is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart
One song, one voice

A song that heals
A melody of reason and freedom
With words that will speak for the weak
The hopeful and the strong
Sing is for everyone

Cause there is one sky above
There is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart
One song, one voice

Yes there is only one sky above

If I got one chance, one choice

A love that will stand till the end of time

Your wants would be nothing
I put that on everything

I will pull a star out of the sky for you
Yes I would
To the edge of the earth
I'll go to see you
Yes it's true
If you're anywhere
And I'm not there
Just think one thought of love
And I'll appear

Before I dream
I lay and think of you every night
Honest to god
I'm telling you the truth
I wish you can see
How much your presence means to me
You would love me so much
More each day

I'll walk for you
Through the desert heat
I'll climb the mountains highest peak

I'd stay here by your side

So I'm leaving you goodbye
You turned away from opportunities
To sit and talk things through
But now when I say I'm leaving you
You have so much to prove

So long to all my pain

Goodbye sorrow
I won't cry no more
I'm leaving tomorrow

Stop writing me sweet letters and
Calling me on the phone
We argued constantly when i saw you
Always left me in the cold
I made the choice to finally go
Cause I can't stand this pain
It's time for my last tear to fall
And me to smile again

So long to all my pain

Goodbye sorrow
I won't cry no more
I'm leaving tomorrow

Sorrows and heartache goodbye
I'm leaving you

The sun will finally shine on me
And clouds will drift away
There's something that's in store in me
That's my brighter day

Good night to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow
I won't cry no more

I went from Helly Hanson to mini-mansions 
The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings 
Spent half of my advancing 
Jaws from branson 
I make it through my circumstances 
But u know I'm wiser now 
Move like kaiser now 
gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound 
gotta house in the valley 
Come and find me now 
Got enough dough to buy the town 
So I might give a 6 to my chick 
Benz to my mom 
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon 
Give a couch just to spill henny on
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton 

Some people say that I'm not the same girl 
They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems

Yes everything is quite the same

That my life's a fairy tale and 
Everything is so right 
I wish that you could know the truth 
My life is real so please don't get it twisted 
Problems the same and got to be dealt with 
These are the things I wish you knew 

Always in someone's eye so many questions why 
How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy

Don't understand why people 
Think I don't have friends 
Who knew me bad when 
This was my dream nothing has changed 
I still do the same things

I ain't sittin' on top I want a house on a lake 
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM 
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin 
I be with Puff the girls be like ""Who's his friend?"" 
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in 
So you gotta tell me right now 
Either your wit 
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips

But don't stop it 
Whats the use of buying a weight if I'm a hav to chop it 
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics 
She only mess with Mase know the money ain't an object 
If it ain't crissy he won't pop it 
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it

If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it

You've dreamed of all of your life
Just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

[Chorus]

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
What do I gotta say to get your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
Cause baby I can't sleep

It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad

Dark Child... 
Mase kid 
Harlem on the rise 
Come on, Come on , Come on , Come on, Come on 
I went from Helly Hanson to mini-mansions 
The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings 
Spent half of my advancing 
Jaws from Branson 
I make it through my circumstances 
But you know I'm wiser now 
Move like kaiser now 
gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound 
gotta house in the valley 
Come and find me now 
Got enough dough to buy the town 
So I might give a 6 to my chick 
Benz to my mom 
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon 
Give a ?cow? just to spill henny on 
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton 

Some people say that I'm not the same girl 
They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems 
Me like you I have to try and solve them 
Yes everything is quite the same 

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to be me 
Doing what I got to do 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin on top of the world 
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin' on top of the world 
I wonder why it's often said 
That my lifes a fairy tale and 
Everything is so right 
I wish that you could know the truth 
My life is real so please don't get it twisted 
Problems the same and got to be dealt with 
These are the things I wish you knew 
Always in someone's eye so many questions why 
How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy 

[CHORUS]

Don't understand why people 
Think I don't have friends 
Who knew me bad when 
This was my dream nothing has changed 
I still do the same things 

Yo,you can quit cookin short if it ain't about cake 
I ain't sittin on top I want a house on a lake 
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM 
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin 
I be with Puff the girls be like ""Who's his friend?"" 
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in 
So you gotta tell me right now 
Either your wit 
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips (Slow down Mase 
your killin me) 
But don't stop it 
what's the use of buying a weight if I'm a hav to chop it 
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics 
She only mess with Ma$e know the money ain't an object 
If it ain't crissy he won't pop it 
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it 
If it don't cost 60 he don't drop it 
If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it 
you can stop it , yea yea yea what what what?

'Cause they can only judge whatever they see
And I know what they'll say if they look at me
If I had all the answers to what they would ask
Still they wouldn't realize the love that we have
So now I have to deal with living secretly
'Cause for me love is worthless with no you and me

That is why I'm leaving you

You'll regret everything
You'll be looking for me
You never listen to me
You never really loved me
I've done everything I could
You did not meet me half way, why

You do not appreciate 
Anything I do, no

That is why I'm leaving you
Sorry cannot fix it
You'll regret everything
You'll be looking for me
You never listen to me
You never really loved me
I've done everything I could
You did not meet me half way, why

Well I tried and I tried
While you lied, I cried
So I'm saying goodbye
No more, no more

I say you soon as you came bouncing through the door
You and your mans and them just took over floor

Something tells me your the kinda guy I'd like to get to know

Used to spending money
I was just a girl
You couldn't buy me

Now I'm a woman, a true leading woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I'm a woman, a woman, a woman

I was just a girl
So soft spoken
I was just a girl
Mind wasn't open
I was just a girl
My work had me focused
I was just a girl
I was lonely in the showbiz

Now I'm a woman, a passionate woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I need someone who has something in common

I trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer man

We out",Who Is She 2 U,2004
Brandy,"I tried to stay up 'cause you're on your way up
For the weekend, said you wanna see me again
Said you'd be over, still ain't seen your Rover
Looking out my window it's a quarter to ten
It's about that time, I really can't stay hot

Know you wanna kick it and I was with it
But I won't be tripping if you don't show
Or hear you knocking
They got vacancy at the Howard Johnson
You know

Don't try to call me 'cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my two-way is lost
I had a Jones for ya but it seems you lost
I tried to wait for ya but I'm nodding off

I watched Forest Gump and put something on my stomach
I called my cousin, listened to her gossiping mouth
Touched up my makeup, anything to wake up
Trying to take up some time while I'm waiting it out

What's the hold up, thought you would've rolled up
In the driveway before the day gave
Why should I wait, I'm sleepy as hell
And there's no way I can abort this mission
So listen

Don't try to call me 'cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my two-way is lost
I had a Jones for ya but it seems you lost
I tried to wait for ya but I'm nodding off

No hard feelings
Really, I'm already under the cover
Please don't be mad at me
You gotta believe I still love ya

Don't try to call me 'cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my two-way is lost

Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you you're game was played, I licked it
Yo what if I said I wasn't true, so do you
You and I know, without me there's no you
So what about the bills that were passed due
Before you, all you said to me was ""Baby I'll owe you""

Go on and speak ya mind
I know somebody's lying
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in

Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see

The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just runnin' they mouth
So all we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin' what they heard
I can't give them no run
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough

All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind

How you listen to a girl who still want to man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wonderin' why she red to go like Wanda Van
When we met you was a V like manana man
Now you went field runnin' plays like Donovan
Knick nav before you get in a cab
I trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reeses Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around giggle said you so nuts
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
But how ya ex girl get that new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking by me I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious

There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind

Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing ain't never had nothing to me 
break me down to the floor til I hide the pain 
And to show you your girlfriend 
What you had me thinking you word was your bond 
(don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation 
you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for 
I can comprehend 

How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heat
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said wen you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here 
The times that I needed you 
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you 
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that chall go through 
I been here before 
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until its right at your door 
And then you just can't no more
Why does love feel this way
Why does it hurt so bad

Can't even look me in the face
Why does love hurt this way

How can you turn on me 
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart

Thought you said thought you said when you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go

The heartache and pain 
Sometimes it goes to your brain 
Sometimes it makes you insane 
Sometimes our joy is our pain
'cause it tears you apart these affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day that you come back to me girl
After we both go away its just to see if its real
There's no denying the fact its meant to be
If you let it go and then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept, 
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault 
And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking 
And most important I just question my self

The pain is taking over I can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll, me

I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I ain't eat in days, stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started 
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well its all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained 
I ain't thinkin' straight I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein' my old self 
Young wild uncontrolled self
I love you girl I don't need no one else

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart

When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside

Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, ooh ooh 

Lesson learned
House can burn 
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't go
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especially
I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible
My ice cream, have a lick
I catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need
Come be my number one, please?
See I ain't never blow no cheese
And done no songs like these
I love the air that you breathe
You know why? (Why-Why?)

Brandy,"We started off so good
We were honestly happy
You used to tell me, I was beautiful
Where did it all go wrong?
I can't believe
There's nothin' left for saving
How'd it go
From being in love to alone
It's like swimming on forever but it's moving us downstream
We can't win together we're no longer the same team
So you can watch my great escape tonight

Make me wonder
What's the use of all this?
What else can we call this

Passed the point of trying

No hello when u see me
You're on the phone talking to your boys
We don't even speak two words
I like a chose
To get a ""hey baby"" from you
I don't know, what happen to you and I
Wooooh
I don't want to be the one living with regrets
Thought about it finally I'm taking my deep breath

Where did it go?
There's no need for searching or rescue
No more, no more
It's so long for hope
It's wondedup for the shore
Baby, it's time that we both move on

Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

You see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good

You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine

I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry you seem to be confused)
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough

Made a pot of coffee extra strong
At the kitchen table sucking on a cigarette

While the dirty dinner dishes soaked
Woke up the kids and coaxed them out of bed

Then she burnt the toast just like the day before
The day she got divorced

Left the kids with the girl next door
Parked her car at the county court
Round and round 'bout the child support he'll never pay

Without the party of the second part
'Cause the party of the second part was MIA

Couldn't love him any less or hate him anymore
The day she got divorced

Wasn't working, had the whole day off
Bought a bottle then she called her boss
Waited for him at the motel lot til he got there

First he told her that her hair looked nice
Promised he was gonna leave his wife
Had two more lines but she didn't care

'Cause it was just like every other day before

Bored with her husband
Tired of the same old list of things to do
So when the to-dos have all been done
She sits down at the kitchen table
And rolls herself a fat one

Smoke so sweet fills the air
She maybe ought to crack a window
But all she can do is stare at the paint
That's been peeling off the walls
A couple tokes and her troubles don't seem all that tall

You know life will let you down
Love will leave you lonely
Sometimes to only way to get by
Is to get high

She laughs out loud at who she used to be
A girl who'd a looked down on
A woman's moking weed in her kitchen
Sometimes she misses those younger days
Seeing the world through rose colored glasses
Instead of this purple haze

You know life will let you down
Love will leave you lonely
Sometimes to only way to get by
Is to get high

He dropped out of college, he's in and out of jail
Had to pawn your pocket watch last month to post his bail
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to hell

And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the family you made
Mama's looking so much older, baby brother can't stay sober
I bet you're rolling over in your grave

Since you've gone to Heaven, they shut the sawmill down
Guys you worked for thirty years with have all moved out of town
There's signs in every store front, seems like everything's for sale
They say the market's bouncing back, but it's sure hard to tell
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to hell

And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the family you made
Mama's looking so much older, baby brother can't stay sober
I bet you're rolling over in your grave

Since you've gone to Heaven, I've struggled with goodbye
And broke a lot of promises I made the day you died
Wish I was more like you, less like myself
And I wish that I could talk to you 'cause I could use your help
Since you've gone to Heaven the whole world's gone to hell",Since You've Gone to Heaven,2016

In our own soap opera?

Sherry shampooed 'til she got her own chair
Now she's playing shrink to every head of hair
A mani or a pedi or color or a cut
Eight hours a day, it's the same old stuff
They got trouble with their ex and his next wife
Sands through the hourglass, days of our lives

Ain't we all the stars

Young and restless hearts
Duckin' and throwing darts

Jimmy wipes down the bar, makes a mean martini
They tip it on back and give him the skinny
Shaken or stirred or a bottle or a draft
They're baring their souls to the bottom of the glass
They got trouble with their girl and their girlfriend's mama
This one life to live got a whole lotta drama

Ain't we all the stars
Ain't we all the stars
Playing the leading part
In a daytime drama?
Young and restless hearts
Duckin' and throwing darts
Yeah, we're all big stars
In our own soap opera
Yeah, yeah

This town might be little bitty
But just ask Sherry or Jimmy
