Moxy Früvous,"Bell tower 
At the station
Is ringin' the morning out.
Imprisoned by

The situation.
Would be every bit as sour
If I miss you half as much.
Miss you half as much.

The man at the track
Sent all the passengers back
And said the 3:29 wouldn't come.
No locomotion just ?devotion?.

I folded the map into the book on my lap
And wondered if I would feel half as numb 
If I miss you half as much.
Miss you half as much.

In a year or two
We'll see this distance and this heartache through.
I never realized 
That I would need the joys and secrets of your eyes
That much.

Bells chime
In the hallway.
You better believe that I
Be only loving you for always.

'Cause there'll never be a time
I could love you half as much.
Love you half as much.
Love you half as much.",Half as Much,1999
Moxy Früvous,"Sad girl,
Taking every cue from every ad, girl.
Hopelessness is easy when it's a fad, girl.
And being good is only when you're a bad girl.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this mad world.
Sad girl,
Showing there is nothing you want to be.
Rejecting anyone who loves you truly.
And holding that expression like it's a duty.
Sad girl,
What is it that makes you such a beauty?
Once in a while, to hold your head high
Would leave you a sell out.
Resigned to ask why, devoted to die,
When everything that you've been told,
By any person that you hold,
When any happiness and love will
Give you every reason to lie.
Sad girl,
Taking every cure from every ad, girl.
Depression is romantic when it's a fad, girl.
And being good in only when you're a bad girl.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this mad world.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this man's world.
Sad girl.",Sad Girl,1999
Moxy Früvous,"Folks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher,
She was a red hot hoochie coocher,
She was the roughest, toughest frail,
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

and he showed her how to kick the gong around.

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
a diamond car with the platinum wheel.

Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey
Hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses,
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

Moya Brennan,"A wall strong in numbers
Burns the midnight candle

Moya Brennan,"You came here from a distant shore
By your side a friend and an open smile
Coming over the mountains
on the winding road
You sit at my table
As your stories unfold

Here is my home now
Looking out at the sea
Always wanted to be there
On Atlantic shore

How can we listen to your heart
When we cannot hear and understand ourselves
With a soul full of music
Still refusing to dance
But you knew all the old songs
You're a stranger no more

Here is my home now

Open your heart
Let it fall into place

The angry man is dreaming
Can he do more
Remembering tears
Memories linger
Your eyes are full of secrets
Can we see deep within
Can we see those dreams

Never lose the faith
From your faded heart
Never lose desire
To drift away
To break the chains

High emotions
Long long road feels empty
Lonely highways
Tormenting my fears
The wind blows
Wherever it pleases
Will we see deep within
Can we see those dreams

Sun will keep on rising
Reasons given
On reaching for hope
Carry moments
No longer for lamenting
I believe deep within
You will see those dreams",I Believe (Deep Within),1992

Hold on take heart and discover all the world

Could it be the waves on the rocks
Could it be the patter of the rain
Could it be the sigh of the breeze

Could it be the thrill of our love

Dream on of a love that's ours together
Hold on take heart and discover all the world

Would I have a reason to stay
Would I have to look far away
To find you
Would I have to dream on today

We did I feel left behin
Why did I think that I'll never fall

He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till he returns or calls me home

Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding dong, ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling

One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air

Oh, how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er Hill and Dale
Telling their tale

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer

On without end

A lifestyle like no other how you want it
When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into
And pray to whoever you praise that you live through
Living for the light 'til the light becomes a signal
And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to
Then it turns round like the signals on the dial
And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals
Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate
Looking for a dimmer, get to cooking all winter
And you looking more blizzard and this turns into a bar raid
Aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised
Check day jumping, chest plate thumping

Gotta have it, its already mine
Its already ours, its already ours

The smell of Rosé and a nickel plated glare
The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare
Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears
Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there
There like a cling on, fear like the ring on
That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on
Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there
Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug
And it u­turns to a pillow case and a rug
And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged
And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst
The doors shut and they forget to let you out first
The trap literally jumping and you stuck in
Being everything you saw when you wanted even more
And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all
For the civilized leisure

They say sky your story don't ever change up
It never will, it's everything that I say it was
Forever will be centered on how we came up
On tryna be in the center of where the cake be
They told us keep it the same and if the cake leave
Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe
May whoever's beside me have the same speed

Cause you bleed red and so do I
Who's to say that you're wrong or to say that I'm right

And was I just killing time
Was I just filling space
Sitting on a land mine
Sipping drinks that were laced
I don't think that there's anything I can't do
But like a loaded gun in the hands of a child
Or a man on the run
Something's bound to happen

Ooh Lord and, all the days get so long I don't think I will make and
Ooh Lord and, all the days turned to darkness sadness can't shake it

Now I just can't stay quiet and you wonder why it don't pay to feed and not be fed

I was told to stand in line
By someone long ago that explained me my life
I'm a mold and I know it's a crime
That I followed the leader to dark and not light

And who was making these rules that we follow like sheep
And who's bending these rules just to format their needs
I'm faced with falsehood everyday
It's hard to tell who's real it's hard to tell who's fake

Sometimes I move to slow,

Sometimes I talk to loud, 
But you got to hear me out, 
You never need to doubt, 
I've never been so fragile, 
Now that's all I'm all about. 

(Say you wont) Stay away. 
(Say you will) Trust me. 

I didn't see it coming, 
I've been so used to running, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Never known before... 

So hard to say the things that want to, but I will, 
I feel so open wide that it's pathetic, 
It's silly to believe something are meant to be, 
But nothing will ever be if we don't let it. 

(Say you will) See me back that way. 
(Say you wont) Lose your faith. 

I didn't see it coming, 
I've been so used to running, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

I grew up on my own, 
Spent so much time alone, 
That it's taken me awhile, 
To let somebody in, 
Show them where I've been, 
And so whoa. 

You know I want you near me, 
My dreams are vivid and I,

So why don't you come home?
So we can talk about the things
That I did wrong again

The games you play

But I can't cry anymore
So what's this for?
If you wanna leave, leave

Would lay down here and die to make to smile

Desviaram seu destino

Tem dias que a gente se sente
Como quem partiu ou morreu
A gente estancou de repente
Ou foi o mundo então que cresceu
A gente quer ter voz ativa
No nosso destino mandar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega o destino pra lá
Roda mundo, roda-gigante
Roda moinho, roda pião
O tempo rodou num instante
Nas voltas do meu coração
A gente vai contra a corrente
Até não poder resistir
Na volta do barco é que sente
O quanto deixou de cumprir
Faz tempo que a gente cultiva
A mais linda roseira que há
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a roseira pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
A roda da saia, a mulata
Não quer mais rodar, não senhor
Não posso fazer serenata
A roda de samba acabou
A gente toma a iniciativa
Viola na rua, a cantar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a viola pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
O samba, a viola, a roseira
Um dia a fogueira queimou
Foi tudo ilusão passageira
Que a brisa primeira levou
No peito a saudade cativa
Faz força pro tempo parar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a saudade pra lá

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

And for a long time I think niggaz been taking So So Def for a joke
But I guess that's why we rich and y'all niggaz is broke

Y'all got one chance to flow I let y'all know
While y'all stretch your mouth I stretch my dough

You want to get uh, oh here he is now
Dot to the O caughted blow your shit down
Dot to the see you're feelin' me now?
Anyhow y'all niggaz can't measure up
I'm here to get my cheddar and who ever mess it up?
Then I'mma blow these rounds out, wet â??em up
For my dawgs like DMX who pound like Kurupt
And Snoopy in the club getting at the groupies
Stash the uzi tonight flash the jewelry
And just post up we can't be touched
All my niggaz say, ""WHAT WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK""! (UH)

Spittin' Crips for chips, plant bombs in your whip
I bring the pain to the game on the real tip what?
Hittin' niggaz like JFK
For the pounds and the bricks and yay, hear what I say?
Squeezing off, just to mash and releasing off
Y'all motherfuckers shouldn't be so soft
Oh you type thug niggaz
Frump niggaz, yo I got no love niggaz
Expect the worse yo check it can make you see the hearse
Tell mama I'm about to break the button for the nurse
Niggaz don't want it but they think they do
And soldiers should never fuck with me and my crew, who?

You know I'm gonna make them dance when I step in the club

Well I know another way to make â??em put their hands up

I drop the beat on
I cock the heat on
I got this party niggaz
We lock the street corners

Well it's him again, the Timbaland lacer
You trembling in the faces, Detroit hates us
Take us, come smooth the hard shit, rock jewelry
Like Mr. Antarctic
Watch our hands move regardless of the chartless
Cock your automatic
So the safest thing for you to do is shut the fuck up
Let my crew do this (UH) like this niggaz from the bricks and (UH)

Now we make murder cases out of sleepers

O to the D to the E F-uck you 'cause we buck you,
Y'all niggaz can't touch us

Assume my position 'cause papermaking's a must
Straight mangle motherfuckers when it's time to bust
Lace flows with angel dust all up in your spot
We got no things with us, kind of dangerous
Don't fuck around and get caught in a verbal onslaught
'Cause I'm label your bills and my man Too $hort , ooh Lord
Getting down one more time
For making motherfuckers who be out on the run
I gotta get mine daily can't let these motherfuckers fade me
That's just the way my mama made me
Top size rider from the get go, known to spit flows
And keep them niggaz on their tiptoes
I goes to the extremity blind with weed and hennesy
I know you niggaz don't remember me
Got the flow poetic, and I stay diamond setted
Running over tracks like I'm Libyan, here's the past
Labeled a pussy, cash see her bounce
Shaking, moving, waiting, sipping the ounce
What's up with that? None of y'all niggaz can fuck with Black
Motherfucker where's your focus at?
JD my mellow my ace get on the mic and come rock please

Nigga I feel like why you gon come if ain't on time
And ain't no need in coming out if you ain't gonna shine
That's why I am why I am with mine and y'all sick
While y'all keep it real we keep it rich
Just clowning, pounding, riding around in
Some of the most elite shit to ever hit the town
Screaming out how you like me now and I'm gettin busier
I stay platinum while y'all get dizzier
The difference between y'all is I get 'em out of their seats

Mr Twin Sister,"I slipped up, felt the echo of a memory
rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I've had two or three,
I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head

(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone
I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I've had three or four,
I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs
of the world around me I’m in the mood,
to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if
I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro,
my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls
I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world
let the truth surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

Mr. 3-2,"Listen up I got a story to tell
Ay fool, listen up I got a story to tell
Say dog, listen up I got a story to tell
Say man, listen up I got this story to tell

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
Now this was not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, tryna push me
He used to hold dick now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but not a punk in the parking lot bumping his gums
With his Ki's in the trunk, oh what I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky you chump
Point that motherfucker this way and dump
Oh what you scared to go to the pen?
Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap your rump?
Man I thought he played bold but he ain't even fuss
Man the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to buss
But his trigger stayed cold I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise a sheep in wolf's clothing
On the prey, who tried to hunt the hunter
And got hunted down his goddamn self in PA
Niggas it's where we stay
Ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin' so see A
Or E about your life 'fore you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off some peace to rest yourself
Oh yes your health is what's in question
And I hope that this ass whippin'
Teach you a motherfuckin' lesson

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down on my name and what it's all about
You niggas better be gettin' some cut and get my name out yo mouth
'Cause I dunno why you got flex with me
Testin' me but I'mma pull my shit and let you see
That all that carry the jack ain't able to survive
So you haters need to quit with that po' hustlin'
And take another ride

Niggas jumped and crossed the line
The movies got these boys fucked up in the mind
Not to mention the wine and codeine syrup combined
Easy access to 9s
And shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is pourin' Swishers down
Committing crimes amped off water
And some exaggerated rhyme
So if bein' hard ain't in your heart
Then don't start niggas'll tear your weak mind apart

Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school
He don't know I hang with killers we'll erase that fool
Wouldn't give a fuck about him but he kin to my son
If you think that I'm that nigga then you picked the wrong one
'Cause I live by the gun, die by the gun
Hot bullets burn some say that them bitches stun
So raise your own children don't try to raise mine
And when you see me step with caution 'cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You done crossed the line now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before but you ain't barring that
So this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map
Such a shame but it's all in the game
And since the early 60's ain't a damn thing changed
We got haters over here and haters over there
But I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo bitch done chose a pimp and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked your girl
Put big dick in her world, bust nuts in her curls
When I hit it from the back she said ""baby I can't take it""
Push my dick up in her harder bitch I'm straight up tryin' to break it
You a simp-ass nigga you told that bitch that you love her
But I'm straight up fuckin' that pussy like that nigga off they colors
But I ain't gonna get shot 'cause you ain't shootin' shit
The best thing you can do is go and try and beat that bitch
'Cause this man's style showstopper pistol popper you ain't ready
If I let this hot thing hit you fool, your stomach like spaghetti
Fool you talkin' loud but you move too slow
Tellin' niggas all your plans got you tied up in a van
Nigga what the fuck is up (up) in the place to be
First I want the money nigga then I want the fuckin' Ki's
Kidnap robbery 'cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigga dead
Buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40 nigga I be comin' fed
Got the sawed off pump with night vision infrared
So play me like a pussy and you will get fucked
Nigga I'm hangin' out the truck b-buck buck
Hit your nigga in the leg hit your bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay
So your ass will get touched

Speak the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched cause yo ass deserve
To get done real bad in front of yo kids
To show 'em what real type of bitch you is
And it's that boy named 3 to the 2 forever stayin' true
Just a player makin' do and I gotta tell it to the
Whole wide world how you got bitched razor necked just like

(Bun B) 

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin 

had to find my place 

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue 

had to dodge a case 

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real 



(Chorus) 

I feel no pain 

I can't complain 

Stuck in the game 

Tryin to maintain 

Cause I'm so real 



(Pimp C) 

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win 

Out here just hustlin and grindin 

Tryin to change from niggas to men 



Chorus 



(3-2) 

My nigga you a ho to me 

Boy you done went off on me 

Runnin round with the fakin and hatin 

I'ma blast if you run up on me 

I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch 

This matter coulda been resolved 

if you woulda came clean and paid my shit 

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last 

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass 

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up 

No respect for your family that's dead 

don't write yo peoples locked up 

Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game 

Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name 

You boys is funny 

I'm bout my money 

And oh so true

I'm too real

Heat with hollow clips, ready to bust shots
Glocks, full of heat leaving the situation hot
Plot all day boss hogging for position
Street game all in your face watch the rolex cushion
Heavy weightier, I'm the champ, Mr. 3-2
Really though big baby and it's 2002
Wreck a shop with Mo-Yo I'm boy hard
Boys, want to got to war black them out like tar
Swingers, on my guard, in a old school
I'm a god damn fool, start to busting with the two
Fresh braided, player made it, deuce out the roof
Rest in peace to my old and in these streets running loose
Ain't no use, trying to stop it just come and pop it
Loco, big dozer and we still sitting sloppy

Watch her get a china face lift
Gear shift, we performing up in the land
Suicide doors, dubs and twin cams
All bitches on the fam' heads turning tonight
Watch us be the star traction and a harder night
More than Sprite, plus my neck and wrist are cold
Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze
These hoes, all on a nigga dick cause I'm young, fly and rich
Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job
R.I.P. to Pab aka Mr. Sweets
If you peeping from the south we about to blow you fin to see
Gucci boots on her feet, Gucci boots on my feet
I'ma pay a lot tonight, shine and have a seat

I got a box of doughnuts from Crispy Creme
Everybody looking at me like Flip you the shit
Hell yeah I'm the shit, look at my wrists
I roll up a Philly, roll up a Philly
Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that
It's Lil' Flip I'm a million dollar star
Blue, black or red don't touch my car, uh

I'm shook up, I'm looking throwed
Gucci wardrobe to match the Gucci soles
Gucci hoes and hop out the SL
I'm popped up and sliding on Sprewell
We sell, everything you need
Riding through with Pardon Davis and some falling t.v.s
Moe and me, we have been a lot
Looking for some head in a little bitty shop
On top, on wrist rock it's going down

Pulled up acting and class so they'll know
The south on shine cause we ain't broke no more

Cause you know that's hot, and them haters
Do your thang and come on home, cause you know
That I'm waiting, with that fire

5 in the morning, ain't no yawning ain't no time for sleeping
I'm still working the block, the block still bleeding
I'm still toting a glock, cause niggaz be scheming
I still want what you got, until then I ain't leaving
Battle scarred and hard headed, off of the streets
Was brought up in the hustle, the game supported me
Day to day grinding, gotta make sure we eat
Gotta make sure, we can step out on the block and be seen
Trying to let all them fiends know, I'm back on the scene
Got them power packs ready, Scottie throw down a beam

Baby girl home alone, waiting for me to show up
Plus this morning, she told me she woke up throwing up
And I wanna lay, all I'm thinking bout is paper
It might be real early, in the morning when I come home
But best believe I'm coming home, pockets full of do'


Gonna hop up on niggaz, like quizzes in class
Sensei shife niggaz, and chizzle they masks
I ain't your hammer jamming, but I'm packing a glass
When I hit you I'ma split you, like that crack in your ass
Got elbows of weed, I'm bagging my grass
I got weight niggaz, think I need to take out the trash
4 flipping in the dash, one under the seat
Worm just laid the track, to what I done to the beat
Wet niggaz up everywhere, but under the feet
Plus I rock-a-bye niggaz, put 'em under a sheet
I'm trying to get freaky tonight, I'm in the mood
For a baby-faced girl, with a big girl mule
Jeans on the couch, underwear in the pool
Closer boys keep girls, square in the nude
A layer, the Earth's my turf so I'm a grown
When I'm finished with these streets, I'm gone into hiding

Pull it all night, as on the block stacking bread
Ducking police, and I'm stacking big heads
Never letting it go FED, while I grind it out
Shooting dice on my knees, making boys drop out
Got it popped at the spot, and a twat that's wide
I dig up between thighs, when they qualified
Naked showing hide, cotton up six figgas
Day for day on the block, watching thangs get bigger
Build an empire, the boss of the street game
Stack it up real pretty, I'm sicking all my change
Fame is a trip, people can back stab you
Gotta watch your back, cause somebody could grab you
Stay on no cases, and counting the big faces
They'll be working for your vote, in all kinda places
The glock stay crunk, and lit up at all times
But it make it heavy, that's why I'm getting mine",Fire,2004

See I was born, all by myself
If it wasn't for the worst, I wonder who would be left
Who really gonna hold me down
When all the chips, finally hit the ground
I had to stop, and look around
At all these new friends, I just found
Cause when I started out, singing these songs
It was me, Screw and a microphone
Slanging grey tapes, on Gravestone
All night long, sipping pints to the dome
Now I'm making hits, getting ghetto bitch
Now all these hoe ass niggaz, be up on my dick

That the whole world is in disguise
And all the pain that's in my eyes
Came with the fame, and all the lies

But Big Moe, still got deals
Fuck Beverly Hills, I'm still Southsive
From the cradle, to the grave
To the end of my days
I'm still gon get pay-ayed

Hollin' what it do, claiming that you true

You nothing ass fools, better get from round here
All up in my ear, I'm trying to holla at this broad
But you riding my pitbull, like menage tois
Running up on my car, wanting a contract
I ain't looking for no acts, but you bout to get slapped
To a coma, gone on a, get to stepping
Down the yellow brick road, 'fore I pull out my weapon
I done told you once, won't tell you twice
Move around playboy, shake and roll like dice
All that grabs handshakes, all that's fine
But it's a place for everything, and partna it's about time

I had to run farther away from the throne one accepts upon stardom
Lose ya self there, whether you believe it or don't
Spendin' nights breathin' in smoke, whether cheeba or dope
Then hot break it down to litres of coke
Walk through the crowd wid all intentions I'm leavin' wid hoes
Seems like a nice way of livin', the stressful have
Cause all them jealous cats, ready to test your ass
Let's not take it there, I remain cool
Learnt how to handle them situations in grade school

From New York to London, when crews talk amongst us
it's nothin' but good things
Not only the bad stuff is what the hood brings
Listen, cats is salivatin' plottin' on eatin' ya meal
The four fives carried in our dome keep it concealed
Runnin' laps around tracks 'til we bleed from our heels

Is that the telephone ringing?
The curtains can't hold back the light

Down in her heart

In a sixties movie
Maybe tell the press you died
Little legend baby
Try your very best to hide

She keeps some memories locked away
But they are always escaping
neclgect won't make them fade away
They're reaching into her dreams
Down in her heart
Don't need fingers to be tearing it apart


Gotta face the day
There is no other way
To clear the fog inside your mind
Fill it up with dreams

I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around

I got to let it go, no one will ever know

I got a little to loose in Oklahoma city
I didn't care if she was young
Didn't care if she was pretty

I got a little too loose

Keep little secrets far too long
Guess that I'll put them in a song

Didn't care if she was pretty

Someone's yesteryear dreams
That's my kinda woman
I could tear down the silver screen

A fallen woman femme fatale
Her body screamed heartbreak
Hotel... brains and beauty
Break down the walls, I fall
Down, to my knees,
When I see her picture in the movie magazines
All heads turned ooh for the lady in red
Bring up the house light and say

My kinda woman
Bring back those yesteryear dreams
My kinda woman help me
Tear down the silver screen

Picture perfect 
X marks the spot
There's just no way
To tell you how hot

To the right place eye to eye

Mr. Big,"Staring back from inside my mirror
A boy I used to know
Shining eyes that see right through my window soul
Cowboys, kings and flying aces
Somehow saved the day
We were stealing kisses from the princess in the palace
My Alice through the looking glass
Is there really anything that lasts
Makes me wonder if time is a bullet
'Cause everything is happening too fast

(chorus)
I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
And let them fall
Where are they now
All the people that I've known
That turned out to be me
Where are they now

Waiting in a line of five o'clock shadows
Another pencil in the drawer
Tripping over echoes in my head
Wishing I was someone else instead
Makes me wonder if time is my hero
And everything will come around again

(chorus)

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
And let them fall

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The ones I touched
And let them fall

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
And let them fall

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
All the people that I've known
That turned out to be me

Look an arrow through the heart

When silence played the king of pain

And contemplate a change

Ooh they got us fucked up
They forgot about us
Ooh they got us fucked up

I went to jail cause they say that I be selling that yae
They hate to see a young black nigga trying to get paid
Get on the phone, call my mama and my lawyer
And tell all them hoes, I'm fuckin send me some money order
Cause I'm gonna be hear a while, ain't getting out
I should've never brought my black ass to the south,
I can't make bail cause I ain't got no bonds
They ain't gonna give me no bonds cause they know I'm gonna run
These white bitches will make nigga ass feel it
They got me fucked up, so now I gotta deal wit it
They want to make a deal, bitch I ain't no fuckin squealer
They say I'm a kingpin and a fire arm dealer
The kingpin is the white boy that locked me up
He got the whole fuckin neighborhood sowed up
Take twenty years for some shit you can't prove
Just because I'm black, you think that I'm a damn fool
No dope, no guns, no case, let's take this shit to trial
Mr. Bigg versus the state, and then I still might not win
Because I know they want to send me to the pen

I'm riding on the muthafuckin van
With two handcuffs on my muthafuckin hands
I'm on my way to court, trying to see what they going to give me
My homies in the court room holler if ya hear me
My bitches on the back row, crying and shit
This muthafuckin judge trying to offer me a ten split
I ain't taking shit, cause you ain't got no evidence
Tell the grand jury they can suck my muthafuckin
Riding on the muthafuckin bus
On my way to prison, but I don't give a fuck
They shaved my face, and cut the hair up off my head
And gave me a blanket and a sheet for a muthafuckin bunk bed
Three t-shirts and three pairs of socks
A bar stain soap, toothpaste, and a padlock
I'm settled in now it's time for me to creep
I finally meet some niggas, that I knew from when I was on the street
Mr. Bigg how much time you got?
I heard you had twenty years and you ain't never getting out
Telling me I need Jesus, muthafuckas get locked up
Now they want to be preachers,
I can't pray cause I don't know how
I wasn't saved on the streets
So who can fuckin save me now
But when I hit the streets again
I won't forget about my homies in the pen

Over by the softball field
Chumps telling lies about the niggas they done killed
And all of the keys that they flew from overseas
And all of the weed that they grew in Tennessee
Lying about there homes and they testerosed kits,
But those same hoes, haven't never sent you shit
I reminisce late at night laying in my bed
Thinking about the shit my mama once said
Never trust a nigga and never trust a woman
And never fuck a bitch unless you getting something from her
A lot of niggas bawl because they give them hoes their heart
The same niggas I see crying in the dark

Stop sn****

Police say they'll let me go if I gave up on my dawg
Don't try to observe the truth, I don't break no ghetto laws
I don't put pressure mane on others to ease pain
Or brothers put in chains, help mothers to go insane

Project Pat'll never rat, even though I'm lovin' cheese
Picked it up, one more gat, some broke down to their knees
Told about murders and plots, talked about **** and glocks
Helped out on kidnappings, assisted on robbery spots

Me I kept my mouth shut, ears eyes open wide
I done witnessed lunch money took down to homicides
Project ain't a baby to this game, I's a grown mane
Birds fly mainly on a plane even in the rain

Let's get it, hold the hell on, what the **** is goin' on
These **** tattle tattlin' like they **** ain't wrong
God damn who ever started singing like a song
**** you's a bitch mine as well wear a thong

Got caught with some yams and a scale, scale, scale
Now this snitchin' *** **** wanna tell, tell, tell
I see the hate in your eyes, and it's not a surprise
You can quit actin' ****, I see through your disguise

They hated on Jeezy you think I give a ****
I'm still tryin' to hit the lottery and cop a bigger truck
Sometimes I wonder how I even made it this far
I'm a lucky young **** I ain't no**** rap star

I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell

I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell

Stop sn****

You went to jail same charge like my **** here
He got a 20 ball, I heard that you got a year
I never fear just stay up out you **** ways
You boys hot and you got these streets in a blaze

They play cool jealousy lyin' dormant
Feds got a secret weapon called an informant
Logic of a snitch, he ain't know but I'ma let you in
Why would I do 10, when I can go on and turn in my friend

Not pokin' fun, Project Pat is only spittin' facts
Now-a-days gotta watch the **** who watchin' ya back
Manes these **** heart colder then a dead body
They'll set they own momma up, you ain't nobody

I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell
I done seen **** folks tell, tell, tell

**** are consiprin' to take you down, take you down, why?
Hustlers, pay attention to your environment
**** are conspirin' to take your crown, take your crown, why?

Mr. Biggs,"In the fog lights
There was tear gas floating through the twilight
And he wondered what life would be like
With a giant screen TV, a fridge full of beer
And a conscience that's clean

See lately
She'd been thinking about her little tiny baby
And the boy who had gone to defend me
She's a good friend of mine
But I can't take the place of her man anytime

And it won't be long till he's coming home

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
Gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

Now meanwhile
He was reading magazines on the front line
He was trying not to think about her life
And what he might have done
'Cause it seemed like neither one of them
Were having any fun

See lately
She'd been acting kinda crazy lately
Oh man, I thought she was gonna hate me
'Cause I couldn't watch her little one
I had so much to do, I was so high strung

And it won't be long till daddy's home

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
You gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

And lately, all the hate escapes me
And lately all the hate just escapes me lately

So he phoned her
He said, ""Darling, I've been feeling so alone here
Am I making myself perfectly clear
And I'm on my way back just a couple more missions
And I start getting packed""

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
Gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

Lately I was wondering if she heard from him lately
Oh, lately I was wondering if she heard from him lately",Lately,2000
Mr. Biggs,"Lookin' for these better days
Better days, heyy! Better days
Got me thinkin' bout better days
Better days! Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' bout better days

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
Wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Pa**ed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days, hey!
Better days, got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
That in my future years, I'd be stressin'
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' pa**ionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin'
Lookin for them better days

(Lookin' for better)
Better days, better days hey!
Better days (Oh better days) 
Thinkin' bout better days (I'm lookin for better)
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days (Better days)
Got me thinkin bout better days (Oh)

Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days

(Lookin' for better)
Better days, better days, hey!
(Better days) Thinkin' bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days

I send this one out, 
To all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, 
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, 
Downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin' homeboy, keep your head up

Mr. Billy,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean

But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Good-Bye,2002

You know the ones you wanna make your wife, ya heard me?

Little fast bitch, actin' sarcastic
Need to get her ass kicked, tryin' to get the cash quick
She be my last pick, I got a real hoe
Take yo' ass back to class and buy a dildo
Don't let the freak in you  keep you up all night
Gettin' fucked and sucked, you wastin' your life
Before a real nigga ever kick a hoe down
She gotta understand what I know now
Ain't no broke down, lazy, gold digging, cute bitch
Come around me gettin' credit cards and don't do shit, bitch
I travel throughout the year
I keep a woman with a house and her own career
So when I buy her a diamond ring, it's just a gift (what's your name?)
Too Short baby, don't need to trick
I give her what she want cause I'm a real player
Platinum after platinum, ask me how I feel later

See I ilke them crazy hoe
Them straight, get down and pay me hoe
I wouldn't mind no jazzy hoe
Make my creep fall right out my clothes
On the blow, can't let no hoe see my flow
Tight jean and bra strap, girl that got to go (gotta go)
Strip you on down like a shake-a-booty hoe (uh huh)
Put you in the street, make me mo' money mo'

Now see, just the other night, I met me a ol' jazzy hoe
Straight boozyabitch, ol' sassy hoe
Who think she fly to death, so I ain't gon' hold my breath
To let you skeezers know, just let you ask yo'self
For as I cut one but two down the line
But could it be yo' hoe that I'm cuttin' everytime?
And I come to find she servin' every nigga in yo' clique
To get in where she fit in, now she known to be a trick

Quote for quote, who tote like this
Hit the Club Jig, on some Wes Snipe shit
Snatchin' all the hoes in your harem, indeed
I mock turtlenecks while I'm bees and tweed
Til I proceed, damn right, the spot's tight
Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)
But that's cool though, cause I know how to stain golds
I pimp tight without the kangol, niggas know
I slang flow, east to west
Available at anytime to put the pussy to the test

Shy, not I, some times I choose not to speak
Surrounded by my real niggas drinkin' Hennessee
Or Remy or Red Passion with champagne
Chiefin' up some hay, gettin' at them hoes, man
Trick, not I, trick be you, can you dig that?
I got star hoes pickin' me up in Tahoes
Fuck them at-the-bar hoes, tryin'-to-score hoes
Mickey dropin' hoes, quick to drop they clothes
I give those only funky weave wearin' bitches
All made up, gettin' at a  niggas riches
I like women with they head on straight
Pull your own weight and you can fuck wit' Eight

Mr. Bungle,"A carnival for the human race 
Cotton candy, happy face 
A child talking with his mouth full 
Girlfriend gets stuffed animal 

A festive mood is all around 
Another world is what we've found 
Step right up, let's make a deal 
Let's ride on the ferris wheel 

You know there's something lurking underneath the shape 
With a mask over it's head and makeup on his face 
Into the house of mirrors goes a clown and his elf 
Take a look in the mirror and see the clown in yourself 

If you want to know what's behind the show 
You ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell 
Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held 
Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. 

The clown that painted a smile on you 
Is now the one unmasking you 
Animated scenes unwind 
Dormant figures come to life 

Entangled in your own web 
A twisted tunnel overhead 
A glimpse of light, a drop of dew 
You slide into the swimming pool 
A roller coaster ride into the rivers of your mind 
The currents merge, your feelings surge, your life's a pantomime 
Beauty is the spiral going round & round the beast 
Without the vampire effect the carnival is deceased 

Fun.

Mr. Bungle,"As the congregation grows
To my ears the greatest sin
The lung of solitude deflates
Feel a bit like Beethoven

Exiled to the inner voice, difference is
Simultaneous they speak unbeknownst
He had no choice

We can't seem to find the air
To get our message through your heads
Poor respiration is sure
To keep clear communication obscure
As if I should care

As if you are listening out there

The louder you speak the more I can hear
The less I can understand
Pound on it, pound it in
To my ears the greatest sin
Feel a bit like Beethoven
Paint my lungs so silently

The darkest color of your noise
A crowd will contradict its own audibility
Can't hear the dialogue for the voice

No one is listening
Ears are ringing
Yet ears are ringing

In the morning I will see
What you were trying to say to me
As I respond into the sink
Need not again hear myself think
Ears are ringing


Wax within my ears has grown
Just like the snot inside my nose
My interpretation of distorted conversation

I will kill for isolation
To enjoy the breath of silence
When the blood comes naturally
Sacrifice the energy

Before the threshold of pain has grown
I have chosen to plug my nose
Mole out from society
Survive off my soliloquy

Bleeding from nose, throat & ears
Removed I can speak as he has",Slowly Growing Deaf,1991
Mr. Bungle,"Inside of me today A waste There is no one Only asteroids and empty space ...They're looking through the windows at me... Get me out of this air-conditioned nightmare Rots your brain just like a catchy tune You will hate life more than life hates you ...Burn all your mementos of me... Walkin' on air Up from the wheelchair I'll find the suicide That I deserve Walkin' on sand But it's so comfortable Forgotten where I am Here in the sun... I only see rainbows Now that the bandages are gone From the skyscrapers Through my window, there Down to the submarines Sanctuaries Birds and fairies Atop the rolling hills of hell These words are sledgehammers That pound the iron heart Of truth Of sin Vandalizing My wet dream is drying up... Bloody smiling Where's my rainbow? Where's my halo? There's my halo!

Mend my shipwrecked spirit

In the black iron prison of St. Augustine's light
He's paying the bills and they're doing him proud
They can float their burnt offerings on assembler clouds

The new Franklins fly their kites
With omega point in the sight
And the post modern empire is ended tonight

From history
The flood of counterfeits released
The black cloud
Reductionism and the beast
Automatons gather all the pieces
So the world may be increased
In simulation jubilation

For the deceased...
Spray-on clothes and diamond jaws
Wrinkles smoothed by nanoclaws

With my machines I can dispatch you
From this world without a trace
Our nostalgia ghosts are ready to take your place

Content-shifting shopping malls
Gasoline trees and walk-through walls

None of them knew...

As I watch the dead rise up out of the earth
I feel the gray goo boiling my blood

Try to hide from the lies as they all come true
Deus absconditus
Deus nullus deus nisi deus

I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As the fenris wolf slowly bites through his chain
Try to hide the myth as it becomes a man

None of them knew they were robots

Buying an X or an O
Cats game for Joe Blow
In state craft tic tac toe

A binary hug or kiss
Post industrial bliss
Can be wrung from utility mist

They stole the great arcanum
The secret fire
Moloch found his gold
For the new empire
Once again
The necrophage becomes saint

Lindy hop around the truth
Jump back wolf pack attack
Swingin' up there in the noose
Jump back wolf pack attack
Slap back white shark attack
Slap back white shark attack
Phased array diffraction nets

From full-wall paint-on TV sets
Migratory home sublets
And time shared diamond fiber sets

Recombinant logos keys

Bitic Qabalistic trees
I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As leviathan and his bugs freeze the sea

Try to save the world by immolating myself
The flood of counterfeits released
From history
The black cloud
Automotons gather all the pieces
The resurrection of the deceased
In simulation jubilation
For the builders
So the world may be increased

Man ese aqui paso, soy Capone

Make all you fuckin putos bounce to this
Catch this rolla and grab your pistola

Ride, ride from side to side
Southside Pride mashing all fucking night
Another crazy ass g that's born to roll
Sittin on chrome looking for some hoes

Countin us some hundreds in a burned out blosses
Stoppin see some socas in a Blazer
Remember them putos son player haters
And you know I can't be faded leva
Ain't nothin fun I'm jacking money so keep trucha
And open your ears and your beers to the one and only assassin
Laughin to the hynas that keep mackin
So ask yourself ""Whose the motherfuckin pimp""
In other words whose the motherfuckin shit
The sly, the slick, the one outstanding a.k.a. Capone
And I keep it fucking bouncing

[Chorus]
Bouncing side to side
Give it up to the day we fucking die
Don't ask why cause we ride all day
Stuck in the lost calles in Californ-i-a
Straight bouncing side to side
Give it up to the day we fucking die
Don't ask why and I'm sitting on chrome
What's my motherfucking name...Capone

Tick tock, tock it to the left
It's about nine thirty hit the 7 11
Got some zigzags and a bottle of Bacardi
Hit the straight bubbly looking for a party
Rollin in my homies ride
Bouncin up and down straight side to side
through a motion and we coastin non-stop
Pop drop the top and let me run up on the spot UHH
And you know I gots to get up on in
Win with the grin, bring her to the Holiday Inn
Then again, baby give 'em Bacardi, Juice an' Gin
Think again which one ?? for the looks of Virgin, Surgeon
But I'm workin I get up in the skirt an
Listen to belur if your scared go to church an
Ay Tupac but All Eyes On Me
Bouncin for the homies, the one and only, Capone-E uhh

Let it go, so let let lets bou bouce again
Cause it ain't over till it's over till I hit the fuckin pen
Then again once again I hit the late night strip

So mirror mirror on wall whose the biggest pimp of all
Call me the gangsta that falls on small or brawl

Take a chance on me
And let me show you
How wonderful true love can really be
I could love you for all eternity
Take a chance on me

I know you
Have been hurt so many times before
But let me show you
The kind of love that you've been searching for
Please believe me I couldn't love you more
Take a chance on me

I love you
Oh yes
I do
So why won't you
Take a chance
And lov'a me too

Mr. Capone-E," 
That's right all you bitch made motherfuckers trying to step on your toes
Drive by let you go we mob all the time on the south side
All you motherfuckers last man standing, can you feel me?

[Capone-E]
(Chukka, Chukka) As I hold my glock
Sur walking down the street and never will I fucking stop
Call the cops open shots as I hit the corner
Hi power soldiers from California to Arizona
Every corner got a soldier straight packing a chrome
Bumping Capone in the zone
All the haters on the phone
Speaking alone plotting on the heat to make me fucking quit
Think I got no corazón little leva what'chu think
You some shit eat a dick
When I'm flipping and gripping on you riders??? ???
South side to the fullest got my bullets on that
Checking next time when you're in the area on any motherfucker to disrespect
In a second use a weapon smith and westin or attack
Youngster or fucking vest who's get checked or to the next
Who gets rest pistol gripping always-staying strap
Capping while I'm always fucking laughing
Never the last man standing

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I keep standing
So grab your glocks
I keep standing
So fuck the cops
I keep standing
Always ready to ride
Flipping and slipping riming in my ride never will I hide

[Capone-E]
Be the last man standing straight banging from a side
Full of pride do or die west side when we ride
Homicide comes first putting work doing dirt
??? Was the heard representing my turf from birth never burst
So what you think that I bust never giving a fuck start throwing it up
On a rush on a ride competition want to cry
Trying not to be on my side but trying to draw me when I die
Oh god a bullet to survive everybody on the streets wants me to die
Never did I cry, puffing on tie getting me high seeing these devils in the sky
Walking by spreading around trying to dirty up my name
ain't a damn thing changed bow down to no man
Leave em In a jaw but I'ma state demanding
All on my own in the zone I be the last man standing

[Chorus]
[Capone-E]
Why you hating on me?
Cause you can't see the enemies in the fleece trying to eliminate me
On the streets concrete or get branded get every day with my motherfucking gage
ain't afraid of the net spent my up coming check with some spense on the place
Face to face with death nothing left grab the tap nevertheless I come with respect
Fuck the rest fuck the rest of them capone-e's the number one in the West
I'm just stressed but I'll never switch sides ride till I die never ask me why (why)
Murdering all my enemies watching them die
Open up your eyes cause Capone-E's full of pride
Bang bang gang bang 187 on my adversaries
Looking at the daily cemetery full of scary barely
Didn't I see you rot up in this dark fucking blast?
And I was hauling my own (Soy Capone)
It's for the last man standing

[Chorus]
[Outro]
That's right Ese
Never will I fucking hide
It's the mother fucking Mister Capone with that E
Keeping it notorious ese (oh I'm down)
Bow down to no man
That's right ese
Like I wise man once said
Those who step on your toes huh
Are really letting you grow
Cause motherfuckers like me keep it going
All you TV, tabloids, plus media, record label, engineers
Do no man do I fear ese
Cause you can't never hold a good man down huh
That's right
And like they said ese
It's not about the war of the lion it's all about that courage
You know motherfuckers like me keep putting it down and never will I stop
So all you motherfuckers remember that Big Capone-E with an E is here to stay
And in the end I'll be the last man standing (last man)

",Confessing a Feeling,2007
Mr. Capone-E,"Thank you lord for the cloud you made for me
I know you put the cloud there for all of us to see
That I have a home among stars to cure all my ills and
All of my scars... but I'm tired of living on a cloud alone.
I need a girl to help through my happy home.
I'm going to search and search this whole wide Milky Way
And I'm sure I'll find a girl someday.
To ride high on my cloud in the sky to live together
Until the day that we die but until that day I'll remain
Here on earth looking and searching for a girl that is worth.
To share my home and all that I own.

To love and guide me so I won't be alone.
The girl that I marry will live in my cloud and I'll do
My best my very best to make her proud.
Ohhh
That she married and carried for me,
Babies by the dozen maybe 1, 2, or 3 and on my wedding
Day I'll give to my wife, neck less full of stars for the rest of her life.
Thank you lord for answering my prayer for sending me
Down someone to share my love, my cloud who made me so
Proud. Thank you lord, thank you lord for answering my prayers.",My Cloud,2007
Mr. Capone-E,"I can't move a mountain top
Everything's ordinary on my block

I don't drive a beautiful car
And I don't own an elegant home
'Cause I don't have thousands to spend
Or a seaside cottage for the weekend

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Exclusive nightclubs are out of style with me
'Cause I don't associate with high society
I don't hang around playboy millionaires

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Subways take me downtown
My apartment is my home
I spend the weekends with friends
Otherwise I'm alone

Walk hard
Pay me no mind
You're ashamed of me
You girl

Walk hard passing by
Don't you know that I'm not the guy
Moving non-stop
You can't see beyond my block

I'm never gonna let you go, girl
Never gonna let you go
Need love so badly

",Ordinary Guy,2007
Mr. Capone-E,"(Chorus) 

Nothing like the summer time, baby 
Homies in the park go, crazy 
Cruisin' in the block with your, lady 
In the, in the, in the sunshine 
Kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(1st verse/different person) 

It's summer time and I'm feelin' so good, 
Wake up in the mornin' with the player's groove, 
The weather's hot and I'm in my drop top 
Me and my friends rollin' through the parking lot, 
Today's a good day so call out the DJ, 
Bring the Gatorade, it's a sunny day 
Love the way I'm so fresh and so clean 
Out in the sunshine, you know what I mean? 

(i don't know this line it's on 50-51 sec.) 
So it's time to chill 
I'm home and I'm relaxin' with the meat on the grill 
And for real, (whistle) the girl's lookin so fine 
Dressed to impress and the weather's ain't denied 
All the time, the homies bring the cars out, 
Black, white, brown, asians no doubt 
It's a holiday, it's a sunny day 
Summertime Anthem sing along hey! 


(Chorus) 

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(2nd verse) 

It's still hot as I reach the mid-day, 
Water balloon fight, as the kids play 
Another day in the summer sunshine, 
Kites in the air as the food get's pre-pared! 
All the fella's looking for the pretty girls, 
(the pretty pretty girls out in the summer world), 
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Fresh Prince, 
It's summer time again, let's reminice 
And how summer comes and goes and comes again, 
School's out, let's all have some fun again 
Everyone with the ringtones blowing up, 
It's the Summer Anthem song so you know what's up 
Play it loud, in the park, cruisin' in your ride, 
Everybody doing like these other kid times (?) 
Nevermind your problems, they go away 
It's summer time everyday is a good day 


(Chorus) 

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(3rd verse) 

Now it's 6 o' clock and it's feelin so good, 
Summer breeze straining throughout the neighborhood, 
Time to pack up the bags, 
And the roll on now, 
Tempting the giggles with the music playin' loud 
Toastin, like it was 94' 
Remembering the boulevard after the car show, 
Damit, those were the good old days, 
But the summertime's back and it's time to play

Geah 
(C'mon)
Sendin' this one right here
To all the girls out there that get down like they live
Fuck it
Roll with the Hoo-Bangers
Geah
You like the way I get down like y'all live
Check it out

y'all know the
Bitch I need, nuthin but cash and weed
Out of town trips, slips my cash with speed
Don't get it twisted, no Captain
But I'm cappin' and duckin'
While a hoe hides me out and I'm steadily fuckin'
Doin your thang
While I teach you how to hop on planes
Get this cream from this fool with the country name
Same day you get back, my bankroll stack
As a matter of fact, you know I like that
Sticky bitches have niggas straight spendin' they dough
Ya know cash runs everything around a hoe
Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'
I love the hoe
She's out to get my paper fo' sho'
Anytime and place she ready to go
Love scratch
No pigeon in the world could match
Simple as fuck
Hood rats ain't hard to catch
Geah

Hood rats
We lovin 'em ho's, we lovin 'em ho's
c'mon, geah
Sing with me...
c'mon geah

Sneaky cause she want to just fuck for ends
Fuck and spend, fuck, run tell yo' friens
All of y'all do their fuckin' shit
All your homegirl, bitch, who you fuckin' with
Gossip you spit
Put each other up on game
On which nigga's got chips, routine's the same
Shakin' that ass with the jiggle and twitch
In the club bustin', knowin I'ma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday
Fuck the bitch anyway
It ain't nuthin'
And leave suckas say: the bitch good for somethin
Anywhere, any day, any hour
In front of anybody, in the shower
Geah   

Hood rats
I'm lovin 'em ho's, I'm lovin 'em ho's
Geah ya know how it goes...
Hood rats...
Geah, check me out

Is she or she not the top notch?
Watch the peddle pushers and rocks in a ?????
How she cop, bitch flips, trips, no sleepin
Back to the club where she strips on a weekend
You know what I'm speakin' she's out to get yo' bread
???? up, choke up, showin some leg
Get down like you live and get down on a dime 
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine
Who is better?
I got the chedder ready to spend
With a video tape so I can record the date
Fuckin' with Eiht it's all good
Now back that ass up like you know you should
Know the game alive, toss chips
Watch you get down and start movin' the crowd
Geah, say it loud
Hoo-Bangers, we get down on that shit, you know

Sexy senorita, I trust in you 
You're my spiritual waking

Somebody told me that this could last forever 
Put my faith in the heaven that brought us together 
Holding hands in the park after dark 
Gazing at the stars 
Never see us apart

I'm growing up in the ghetto
And there was nobody happy 
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinkin up a way that I can get some dough
Man I'm tryin ta blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that steel pack
You know the lost boyz got
With timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats coverin the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live
Motherfucka 
Cuz everyday on the street 
The black man is gettin beat 
Police line us up on the concrete
Now people look at me 
And always see wrong
A new problem everyday
I'm tryin ta be strong
Now how strong can a nigga be
When the blacks is locked down
And the white man's got the key
It's gettin harder day after day 
Somebody got ta pay 
And in my closet lays an AK
The new cat is found dead
Plus when he killed the girl 
He put the gun to his own head
Ya never hear it on the 6:00 news
When my niggas get killed in the street over tennis shoes
It's hard enough for us blacks to earn cash man
The homeless keep warm by settin fire to a trash can
Now everyday I need ends
New shit my nigga weed
St. Ides is my best friend
Pa's is broke
No calls comin in on my phone
And money I'm down to my last stone
My mom dukes is always bangin on my door
My music's too loud
I got clothes on the floor (pick em up)
She doesn't understand
I'm cruisin in the fast lane
I'm fresh outta nerves
Ma, you're workin on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out 
But that's stuck in my brain
We're havin fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And comes home the next night
But that's the life that I live understands me
It's bad enough that Po-Nine tried ta can me
Ayo my lifestyle is rough
I got three sisters, four brothers
Man, ain't this enough?

Mr. Cheeks,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With  mans on linden and devane we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing glocks on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my reeboks
Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yeahyo
Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like norman bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gats
Carry across town because we tapping niggas hoodrats
But they don't want the fam
See a south side jamaica queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped
Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing levis and pro-keds
Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some powder head
(Freaky TAH) hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..
I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark
I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends
That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain
I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.
Fools make your moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes
Stepping to the CHEEKS you made an error
You been to the “house of pain” now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my tim chukkas
Who who you stepping to the lost boy crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street

Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a wanna I do what I gotta
Survive I might not be around in 95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We racking grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons
A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and big tig in Atlanta and Va.....

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do

Mr. Cheeks,"Here's a tune about this honey named Renee
That I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peepin' shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name
She said my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say
So may I walk you to your subway
She said if you want
So yo, we started talking
I brought two franks and two drinks
And we began walking
I had to see where that head was at
Because the gear was mad phat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for 
She wants to be a lawyer
In other words shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token
She drops a package of the EZ Rider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rock
I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly Blunts
She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts
I said, nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on I can get to show ya

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

Now we sittin' on train
Besides the fingernails
Now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket,with some jeans 
And a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog so we hit the store
Went to the crib
And turned the lights on
A crazy magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch
Stero system with crazy cd's
Understand kid
She got cheese
She said cheeks do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said alright well I'm gonna roll this blunt
She came back with strech pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, Fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chattin
We're smoking blunts on her balcony
We're stearing at Manhattan
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on her breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate
And a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted Bo to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever shorty rock
We can swing it like that
Cause on the real this is where it's at.

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow 
And this what the letter said
It said cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep
So I didn't want to bother you
I left a number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed
Smoked a blunt
Then I bounced to the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you
She's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty
Crack a 40 with my naughty freaks
A man, I never been in love
But everytime I'm burstin' in and outta state
It's shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee
Because Renee uses code two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She said Renee has been shot
So cheeks, meet me up at St. Lukes
I jumps on the Van Wyck
I gotta make it there quick
A yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po nine
I'm doing a buck
Who gives a fuck
I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital
They tell me Mr. Cheeks
Renee is gone 
I'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto
So listen
This is how I shed my tears

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by

Mr. Cheeks,"(Mr.Cheeks)
Yo we come through like balls, see us niggas takin two pulls and pass
Nigga watch your back once you talk out your ass
I pack a .380 in my stash for protection
Family deranged, the world is acting crazed
I never thought I'd make it, it was hectic when I scrambled
On point like a knife I'm living life as a gamble
Living in the rotten apple, yo where every corner is rotten
To all my niggas rest in peace, see you gone but not forgotten
Now my main wifey, dead as shady chicks,
Official Lost Boyz since the year of '86
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill 'em with a passion
At times I feel like slashing in Jamaican Queens fashion
You think you can fuck around, but kid you just thinking
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking
Without blinking man, I'll tear your crew like pages
I rip you from the backyard, and (?) in stages

(A+)
A plus the lyrically superb one, spittin rhymes
From the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums
Rotten shit, make the opposite team call time out
Knockin niggas three times my size out
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me
I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pellets,
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock
I speak out - my voicebox peak out at a hundred watts
Who wanna cipher, I get dumb
Word to my mother, the Father, the Holy Ghost and Rev Run
When the Source set it down, I'm inna service
To cop the kind of verses that average emcees will worship

(Redman)
My style is milk of magnesia, clutch the 5-speed and bust
The more the merrier, secure the area, my la familia
Is ultimate superior we don't jack cars
We jack for aircraft carriers
I bounce like trampolines, when I be blowing the fiends to pieces
Hymn em like sewing machines and Jesus
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my boy' Camarro
I get punished like pharaoh for splittin'
You're better off singing Christmas carols for Christmas
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment
The president of chicken head conventions
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'
I got a headache from the stress, success, not wearing a vest
511 for being dirty, quarts of 9-30
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police
She tried swallowing a nine piece
Forgot the warranty on false teeth
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's
Assault and battery like my palm says Eveready
Sharp as machetes
Matter of fact I slap the cardiac (?)

(Canibus)
Canibus brings the sickest drama
Fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through the condom
Playing with the mic is something I won't do
My only concern when I approach you, is to roast you
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you
Defeating niggas like Segal, Steven
Putting Emcees in positions to prevent them from breathin'
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers
What's the matter with ya'll, I splatter ya'll
Against the muthafuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
None of ya'll got the balls big enough to battle
I go On & On like Erykah Badu
A hundred times nicer than the best is
Twice as African as KRS is, who wanna test this?
Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me
An emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me
All that shit you poppin' will stop, when I put you in a headlock,
And apply pressure until I crush your muthafuckin noggin
I grab mics and push niggas to the left
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress
But if you want to battle, I'm down
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear
If you survive then you can cover up your scar with a beard
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks
Anyone who ain't feeling my shiddit can suck my diddick
You need to quit it, if you ain't spittin'
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack
All of ya'll muthafuckas need Nordictrack
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up
Beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up
Been rockin' longer than niggas twice my age
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin' a fade
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin' lifted
Stickin' dick to Eve before she was Adam's mistress
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness
The Canibus is spittin' til' he's spitless
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this
I'm puttin' every wack emcee alive on my shit list
Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted
Took you a minute to exhibit that I'm sick wit it
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit
Going once, going twice
Sold! to that nigga name Canibus
Me and Mr.Cheeks, A-Plus, and Funk Doctor
Hopping out the Huey helicopter to suey chop ya.

Mr. Cheeks,"this be a message to the ghetto when will this shit stop
we lost 2 ill niggaz B.I.G and 2pac
this goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
you can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
see you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
your life is how you living kid just give it your all
we strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
the plan's to make you niggaz understand, understood
yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
but that's all we know cause from the street we got the training

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast

yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
all the suffering we've been through niggaz still is into squeezing
mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
you rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
one night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
cause niggaz out there they felt that I owed them something
talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
a 13-year old could just up, and end me
if he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
now does that make shorty rock the man?
not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
it's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
that's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
so take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
to the motherfuckin day

I'm callin niggaz bluff yo my rap game be tuff
let's take it to the stage and let the lyric game buss
I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
to hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl

look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
that's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track
the media they tryin to throw dirt in the game
but me and my fam we found ways to explain
throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
it's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

It may sound lame but I truly adore you
And listen I will always go out for you
There's nothin' in the world a cat won't do
To show that his love is true for you
We'll take walks through the park at night
Spread love in the dark that's right
Once I had mad women on my list
On the real none ever made me feel like this
I wasn't frontin' when I said that I want you
Even though it took some time to confront you
We at home in the zone elaboratin'
I'm lovin' you, you lovin' me we be marinatin'
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

Put you through hard times but you still stay by my side
I provide anything that you want and need
But you don't mess with my liquor nor weed
Word to moms we could travel this world
See youse my wife no longer my girl
See people mad at the thing we got
Cause we come through the spot lookin' hot, why not
Is it a crime at times when I nag you
I know shiesty cats that wanna bag you
It's all good in my hood I did it too
What the hell this cat think he can do for you
That I don't, haven't already done
I used to deal with wicked chicks I found a steady one
As long as we keep it tight, build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't

We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

I know you've had your flashbacks of what we been through
But it's a whole different story when I mean you
Make it down to respect and protect you
And if any men disrespect you
Been through downs and ups, ups and downs
I wrote this here from the gut, how that sound
I lay it down while my man Chuck sings to you impressions
I bring to you glamourous life only for the wife
So others never give it baby livin' trife
Cherishin' all the moments that's excitin'
It's probably all of that cause I live fightin'
If you feelin' bored get your thing on
If I really didn't know you why'd I ring on
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

I'm at this chicks crib uptown 
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down 
Now it seems like a set-up 
and niggaz try to wet me from the door 
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour 
Shot through the glass hit the balcony 
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain

Mr. Cheeks,"Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus i love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I wont be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty cant wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we wont forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool 
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover 
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long 
Shorty had to go back to work 
Something inside said that will work

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be to demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding
Like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street get your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinkin to me short 
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to 
I had to run her down the line this aint no walk through 
Now who the fuck you think you talkin to chick
Your complaining's makin me sick 
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday I be there fo rmy friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word
She began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing byebye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
To many threats kid 
Got to let her go
Always in your corner 
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give
We talked out
I'm feeling pain as it come to an end
I said to shorty ""I will always be your friend""
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I aint going nowhere
For real

Where us real niggas love to get down
Where you only hear G and P finessin' tracks up on the tape
We stuck in Queens, and I'm not tryin to escape
Yo, I'm havin cess', drinkin; I'm kickin raps and Emceein'
LB for life, kid, my way of bein'
Its time to set up shops; wild in this game and got props
And fuck cops; we puffin' lah wit' windows up in drop tops
Nothin' stops my crew from gettin' it; we learn from the past
Puffin' on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass
Conversatin' with myself; what does my future hold?
Niggaz is dyin', will I make it past thirty years old?
I can't run; I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done
What the fuck's the deal? I been doin' this here from day one

Yo, yo
My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year
Three times it's likely to feel clear
A+, I transform into a super emcee
With super vocals, quicker than Superman can find a phone booth
The whole truth, nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you
Thermonuclear vocals get hotter than in Shanobal
The double O, just abide nuclear explosions
Exposin' radiation like a vulcan
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
Was stolen by five Soviet spies
They told me to lie; they don't want to hear the god spit
Chop my hands off at the armpits, but I regenerate limbs
Like star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin' arson
Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight
Down...

[Canibus]
Yo, A+, fuck the nonsense
I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand horsemen
And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here
I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremecy
Who want to get touched?
The Can-i-bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues, covered with leaves
Interrogatin' you whack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses
Askin' you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually
What happens to any motherfucker for tryin' to battle me

What the dilly fella
ain't nothing really
Getting money
Before we hit up top
Let's hit the spot and cop a twenty
Hit the southern states
So we can bounce
Regulate
Throw a tape in
Join this new joke
Smoke escaping
Windows tinted
They coming down cars on my horn
It's my mom on the other end singing a song
When the clock ain't a ?
You at a spot to perform
Kid I'm down with getting paper
Pulling capers like storm
No doubt
Hang up the phone and continue to murk
Ghetto star in the game put a name on my shirt
Got this one chick on the ? I stop to see
Runs with a team of chicks living 1-6-3
They be buying it playing space PlayStation and all
I thought I heard the cops saying I'm going to give them a call
Get some juice play some hard
Yo I'm spinning my yards
Get my lines lined up
Smell good for the guards
Get my shine
Shine my baby
Then I'm making my flash
Lay my hand on shorty rest until it's time to make cash
Call her up on her cell
What's the deal on your half
I'm just ? up for chickens
I just got out the bath
I'm around the corner baby
Is there something you need
Just bring yourself now say no more

[Chorus: x2]
We do this all night
Got fellas spending money shorties looking right
Either twist the cap or pop a cork
This is how we getting down up top New York

We on the couch chilling
Everybody getting right
Complimenting shorty
Spandex fitting tight
Press the power down
Grab the sticks
Hit us on
Cause I'm sick of hearing my man singing that same song
Yo I'm going to bring it to you live
Mad 98
I'm going to get up in that ass
Shorty fix me a plate
Fried chicken French fries cold pepsi with ice
A minute left and I ? night
My only shorty
You wouldn't believe it with a bun in her hair
Said she want to hit the cut
That's music to my ears
Hit the bedroom
Shorty smelling like perfume
Grabbed the condom out my pocket because it's on I assumed
Seen her face blown out
Time to lay down my law
Lights down
Music on
Perfect time to score
Victoria secret's ?
You know how I'm feeling
When you laid up with a shorty getting money and chilling
Got a show in an hour
So I jump in the shower
My man napping
He know that we got to make it happen
He in the zone caught in the mix
Oh damn
Can't be mad at situations that me and my man dig
Well it's your luck shorty
Go wake his ass up
Got a move to make can't afford to pass up
So go tell your to go
Tell my man let's roll
It's all said and done
Jump in my whip
Take flight
As I switch lanes
Throw on my signal light
Fake rappers get they ass ate up

[Chorus: x2]

Smoke everyday
Yelling my name
I rip a show
Peep shorty and her friends assing out in the front row
Spilling mo'
Grabbing my jeans
Yelling my name
I'm used to it now guess it's all part of the game
Let me explain how I grab the mic
Move and finesse
Shorty in the blue dress
Body screaming caress
Took her to the rest
Lay her body down on my nest
It's deep in the this game
Why she got my name on her chest

These mothafuckas made it this way
I show 'em mine

Official Queens crack stars gettin money
Rollin trees in the backwoods
Timberlands, ???, black hoods
The territories rugged, certain bimbos love it
I fuck wit cats ???
Keep my Timbo's covered
We ride around in the streets, kid we duckin knicks
Money power wit some game, kid we fuckin chicks
The hard times help me sharpen up
We be in Watts, but still be sparkin up
Love it when the day darken up
My life is like a movie, big guns and booze play a part
I came through to display an art
Yo, fuck you jealous niggas
I take care a fam and I lay low
I'm livin kid, I got the money plus the yayo
And hold a heat up on the seat because it's gettin wicked
You get yo dough, I get my dough
Let's blow so we can kick it

Yo is you mothafuckas out a yo mind?
We them niggas that be holdin it down
Half of the reason you live
Other fifty percent of the reason you frown
Behind the back you pop shit
But when we be wavin them thangs you innocent
Cause we in this bitch, Raw Dogs
Is you askin for a New York City war call?
We keep it gritty for all a why'all
But some you niggas act like you goin through menopause
And that's the second we send 'em to morgues
Slay 'em down, get in them drawers
Been put on, what you tellin me for?
Look at 'em beggin for more
Either they yellin or givin applause
Picture livin laws while we got x-cons on the dance floor
Goody niggas playin the wall
And ??? bitches rockin hoodies wit razors inside the sports bra
We told why'all but ya wasn't tryna listen to us

Ever since the day I was born my lifestyle been real
Bloody stories on blank paper is what my pen spill
My men still, sellin coke, cooked up and powdered out
In a big body smoked out, shit is clouded out
We official crack stars, bury bodies in back yards
You neva touch nothin
Sayin you blast niggas and clap cars
I get a back massage from a bad European
And switch my bird every season
And I'm rollin up my treason
But my question is, give me one reason to let you live
But you good at talkin ya way out a shit, I be you is
So I sex ya wiz, kill you, and leave ya wife left wit kids
Ghetto black widow
What nigga, my mac glitto
Attack ya hitto
It's like pimp talk wit a limp walk
And crazy dough is what I'm in for
Somethin you bent off, but couldn't touch
Scream you got guns but wouldn't bust
Never fuck wit niggas out a my circle I don't trust

When love, takes me over
Its paradise
When love, takes me over
It's always nice

VERSE

Touch pon di ends
And a incense, herbs and oils
Scrapbook newspaper
Clippings and files
A view of di countryside
Remind me of nine miles
Where di trees are green
And di people smile
After few water crackers
And some warm milo tea
Rub massage home made
Coco butter skin cream
Interior design of
Ights gold and green
And the vibes are pure
And the thoughts are clean

She collect her own
Dividends weekly
So mi know ah no money
Mek she seek me
Cool me down
And tie mi knotty dem neatly
Draw close
While whispering sweetly
Mi teach her each and everytime
That she link me
We haffi bun
A five bills bag a stinky
True she roots and culture
She win me
I even had to
Introduce her to Cindy

VERSE (Mr. Cheeks)

VERSE

Well I was sitting
By an open fire place
In my flavorite dungarees
I play a few strums
Upon my guitar
And It sounds so good to me
Big skunky blunt a blaze
And plus
My flavorite stooks beside me
I glance over
Just so I could see her
But my locks got in the way

Cool breeze a blow
Through the weeping willow
She always leave
A fragrance on my pillow
When I'm ready
She will always follow
Me to the place of
My old sleepy hollow
Soft silky voice is
So sacred and hollow
Cause out spoken noisy
Streams run shallow
Reach to the stars
When I launch the Apollo
Could a land up ah Sao Paulo

Hey yo, that bum nigga rappin,' took it the top, now I won't stop
I remember bein' broke cause if I didn't nigga
I'd be frontin,' reminisicin' where your nigga at?
Ain't nuthin,' never thought about the hot outfits, jewelry or the celly
Back then we was in the skelly
Shorties with the barrettes, candy in the bag
The handgun, remember when we shot the fair one? 
A nigga like me had the motherfuckin' pro players and my Lees on 
For a nickel got my squeeze on 
Fly balls off the wall in the schoolyard  
Swear to gods got my first quickie in school garage

[Chorus]
I remember those days
You and I gettin' paid
Now we got it made, oh yeah
I remember, I remember

[Verse 2: Mr. Cheeks]
Aiyo, we open gates and let the dogs chase us home after school 
Until my nigga Skee got bit, yo, but that was cool
We took him to the crib we laughin', growin' up 
We drinkin' liquor on the stool while he throwin' up
We runnin' from school security, besides that the 102 cops 
Yo, the man was my grandpops
He used to air me out, he never tried to even motherfuckin' hear me out 
No punishment, but here we out
We back at it again, me and my men 
Yo what was realest when us niggas ?????
And all we want to know does anybody fuckin' care?
And why this trouble follow me every fuckin' where?

Aiyo, we used to hot wire cars, bragged about the scars we collected 
Tryin? to escape from them older guys up at the bars
They never let us bang, let's act ???????
We knew they had a crew, but yo our crew was thick
OK, now we graduated from junior high
We into badder bitches, caine, getting money yo, we livin? fly
We got the Jordan and ball, we got the weed and all
When Chris died yo we felt there was no need to fall
We seen it all, from welfare lines, all them good and bad times
Back then I wish I had rhymes
I got my childhood name from my wild hood
Sling still, as though it was a good thing

Eh, excuse me dime piece,

You know my cousin D2, yea that's my people
I always ask about you, I guess I spoke you up
I swear if you was trees, I'd roll, light, and smoke you up (Yeah)
And I'm not kidding with you, for real a nigga dig ya
But can we hang out, spend some time, that's what I'm trying figure
Live alone, got a style all your own
Cinnamon complexion skin tone, I know you been grown
The mouth is statured with a work, for real it got me hurting
Of course a nigga flirting, come from behind that curtain
I got some more deliveries but yet I be back
And when I get back I want to see that (see that)
Matter-a fact gimme that number lemme hit you on the arm
By the time I get back you be gone (be gone)
Yeah, I got that number from her, 'cause after work she outtie
Headed back to the crib where she can live and get it clouty
At eight o'clock, we meet up at that after-work spot (Yeah)

Yeah, hey yo,
We meet in front the jazz spot, she looking right as ever
Boosting master gloves, them gloves that master leather
Smile when she see me, I guess I'm looking comfy
She grabbed my hand and walked in front me, man I think she want me
Got a table for two in the rear
Cause over there, you's allowed to throw something in the air
Music sounding good, we hopped up out our chairs
I'm close up on them smells, we're burning L's and bears
We had a few drinks, we ate a meal and all
This night and her cousin, for real I feel it all
She got me wide open, I guess she wide too
Cause she done told me anytime I want to slide through
That I can slide through, I take you on that offer
I had to warn her, laughed and joked a bit, now I'm back up on her
Not tonight but give me some time, I'ma bag you
And make you my permanent Ragu

Mr. Cheeks,"Aiyo, my first thoughts was stop when my man left
I started drinkin' more thinkin' of my mans death
Then I thought he wouldn't want to see me crumble
When he handed me the ball I promised I won't fumble
And I won't, stood on the field implore the real
These player haters hate so much now they resolve to kill
Got your pictures it ain't the same without the laugh
I pour liquor in the grass think about the past

If there was no one I could speak with I could speak with you
You knew all I was into what I've been through
They couldn't fuck with us kid we was off da chain
Blew the spot up when we came and got inside the game
From street cats we brought it to the main stream
It was an honor playin' with you on the same team
Your namely a very great deal to me
It's only right I step it up you kept it real with me

And when that day comes
We're gonna be like every children
And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves

Aiyo, I'm thinkin' yous about to come through at any minute
Bless your nigga on the track, put some flavor in it
Just a thought, I'm knowin' that you're not around
Can't forget how we did it in and out of town
Held it down, maintained, still inside the game
Listen ever since you left it hasn't been the same
Niggaz change, fam lookin' at me strange
Was goin' on with cheeks peeps hating different things

No doubt I'm hearing everything they say
He don't live around they way, why should I stay?
I play the hook but don't stay understand that
I bein' on the block ain't bringin' my man back
Those who know me know me straight love they show me
They can't hold me in the game aiyo wassup with Oby
Maintain in talkin' to my lost souls, see you when I get there
Meet you at the Crossroads

And when that day comes
Is when I get a chance to tell you I love you
And when that day comes
We gonna be yea yea yea yea

What went wrong all I know is that
My mans one that made my mens strong
On my own two I stand on right along I think
About how we were like the bomb
Right before we perform let me write a song
How you used to do, represents all you knew
Aiyo Taliek 21 gun salute for you
On top of losing you I lost you in the worst way
Now that's some shit them niggaz killed you on my birthday

Open presents nah said my nigga Tai dead
Celebrating birthdays with that shit in my head
Think about the time when we would chill
Up in 1 and 2 in back in Richmond Hill
Yeah that shit was real, us young niggaz growin' up
Whoever thought we would start bubbling and blowin' up
But we did, survived it all I wish you did
And I could speak for all the boys we miss you kid, yeah aiyo

And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves
And when that day comes
And we gonna be yea yea yea

And on that day we'll need together
And we will be like
And on that day we'll need together
And we will be like

And on that day we'll need together, oh yeah

Me and my crew, man, we don't got the same dimes
Don't got the same style, don't got the same rhymes

Ay yo, this shit is major, blow my cell and pager
Say, ?I love but hate ya, love my cousin Hasha?
I'm in the strap game tight, I'm in the mix of things
Ay yo this spot here is only for the folks who came

Why were the niggas talkin'? You better keep on walkin'
You reppin' Queens nigga, I'm reppin' East New York
We keep the blunts sparkin' keep all the bitches talkin'
Stop all the yappin' nigga, before you in a coffin

Yo why you startin' Cheeks and then I stop to cough
On this track like a newborn orphan, I stay boss face
Up in the club flossin' with Dave Chanel
I just met him but I be tossin'

Yo before this niggas did it I had to Yankee fit it
With the black bandannas, yo this shit bananas
They think they doin' them, they really doin' me
They think they doin' are O L Q L E

They need to knock it off, I got the bank tight
Ay yo I'm back up in this game as if I'm Frank White
It's time to give it to these niggas, kid it's really time
No doubt you gettin' burned, you need to learn to rhyme

Fuck from a dummy nigga, it's nothin' funny nigga
We rockin' gold fronts way before cash money nigga
The wife beat if off, I keeps the heater warm
You thought G was gone and now you see it's on

I keep it really raw, that's how we give it to 'em
I'm holdin' down my G's we need to get to doin'
I got these kids growin', at least they right behind me
I live in 2 0 7, East New York you know where to find me

Ay yo let's get this money, let's stash some real estate
No doubt I feel the love, no doubt I feel the hate
It's no stopping us, some corny niggas hatin' us
Who pushin' us back to back, who skatin' us

On twenty inches now, with my tens down
I push a truck now, don't give a fuck now
I got my ho with me, she wanna roll with me
You wanna smoke with me? Well, bitch roll up with me

Yo, I keep it low key, the whole world know me
I put a lot of niggas on, niggas owe me
Niggas know how I get down, how I do
I know I bit off more than I could fuckin' chew

Ay yo I hit you nigga, never forget you nigga
Dynamic duo, you's a slim grim, I'm holy chulu
The greatest tag team ever, got our shit together
Yo I'm a field jacket, yo I'm a butter leather

Let's get it on lights out
Wipe your eyes don't cry
This love we got it won't die

I promise this no lie
As long as we both try
To come close and make it work
I know deep down it hurt

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

Kiss and make up
I know that will be hard
I love from the start
Now your hearts been scarred

I stand here alone, I feel like the dirt
You lost your main squeeze fuck her nice work
The whole town is laughing at me I'm a clown
I smile on the outside but inside I frown

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

I apologize for all I have done
Caught between the walls I can't run

I sweared I wish I had you here

Excuse the way I act no good

Never again I'll put you through it

I know at times I let you down

If it were me ask myself could I take it
In my heart as a man might not make it
Honestly sincerely truthfully I come to you
Despite all that I do yeah we can, yeah, yeah

Just When I think I'm gettin' on without you
Somebody Passed and asked me about you

Was in the back of the cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking passed the other way
My heart rushed, my face flushed
Tell the driver hit the breaks slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to
Damn, can the affects of Love and time
Cause the mind to trick the eye?
I wonder how you gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eyes
But you still just get the five
You break the bank to spend the time

Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no

Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

And when I'm wit cha it's like I don't want to leave again
Without you listen I don't want to breathe again
You give me a lot and everyday you giving more
So there's no need to tell you who or what I'm living for
I miss ya very much shit I miss ya every touch
And I know you'd come through for me in the clutch
I'm on the road with my peeps and I know I'm moving
But yet the time we spend together that's so soothing
Love it how we do shit I pour a drink for ya
You pour a drink for me and always think of me
I call you when you when I'm home I know you bored and all alone
I want to come and scope you up and place you in the zone

I know I put you through some shit but yet you stayed with me
Messing with them other chicks it's only games they play with me
Searching for something I had with me all the time
I made a change, my love to you I'm giving all of mine
Send you cards in the mail to show you that I care
Shit a life without you is the only thing I fear
So I'm a make sure a nigga hold it down for
The foundation wishing I could be around more
But you know the drama gotta keep a nigga running
I bugged out with the crew it's only you I'm wanting
Call you on the horn to hear you on the other end
""Mental hugging giving my loving to no other men""
This one's personal so keep it close to you
Be there for each other that's what we supposed to do
And anything you want I make sure you get it
And anything you into babygirl you know I'm wit it
Holla when you ready for me...

Yeah, listen don't mean to burn your ear out
But this is something you should hear out
Right now
Shit I'd give you the world
I'm a make it home to my babygirl someway or somehow
Ain't afraid to tell ya how your fella feel 'cause your fellas real
And on the real girl you're hella chill
I hope you get the message by the end of this
Wanted you from the start, from the heart I'm sending this
This my last gig I'm on my way home
And we can go and paint the town or we can stay home
It don't matter what we do as long as I'm wit you
Spend some time wit you, you know what I'm a do
Get it on wit you just like the first time
There's no need for this man to rehearse mine
Superstar wit ya, back-to-back and far wit ya
Without a doubt I'm going all out for wit ya

I'm encourage to fakes the pain and

You just spark enough faggot ass I've been blunted
I gotta team in every borough New York nigga
Watch how you talk, watch where you walk nigga
These jumps wear their steak suits so lets eat 'em up
They ain't worth it because I let our bitches beat 'em up
Fuck the star shit I'm up in the bar with
Cast a hustle of the prove we got muscle man
Before you haters out there that can't see me
Mad because your girlfriend bump my CD
Your read easy live with your corny stash
Or get gun up when we run up on your corny ass
Back up off us nigga you the softest
Actin like you sold crack with coppers and officers
Flash back shell-toe thick strings and jewelery
RIP to Freaky-Tah Mike and Cooly-be

[Verse 3]
I keeps a Yankee fitted on tracks is spitted on
I have no problems showing mine we can get it on
Its never hate believe me its strictly fact yo
Your corny rap flow match your corny rap show
Shine ahead niggaz time to get niggaz
How y'all coming with that bullshit you spit niggaz
Take a time out you really not moving nothing
Killing me with your fronting like your moving something
To them so called friends of mine that gayed out
You niggaz played out I'm glad you niggaz stayed out
Fuck the crab shit the best of friends is living well
I know you niggaz see me doing me I'm giving hell
Pass the mic crew never did like you
Getting comfortable niggaz ain't invite you
You lame niggaz I'm as hot as a flame niggaz
You know why I'm in this game niggaz

This cowards walking with a complex here
We drop him so quick we from the crib to the film set

If you want your stripes you got to earn them yo
This goes out to you and you and you
And if you feel it in your heart yo it must be true

With her emotional rescue of love
That you'll leave torn apart, check it out, uh

That girl thinks that she's so bad
She?ll change my tears from joy to sad, come on
She says she keeps the upper hand
?Cause she can please her man

She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong, ooh, yeah
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her that I love her, that I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
I tell her that I?d love to, that I want to

?Cause a club hot man that's not in her zone
Would know to slip in time to be home
Yo?, dime piece, she stay on my mind, let?s be gone

She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong, yeah
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her I love her
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand, oh, yeah
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand

She says her love?s been cryin? out
But her lover hasn't heard, oh, no
But what she doesn't realize
Is that I've listened to every word

that's why I know I?ll tell that I love her, that I
want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
I tell her that I?d love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to, to be in her

In a minute I'ma intervene on the internet
You want to enter the mind from closer, to intercom
And dot com for Complex styles
Plus how it mold ya skull
Ask Moulder and Skully from the X-Files
Those wild-asses broke into my crib, lookin for clues
Went through my rhyme books, I thought they were crooks
So I beat 'em like they stole somethin
I'm tired of shit - I told 'em for the umpteenth time
You can't battle me with my own rhyme
He said ""Yo ya rhymes just so phat!""
I said ""Ya don't know what phat is"" - He said ""No diggity""
He kept begging me, I tryed to figure how he,
know so much on this topic
Just then I noticed Ebonics 1 hanging out his pocket
I said ""What's that in your pocket?""
He said ""Getcha hands out my pocket""
His chin was slow so I socked it
He fell back and pulled out a gat, and pointed it at
And rata-tat-tat - And Skully screamed no
Just then I knew I had fractions of a second just to kick a flow
But yo, the shots missed
You can blame it on the rhyme invention...
Or divine intervention

Red pillow, eyes heavy, droopin, they're closin, I'm comfy
I'm driftin, dozin, expand, Sandman, dreamland
I'm havin visions of improvisin on the mic
The audience is risin to huge heights
You should see how they screamin,
it's like I'm runnin 'em over with a truck
What the what? The record's causin a ruckus
I bust back with the word, the word provoked the herb
The herb provoked the verb, the dream broke when I hit the curb
Whoa, I can't distinguish my dreams from the real
I'm not even in bed, I'm sittin up behind the steering wheel
I gotta stop this goin two days without sleep
I'm takin in two lanes, then I hear two beeps
I keep on 'cause I'm only minutes from my crib - I struggle all my might,
but it's all over when I pull up to the red light
Last thing I recall was makin a left on the conduit to Rocker Way
Thought I could do it 'cause I was a block away
I gave it my best, never-the-less, I blacked out..
The scene I tried to act out 'cause I don't know how I got home
Was it the rhyme I was kickin off the dome?
Or was it I was just never alone?
Never alone.. never alone..

Clear. That's right, I hope u don't mind, if I take you on a trip like this.

I remember, like it was yesterday growin up everyday lookin for a place to play,
Riding bikes hopping on some pegs and handle bars
Going to the liquor store to steal a
Couple of candy bars,
Life was simple go to school get home
Make some trouble in the
Neighborhood all day long
I remember getting suspended always was a class clown
Always gettin into fights because I never backed down
I remember 6th grade when I
Smoked my first cigarette
Always around foos that smoked bud but didn't hit it yet
I Remember gettin drunk off my very first bud light
Damn what a saturday night
I remember Getting home late makin my mom mad
I remember growin up in a house with no dad
I Remember being told that family is all that we had
I remember those days still remember The past.

I remember all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,
I remember we would cruse around, ready for some shhh to go down,
I remember like it was yesterday.

I remember getting a little bit older developed an attitude and got a chip on my shoulder,
You know that teenager that thought he knew it all was the same teenager in n out of
Juvenile hall, I remember being chased by the cops replaced my lunch money with a
Sack in my sock, I remember when the homie shy boy got his first regal ducking
In the backseat hiding from my p.o, I remember the homie Cesar scratching records with
A needle us two techniques a sack of yesca and some pisto, Me and the homie Ruben
Always used to stay at each others house, eleven years later, and we're still smoked out,
I remember me n the homies used to go to gang of parties get drunk without throwin
Up that would happen hardly, I remember back in the days there wasn't nothin on our
Mind except for havin a good time I remember those times.

I remember, all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember, all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,
I remember, we would cruse around, ready for some shhh to go down,
I remember, like it was yesterday.

And I remember when I bought my very first strap and still remember when I got my very
First tat my first jack my first blast my first sack when I started to first rap I still remember
My first track, and on the real I still miss those days close my eyes turn the page it was
Real in those days, fortunate I'm still free instead of still in the cage a gang of the homies
Still locked up cause they still live those ways, now I'm left here with nothin but a memory
Gangstas don't cry so I pour a glass of Hennessey, smoking a gang of marijuana like it
Was a remedy reminiscin reading letters all the homies said to me, It's meant for me to
Bring the world these very special memories homies from elementary stuck in
Penitentiaries it's left to me, to reflect on those days don't really wanna turn the page
I remember those days.

I remember, all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember, all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,

I remember, like it was yesterday.

I sure do homie, like I said. I remember, as a matter of fact, how can I forget, you know
What I'm sayin. haha yea, 2007, we're gonna keep bringin these jams, that you can bump,

Mr. Curt Ensemble,"I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies). 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Beauty reaches for the light
From the shadow of your smile
Into my arms

There's a flower in my field you know
Holding love up like a shield
Now I know we have it sealed
Here in my heart

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

Where the stream begins to flow
A life of love that springs you know
From every word
Into my soul

Treasure buried deep inside
Turns the hands way back in time you know
Leaving all our past behind
Can we let it go?

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

We've been holding on
For things to change
The fear is gone
We've turned the page

In the book of love
And to know this love
Is to own it all 
From high above

I feel the call
Of your love

Dalvin. 
First let me get some weed before I wreck it.

Where the reefer at, where the reefer at?
Run me in the dime, not trying to bust my head
Cause I stays on top of mine (top on mine)
Cause I been ballin' since the days of back when
Niggas wasn't be thinkin' about drink no juice and gin (alright brother)
Niggas be drinkin' the Thunderbird or Night train
Lookin' for the right frame, breakin' like a dice game
Stackin' skrilla so I'm sippin' Hennessy
Lickin' shot after shot at my enemies
Boom boom recognize all pursuers been in the game for years
Cause I'm a sure connoisseur
Consume the blocks, drop off my rocks, the quicker a nigga play me
The quicker a nigga who drops, pops of the glocks
Not trippin' facial experessions, be shittin'
Niggas don't be hearin' all that in every city
Take a nigga out if you gotta on the day to day
Then parlay, ate a gator, parlay, to God nigga

[Chorus]
It ain't hare to see, when niggas try to be like me
A true O.G., why y'all why y'all, gotta take you underground
Parlay all day with the niggas from the basement sound [Repeat: x2]

[Mr. Dalvin]
Watch out for I blow, swing low
Forget it, why y'all don't hear me though, I'm hittin' switches
Hoppin' like a 64, and I, thought you knew, what I can do
Able to leap tall building and run up to your crew (oh)
The underground stylistical, got more flavors than mystics
So lay back and watch this nigga kick it
Wicked without thinkin' of funky
But I ain't stinkin', I know I got you open cause I got why y'all niggas
Blinkin'
Check it out, you watch me devastate this track
I make stacks and stacks and leave niggas on they backs
Cause I, be a sharp shooter, intruder
Rugged and rough, poppin' off just like a lueger
Now how many niggas, want to get down, while I say
With Jodeci or the basement sound, around
I don't want to see, handin', my crew is deep and you know that we be bangin'
So give me a bottle of Boons so watch me load my gat
Start a war like Tom Barringer in Platoon
So, don't mess with this flow, Mr. Dalvin is gone like 19 nigga fiz-o, oh

[Chorus]

Come on get down [Repeats]
This goin' out to all the players
Shoot outs to the ballers
Much love to the hustlers (all around the world)
Mo power to the pimps
Watch the basement make it mo better (like that)
Niggas just down for whatever, whatever

Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show

but ain't too much sadder than

I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown

Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression

Well if you see me chewin baby guts locc, would ya choke?
I vomit when that teflon pierce that babys throat
Peep me eatin dead cock
Ya trip cus eatin dead pussy clit'll make ya sick
But its that season so my reason is legit
I'm havin fits, I've dreamed of eatin bloody pussy clit since I was 6
I fiend for dead pussy on my dick, I got the schitz
Meanin I don't give a shit about yo biatch
That nigga that's from the block killin off that cock
So nigga, sheeeit
Baby barbeque ribs and guts, and uh
don't let me get to deep fryin baby nuts
Sluts, get ate out like a ? them crooked teeth hurt
I pull that tampax string out and straight put in work
It wouldn't work without the sick
So page a nigga quick so I can serve you some of that shit
And have you murderin your biatch, violently
I've been keyed for 20 minutes and feel like killin
Loadin that milli-milli its that infant killa
Nigga Lynch, Mr. Doc, D-O double M and hella heat
Niggas unload, I need another dose of human meat
Outlive the creek, and black market death by the scene
As that nigga that nigga that nine millimeter punch you in yo spleen

[Chorus] X 4
[Mr. Doctor]
You lay yo eyes up on my 4-4
And notice every curve in my strap
As them tears roll down
Flash yo life as ya fade to black
If that gat wasn't all up in yo face
Reminisce of yo folks, yo bitch, yo kids, yo fate
Replace, take it down to the South, get deep
Think of mobs at your funeral locc, and all ya family
Huh, its kind of crazy you could lose all of these things so quick
And what's worse, nigga shot you for the fuck of it, yeah
Never know I'd be the one to have your life in my hand
[Brotha Lynch: That Ruger 4-4 Mac]
That niggas life won't last
Keep listenin while I guide right down into your throat
Dig that barrel in your neck, watch your bitch-ass choke
No hope, no joke, I'm savin you the pain of old age
All I ask for is yo muthafuckin grip in exchange
One to the brain, in the throat out the skull
From the big chrome gat, peeled cap relation, so
Now ya niggas know, one mo dead muthafucka on the street
Fo the Mista Doc, locc
Straight to the brain with St. Ides brew
The black market dealt murder when they serve them foo's

Mr. Doctor,"(Hook)
How can I get so far gone
When can I move on
Dreading a world that'll never go on
If I took the time replace
Only mine erased
'Cause I feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

(Mr. Doctor)
I heard a lil' tale about to children sittin on the kitchen floor
They eatin mayonaise out the jar and they moms out smokin dope on the stroll
Man, you believe this
Life is complete for them
And it ain't no emotions, only instinct
And that's how they'll be raised by the streets
A boy and a girl
Just up the boulevard from your world
Oh it ain't all gravy where you at
'Cause that's where he gon' go to jack
Catch his first case at, become a disgrace at
But not in this world up the boulevard
I'ma see to hit that liquor, starts so easily
The difference people in my life are dyin and I see this
My question is, to what lengths do we go so that they live
'Cause I'ma reach this
My locc's mean everythang to me, life is an odysea
But sometimes, you don't step up and take the reigns
Man, the world'll play you cheap, should I ride

(Hook)

(Slim Loc)
I'm picturin kids cryin, a head firin up dope over the stove
Family car gettin repot because they couldn't cover the note
Nobody knows what's to eat because there's no groceries
And the baby suffers from a rash 'cause he hasn't been changed in over a week
The oldest keeps things together, by scramblin up some powdered eggs
She's only 5, so why her mom can't keep them pimps from out her face
How could they rape in that arrestin
The mother won't admit, but she's molested, diseased and infested
With wing worms, both of her legs covered with ring burns
She cleans up, but whoever heard of some clean germs
I seen the, hurt in her mama's eyes, she tramatized
Been beat up, ever since her father died, no harmonize

(Hook)

(Mr. Doctor)
It's hard for me to talk about the good things in my life
With all the things I did for stripes
And the way I made my gramps and my mama cry
This life is real, and I ain't got time to care about you
Just sell smack to you, and sell crack to you, and sell a sack to you
Never give back to you, unless you know me and you owe me
And never worry about your dreams, that's you the bigga the lil' homie
Here to corrupt you for sho', like my pops did and he did it wrong
Now he lost everything he owned and he lost everyone he knows
Here to corrupt you fo' sho'
Like a ??? showin you the ropes
And introduce you to all kinds of good stuff like alcohol and weed smoke
And dice games, take you to places you may die
And the whole time we rollin, I'ma say, man, this the real way to survive
Understand this

Mr. Easy,"She's got the touch I love so much, that's all I ever wanted (i'm surely god blessed) 
Under her spell she had me crushed I sworn I was anointed (*got caught* by her magic)

Like taking candy from a child (stuck on her love potion)
I can't believe the changes I've made since I met my baby, you know

[Chorus: x2]
She drives me crazy (on and on) what a beautiful lady (on and on)
She drives me crazy (on and on) and there's no if's nor maybes she goes (on and on) 

Like a volcano she erupts blowing up my pager (every minute every hour)
I realized she likes my *stuff* I chose the right flavor (this moment I'm a savor)
I've never trusted pretty smiles ('cause looks are deceiving)
Sexy walk my love profound (pretty girls are misleading)
Lesson learned don't judge a book by looking at the cover, you know

[Chorus]

My life my time and my *heart I've* dedicated to her (thats the *love* she wanted)
*I'm saying this I'd never starve* 'cause she is my dream maker (and now we gonna flaunt it)
Thank god I'm stuck with her for life (she's having my shorty)

And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume

And passion burns you like never before

Excuse Me mister do she got a sister
Who he not to kiss her True she do got a blister
Not a movie plot twist like a twistler
If I needed my meat burned I'd go to Sizzler
Getting paid like a biker with the best crank
Sprayed like a high ranked sniper in the West Bank
Type to just blank and don't show much pitty
When I'm in the city I always keep a dutch with me
Touch her titty till she ask me where the trees is at
Or tell me don't squeeze that rats wanna tease a cat

A snow-white dove in the pitch-black night
A rain drop falls from tremendous heights
A wave crashes off of a cliff in Scotland
A child bites an apple, but the core is rotten
TV is free, but what is the cost?
We have GPS and yet, we're still lost
A carrot in the desert, a camel in the garden
A man with giant ears begging your pardon
What if a garbage man was actually smart?
A common misconception that we're tearing apart
And to a dog, dog food is just food
And to a sock, a mansion's just a big shoe
A Milk Dud, sitting in the acid rain
A housecat addicted to the cocaine
No teeth, unlimited floss

A number-one dad trophy covered in rust
An nun dunked in basketball living the impossible

World like a smart oyster full of pearls
Such as has an ultrasound of a new baby
With a Santa hat drawn on, yeah that's my kind of Christmas card
What if a butterfly was made out of butter?
These small thoughts could destroy Big Brother
The world's cutest kittens just hugging a dog
Just one of our incredible thoughts
What if one thought could cure the people?
What if one song could end all evil?
Imagine if a fish could play guitar
And also sing, it would sound bizarre like
""My name is Mr. Fish
These guys thoughts have granted my wish""
And that may have just changed the course of time

Mr. Garrison,"I heard there is no Christmas
In the silly Middle East
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus
They have different religious beliefs

They believe in Muhammad
And not in our holiday
And so every December
I go to the Middle East and say

""Hey there Mr. Muslim
Merry fucking Christmas
Put down that book the Koran
And hear some holiday wishes.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday.
So get off your heathen Muslim ass
and fucking celebrate.

There is no holiday season in India I've heard
They don't hang up their stockings
And that is just absurd!

They've never read a Christmas story.
They don't know what Rudolph is about
And that is why in December
I'll go to India and shout

Hey there Mr. Hinduist
Merry fucking Christmas
Drink eggnog and eat some beef
And pass it to the missus.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday
So get off your heathen Hindu ass
and fucking celebrate!

Now I heard that in Japan
Everyone just lives in sin
They pray to several gods
And put needles in their skin.

On December 25th
All they do is eat a cake
And that is why I go to Japan
And walk around and say

Hey there Mr. Shintoist
Merry fucking Christmas
God is going to kick your ass
You infidelic pagan scum.

In case you haven't noticed
There's festive things to do
So lets all rejoice for Jesus
And Merry fucking Christmas to you.

On Christmas day I travel `round the world and say,
Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists too,
Merry Fucking Christmas, To You!

Thank you Mr. hat",Merry Fucking Christmas,1999
Mr. Gentleman,"What absurd strategy is this?
Send down a handful of warriors
Let’s see if their blood is the same color as ours

Watch me appear on the field, my mission is to chill
I'n'I think 'bout the vibes and not about the dollar bill
I been busy on my rhymes, put some on a layaway
What makes me happy like Caribbean carnival on labour day
I love my mama, the hip hop shit we kick is thick
And if you trip you jealous motherfuckers get the dick
Now we kick in the door, you never heard it before,
Raw battle reports is what ambassadors stand for,
We're making rhymes not war, droppin' lines but don't sniff 'em,
I'm chillin' with my man Max and Sekou on the spliff an',
Reminisin' about the time the Phlow used to rock,
But '98 it's Mellowbag and Freundeskreis to tie the knot,
Blowin' the spot, what, makin' hip-hop what it is
First's supposed to be the fun then later comes the biz
That's what it is when we droppin' part two
It's undisputed rebel troops achieving victories for you
Yes for you and your people, queens and not the cheap ho's,
Commons not Deebos, true friends and not the fake bro's,
We're in it for the love what is dividing us from many,
Breaking through like Shaka Zulu for the heart and not the money

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down
The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
When you're under your meditation and look through

What is this, a game?
For the lack of a better word, general
We call it war

We kick that progress report consort to make it happen
Set up forts in foreign lands expand for everlasting
The fam span across the atlas like diasporas
Escape from out the grasp ot the most wickedest captors
Hear the laughter of the Czars in the dark like Nabokov
Rebellion coup d'etat, shit is raw, cut they heads off
Those who were lost floss now living lavish
Destination be the pastures of the city of Nazareth
Catalyst the revolution move the troops from out pollution
Mobutu citizens get the boot right in they asses
Ambassador status bring the loot back to the masses
Who live like hostages, the system be abusive like the music business is
We exist in the abyss but images be marvellous like novelists
Picture this like hieroglyphics on the fines papyrus
The world is ours but is devoured by the hour
Spread the scripture like Egyptians while the wicked spread the virus
Through the lies I realize the righteous bare my likeness
But they spite us so let the weak recite this
Sow my seed amongst the captives let the fleet complete the cipher

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down
The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
When you're under your meditation and look through

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down
The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
You could never ever out the fire we are walk through
What them wanna do now

Block the enemies shields
Hack holes in his plaque
And aim for the heart

Mr. Greenjeans,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.

It's a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I'm fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they'll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he's doing the same shit that I'm doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you're a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes'
Who can't keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it's only us

Mr. Hahn,"You know me
I used to get caught up in everyday life
Trying to make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tried to figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say
Nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it
This is what he said

Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst you'll see nobody cares
Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared

Now, I don't remember where I met him
Or remember his name
But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said seemed so right it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards, hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck

Because I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid
We're just under-appreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm saying, cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said

And I'm no hero
You remember how it was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything was going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles again
This is where you come in
All of this to explain to you why I had to
Separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around I'd just bring you down
And I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
And I know the way I left wasn't fair
I didn't wanna be around just to bring you down
I'm not a hero but don't think I didn't care",Slip Out the Back,2005

Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass

Mr. Hankey,"Howdy Ho!
The Virgin Mary was sleeping
When Angel Gabriel appeared.
He said, ""you are to be the virgin mother,""
And Mary thought that was weird.
[Mary said, ""I'm not a virgin
I blew a guy last year""]
But then, Gabriel said to Mary,
""My child, have no fear:

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still not be considered flawed.
[Though, Mary, you went to town,
and sucked some semen down,]
You're still still a virgin
In the eyes of god!""

There was no room at the Inn
When Mary and Joseph did arrive.
They were so very tired, you see,
[and Mary had to offer him a bribe.]
Said she had no money,
[and they had no place to sleep.]
Gabriel appeared to Mary,
And told her not to weep.

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be the mother of Christ.
If there's no room at the Inn,
then it's not considered a sin
[to suck a dick to get a room for free!""]

That's right

And three wisemen did appear
Bearing gifts of myrrh and such.
They said that they had followed a star,
And missed a woman's touch.
[Mary thought that she might pleasure them,
But could not take them to bed.]
But, again, Gabriel appeared to her
And this is what he said

[""You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
Everyone in the nation.
[Fellatio ain't no sin,
So go and blow those three wise men!]
And you'll still be a virgin,
['Cause there ain't no penetration!""]

[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary!
[The donkey, or the ox and the lamb]
And even the little drummer boy.
Folks will remember your name quick!
[They'll say, ""Damn, that bitch can suck a dick""!]
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.

Too many fish in the sea for me
But when the lights come on, and what's her name is gone
I realise where I'm supposed to be

Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Do you really want to live forever?

I be talking more shit

I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 

I still dream
I still dream

Oh no, I stubbed my toe
Crack comes the pain like a bullet
But at least it goes
Not like us
Happiness came and went; we had a little tear and now the tears are spent
We were trying to move forward love, but it's tricky through a brick wall love
What the fuck, are we doing love? 
How the hell do we move forward love?
Had you had a little drink?
Did you have a little think?
Did you have a little walk down the beach and have a think?
Ignorance was so much bliss thanks.
It was bliss but then came the kiss.
My boy drove me all the way home, he said
""Son, it's a situation.
Whatever you do,
There will be tears.""

[Chorus: x2]

I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream

It's why I just keep running
The quest for love was all that you and I held dear
With the beat still in your head
And a good book by your bed
We will survive

Someday, are we gonna wake up
A little bit older?
Are we out of time?
I know that, should we ever break up
We'll find a way to make up
In the fullness of time

Tell me where d'you wanna be
When all your friends have settled down
In the suburbs on the greener side of town?

""Good friends, well you can count them on one hand""
And they'll never judge you
Whatever your crime

I know that, I can include you
And you'll forgive me

Oh
I am the first son of Betsy and Edward Mensa
Made love and made a legend, Woodlawn and 47th
Gunshots outside my window, drug deals out by the Citgo
But mama always made sure the tooth fairy found my pillow
My pops was always workin', he put the family first
Chicago Saturdays in the park and Sundays at church
Kept me from off the corner where Stones and GDs was warrin'
And Kings and BDs and VLs all had dreams of bein' Jordan
Even dope fiends was scorin', swish, tryna be like Mike
Shootin' through that baseline in their veins tryna reach that height
I was a little rockstar, dressed up like Jimi Hendrix
In Hyde park in the good part in the hood like Kimmy engine
Teachers didn't see my vision, had me in IEPs
Kicked out of kindergarten, they didn't know that I was me
Tattooed my tears, wrote my story in my skin
Because even as a boy I always knew I'd be the man

In my dreams (in my dreams)
I saw it in my sleep (yeah)

At age 12 I learned the difference between white and black
Police pulled me off of my bike, I landed on my back
Back to reality, oops, a victim of gravity
Where they pull you down and keep you there
Dependin' on how you keep your hair
Now it's fuck 'em up and nothin' but NWA
Smokin' a 7 or an 8th, way before 7th grade
My classmates sellin' yay
Sebastian got me high that first time
In the back of an abandoned truck by Webster Place
Couldn't feel my face
Sprayin' paint to see my name on trains, try not to catch a case
Age 13 a crammed granny house, watchin' him shoot up the Ace
He took the needle out and waved it in my face
If I ain't tell that boy, ""Be easy, dog,"" I coulda died of AIDS
I started realizin' my talents 'bout the time I was 15
Tryna take over the world like Pinky and the Brain
Sellin' kush and hittin' stains, still in True Religion jeans
16, I was shinin' just like a Stanley Kubrick scene
Sneakin' into Lollapalooza, I fell off of that bridge
15,000 volts went through my elbow, fell over 30 feet
The doctor said I should be dead, still alive and still ain't scared
In the hospital bed, writin' these rhymes in my head

I'm dressed to kill with the glock and 38 on my waist line
And merkin you to me will translate to a great time
The guns that I hold oh man the money I mold
If I don't get it then you better bet the gun'll explode
The gun is aimin it your face you beater tear that shit up
Forget blastin your gut make sure your casket is shut
The black sheep of the bunch turning the weak into lunch
Yo I'm hungry for your flesh like I ain't eaten in months
Out to get with my axe and let it drag on your tan line
Put hands in the box and stab the handle with cat signs
I'll be in disguise ready to stick you with knives
And leave your arms gross like Forrest Whitekers eyes
Are you ready to die by this machette of mine?
It takes just one strive for your head to divide
Fuckin bludgeoned all night by my games of death
The cops'll struggle to find where your remains are left
They're underneath the weeds rotting in a gentle breeze
Chillin with the flies beetles and the centipedes
A distant memory your existence is gone
You're on your way to the gates where you'll be visiting God

[Chorus]
I'm on the prowl huntin for your head or your chest
Leavin you dead like the rest I got a fetish for death
I'm on the prowl son so you can run and evade
It's all the same in the end you got a date with my blade(2x)

It be the Children of Corn style the killa with sword I'll
Unleash a plague of bees upon a billion a sworn pile
Desolate drug supply the strength of my hug
But when I catch you you're strung up by the flesh of their tongues
Start avengin the script you'll be eventually ripped
Tossed in pendulum pits until you stench of the crip
You'll be hunted for days by thug with guns and grenades
Fuckin punchin your face until you're sunk in the grave
Blades are stuck in your brain laced and stuck in the lake
You should've ducked when I sprayed son you're a fuckin disgrace
Dirty legions on your grill plus excretions will be spilled
Gory missions will be filled must relieve before you're killed
My sinister inside drugged with hundreds of pills
It's a minister midnight better run to the hills
I'm leavin you diseased burning bullets get released
Earth is sure to hear you screech like guitars of Judas Priest
Next step you're check mated your vest is invaded
The hollow tip shells your chest is separated
Your caught up in a mess of tortured long death
From the depth more or less a corpse with torn flesh

 What honey? What's the matter?
I had a bad dream
About what sweety?
It's Mr. Hyde, Mr. Hyde is coming
[Little Britney]
Hyde Hyde Mr. Hyde everybody in the room has died {*4X*}

[Mr. Hyde]
Walking war minded with the echoes doused in blood
From stretching out your lungs mega penetrate my guns
So I keep 'em concealed I'll leave you leakin for real
The mother fuckin devil kid grim reaper with steel
Yo the sickos on reserve load the clip up with my word
I spit til you're disturbed verbs ticklin your nerves
Cock back the hammer in the center with gore shot
Foully droppin newborns on top of their soft spots
Quick vagina soars rippin out your spinal chords
You got gashes on your boards but you're dead like dinosaurs
Hand cuff you to the bed the drama's seeming sickening
Leave you faggots dead just like Jeffery Dahmer's victims
Pissin in your mouth you got an obscene smile
Your teeth are shinin yellow like that retard from Green Mile
Slice your wrists with the box cutter like this
Another sly bitch with the butterfly stitch
Born to hate your par so you catch a gapin scar
A wide open wound you can't close with staplers
Or a needle and thread this beat is leaving you dead
I blow a shot through the top now I can see through your head

[Little Britney]
Hyde Hyde Mr. Hyde everybody in the room has died {*4X*}

[Mr. Hyde]
My squad will bust through in herds bitch let me remind you
You're coughin your tonsils with my elephant shrapnel
Destined to stomp you stuff your face in the mud
Never waist no slugs that's why I pace with the jud
Guns will point at blank range I'm pointin pistols for brains
Put you splattered like paint your whole anatomy faints
Stuffed like Latter Day Saints that don't know how to be quaint
It's assault robbery or a battery rape
Peep the tragedy shake and the pin dropping silence
You shot with the 9 inch for stoppin the violence
Do you a slight favor before you're mortified
Cut you with the light saber and wound your quarter eyes
Ain't nowhere to hide from my gruesome legacy
It's hard to flea while you bleed cause you're losing energy
Foul like sexual harassin blast you with the mack 10
Violent homicide the intellectual assassin
Drill saws and tools fill the gore slaughter you
Drown you in a water pool now your breath bubbles rise
Trash troubles lies but see I'm the one who ends em
Deatha and disguise with the leatherface resemblance

I was missing from my christening
Chewing on my writing pen pursuing the enlightenment
To tighten nitwit game and lighten dim lit brains
The Rebirth, shit, I'm off the hook now
You see dirt through these terse, you will get shook pal
But look how children, be on some other shit
When the brother split, he coming back double grip
Bubble fit (Now) Bola (How?) Up off that cola
(Wow) Yo I done told ya (Blow) His life is over
Treachery is out to get with me, mental telepathy is saving me
I wear it like a badge of bravery, for safe haven see
Cause the grave in me calling me, but I ain't falling, G
They come in walls of three, I let 'em all have heat
I'm a let you know, check your testicles
Bet you're skeptical, with the letting go and wet you slow
And your ho, she gets some too, see your crew get run through
For you to undo, is like a llama learning kung fu
Drama's what I run you, mama's what you'll run to
I'm a go on and dump you and make you something to slum to
Chump you forgot to ask him, I got that platinum
Jump you, I bag and burn him, and bad ones learn from

And what you get, is no props, I'm blowing up your whole block
It don't stop, I'm on top of this going down
Nigga peep Ron flow, the lawn mower's mowing now
And nigga I'm about to cut your grass
Smash the gas, hit the block, adjust the mask and bust your ass
Fuck the past, focus on the present tense
With president and no paraphernalia or evidence
I'm heaven-sent but never repent so I won't make it back
But if I go tell, fuck it, I might as well take a strap
As I bail through hell's deepest dungeon
I plunge in the fire pit, to see if I die quick
Or if I get ressurrected and reincarnated
And when motherfuckers look to check, double are made it
Rappin' Ron, sending busters to trapping john
Blowing up so much shit niggas swore that I just got back from Nam
Bombs drop when Ron cocks nine glocks
And when the time's hot my nine pops non-stop
So nigga why not bust a shot and leave fools dead
Cause fool I got chops and glocks in my toolshed
Who said that you fled and Ron never stomped ya?
Nigga, I'm a monster, you know Ron can conquer
I'm the rawest flawless, Diddley Dog is the tallest
And I'm the shortest, but notice that I flow this
You're bogus, you can't get me, hit me or fuck with me
The shit be bumping, it's just me and Ant Diddley
Dumping, pumping, swelling fools' heads like a pumpkin

I slap bitches in the face and give em Jay-Z lips
Make them sign their life off so they can pay me chips
I cut hoes so much I should sell band aids
Give bitches sandwiches with handmade mayonnaise
I put bitches on the stroll hall
Plus I control hoes like remote control suped remote controlled cars
Code blow hoe on 'em like the internet
Got my dick in her neck and ain't even took her to dinner yet
Fuck that I ain't taken her to dinner
I'll bring her to a diner get behind and go up in her
You fuckin' with losers

With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke
Nah we on that dope

[Chorus: Mr. Kane]
In the world of change, here I am
Trying to have some things
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Oh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

Mr. Kayla,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

Not slip the bullet see and plus that you should be respected 
Never neglected gave you my all and all 
I bought your jewelry, nails hairdos and all your draws

You were sweeter than candy 
And had a pussy print that look like a midget man
Standin in your panties
Fine motherfucker thick thighs, boleggs

For slow sex and more head than asprin 
Lately huff'n and puff'n, bus'n nuts gaspin 
For air, grabbin your hair, you booted over
Never reachin the bed legs spread on the sofa
Gave you my time and money that's all I had

Yea I heard you was fuck'n and suck'n my boy Dennis
(sean let me explain) wait a minute let me finish
While I be at the job work'n bus'n my ass
You be sneak'n and creep'n the street fuck'n for cash

Now I wish I wouldn't even fucked wit you 
You can use the phone you better call Tyrone
Pack your shit and be gone when I come back home

Mr. Knightowl,"Check it out
First of all I would like to dedicate this song
To a very special and beautiful young lady
A lady whom in which I am in very love with
So from the bottom of my heart I speak
Only what I feel hoping that you will
Understand that there will never be another man
That'll love you the way that I do
You are my world and without life is not worth living
So please baby give me one more chance and I
The man that loves you will never let you down

Since nobody's weak like you
Baby though you know that I love you
You be the girl that I'm thinking about
Every muthafuckin' day
I can't get you out of my mind
I remember the day that I met you
The day that I saw you the very first time
I knew that I had to make you mine
So I started to walk where you was at
I asked for your name
You gave me your name and number
Now you're stuck inside my brain
'Cause all that I think about
Is how much I want to be your man
And spend my life with you my girl
Because I love you
We talk on the phone at night on a regular basis
But sill I haven't popped the question
Baby will you be my girl
I know that I'm the one for you
And you're the one for me just take my hand
I'll be your man together us two for eternity

[Chorus:]
I want to love you until the end of time
I want to make you mine baby don't go
You are the only one I think about everyday
I want to make you mine baby don't go
Say that you'll be my girl (say that you'll be my girl)
Say that you'll be my girl.


Nobody's ever been able to make me feel
The way you make me feel
This love is real I'll never put nobody else above you
Never did I think that a man like me
Would have a chance
But now that it's me and you I'm trapped
Inside of this romance
My world was lonely until the day
That you came along but now I am living life
With you, you are what keeps me strong
Without you life wouldn't be worth living
So don't leave my side
I hope someday you'll be able to say
That yes you'll be my bride
I've been in love with you for quite some time
And I feel so good that I got a woman like you
To love me when I need you hug me kiss me
Don't you stop
And tell me that I'm the one that you need
You are my world
So tell me baby that you want to be my girl

[Chorus:]

I know that I've done things in the past
But how long will this last
I said that I was sorry
Please forgive me just give me one more chance
My life without you ain't the same
I'm learning from my mistakes
And though these heart aches
You're putting me through I need you
Baby don't go I've always been true
I've never cheated
I've always been that man you wanted
Girl you're what I needed so give me your love
Come back I'm waiting for you the girl of my dreams
Oh how unreal it seems
When you're not here standing next to me
Remember the day you kissed me
The very first time I held you tight
When we made love that night
We both knew what we did was right
Cause we was both in love
And you're the only one I'm thinking about
I have no doubt it's you the one I love
Mireya, would you be my girl?

Mr. Knightowl,"[Young Sicc]
Oh yeah
Back up in the house for that Y2K shot
Young Sicc aka Frank Nitty
With my dog Knightowl
What's up dog
Keeping it real baby
You know what I'm saying
We're gonna show you fools how to represent
Represent that Dago style
Killer Cal style, baby

[Young Sicc]
Well it's that E-double S-E represent to the fullest
The mic is like a nine homeboy, don't make me pull this
Trigger if you figure that you can hang with us
Ese Sicc in the brain, click click, shoot 'em up shoot 'em up, bang bang
Be ready to throw them thangs and drop them bombs on ya
And this is how we do it in that Southern Killafornia
G's carry rags and represent your true colors
And if you ask me it feels good to be that Mexican brother
I handle my own and mind my own
But if you try to step you best believe it's going to be going down dog
Dropping bombs, stomping fools like King Kong
Take my steel-toes off your head and then I'm gone
So just recognize and watch your little step
Or be like American Me and catch that sharp shank to your neck
But I ain't trying to trip, just letting you know where I stand
Coming sick with this shit and representing Mexicans

[Chorus x2: Young Sicc]
Represent like it ain't no thang
Represent staying true to the game
Represent when we're out just hanging, banging, swanging
Represent that neighborhood gang

[Knightowl]
Better believe I represent reality, my street mentality
Will bring the pain, so don't get caught up in the game
The life I lead was not exactly what I chose
Hanging out on corner and drinking brew with winos
Smoking on the lala, the sound of fucking valas
Through the night up in the city where it's wicked, Dago where I kick it
G's all around me, mobbing through the county
Don't ever step and try and cross the line or you will find me
Got my boy Frank Nitty going off on your committee
You want to get brave, we'll give that ass an early grave
Little youngsters throwing up their shit
And ain't knowing I'm a G
I'm part of the reason shit goes down up in the SD
We represent this to the fullest, and I'm quick to pull a jale
Me vale madre, chinga tu madre
The loc'est of them all, I'm guaranteed to make you fall
Victim all up in the ghetto 'cause I wear the fucking metal baby

[Chorus x2]
[Young Sicc]
I represent everywhere I go and where I be at
Creased up Levis, Chuck Taylors and that San Diego hat
That grey pulled over sweater, Mexicans sticking together
Through tough situations, any kind of weather
Rolling in Impalas, Regals and Cadillacs
Homies got that San Diego tatted on their backs
And even on their arms, head and the chest
But this is how we do it on that wicked ass West
G's come out the pen, they're all sleeved up
So approach the wrong G and watch that ass get beat up
I'm only duece-one but got family that taught me well
And they got all kinds of stories to tell, laying low like a shell
Avoid sand getting kicked up in your face
You recognize or get put in your place
I always stay quiet and listen to what my family had to say
And thank 'em that I got to live to see another day

Forget about the people before I know tired of
Been through the whole world for what? Tired of bride
But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
Although they know, they won't ever get it right
'cause they got no class, and they have no game
And can't find another brother who boost it on pain
And hey hooray, on a one way give me

Walk into a party, come smart and laugh
As the girls go crazy, want me for my dear autograph
And it's me they be admirin, my new style of rappin
And brothers go around me, how I done the insanity
The girls say ""wow"" they can't spell the hate
Say fellas how you organize the word's today
On my will says ""chill"" and I do it by my way
'cause that's how we port son, represent, represent

Remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And outta nowhere some boys start a riot
Take off my clothes, I had to throw blows
The shotgun barrel and dead on my toes
The pros, it was people and the knows
Had a bunch of small timers, the people on my show
Surround it and bring it wit my empty shift
And said um, will you teach us how to rap, no doubt

Mr. Lee Gee,"Yea, from BK to the world. I've had enough

Now-a-days, the range ain't big enough
Moskino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out
But my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough
Label said its not enough, singing in the hook
I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay, so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't floss enough
And I still ain't lost enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough, about crack sales and jail
Yall feeling me like braill, well I still got no sales
Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was ""Born 2 Roll"", but they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine
And hoping that two-thousand-nine is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game is a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

[Chorus]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggaz got to know it's for real

Niggaz only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling you bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be, all in your stuff
Fuck around then come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggaz is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggaz ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, no one stresses
Project girls rock vesses, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire burn
Enough dough get made, not of it earned
Enough wildin', fuck that yo, enough smilin'
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough teks
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Chorus]

Enough if this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations set enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggaz on it
When we get in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggaz from the Brook', look
Enough cats with crack moes and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers, are lost entertainers
They found on billboards, greatest sale gainers
Enough beans and Benz, enough fly honies  with dime friends
That want to juice you for you ends
It's getting rough, a whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime though, like McGruff, enough's enough

Teaming with my accomplice who helped me on the Fat Shit

With multiple power-ups
My appetite for pain will eat a meteor shower up
Crash a thousand crews [Grab a bite] and get showered up

{Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]}
You feel refreshed
Now let's continue the quest
I use a towel to
Catch innards of those we disembowel for
Foul play [Lif what did Colin Powel say?]
Who knows? I had flood waters wash his ass away
He was just another rabble-rouser from Babel's tower
Living in the glorious realms of false power

{Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]}
I make you shake ya ass
I make you nod ya head
Plus give you the motivation
To get your ass out of bed

And eliminate the evil cause

Death to whoever tries to harm it
We'll demonize you
Provide adversity you'll never rise through
We upgrade to downsize you

Currency currently funding a holy war

And filling our TV's

Mr. Lif,"I'm the fire bearer
Holder of the sun
The Earth and the universe combined as one
An everlasting energy taking all forms
Blue skies on sunny days, terrible the storms
The one who tears down what you adorn
And curses the material things that you mourn
But look up in the sky 'cause I am the dawn
And the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
Strong, undeniably so
Lif better known as a society foe
The deity glow reach into my center
I bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
The tormenter, pleaser, embracer, squeezer
As your skeleton crush
Your physical turns into gelatin plus
Due to over stimuli
You liquify
I send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
When the ground splits
To swallow of corporations and cops
Give birth to rocks
So we can have solid ground on which to walk
Stand strong and talk
And write down theories in chalk on the side walk

Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell"" 
""The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes""

Around nine planets of forces
Ominous metaphorics in vision of devil corpses
Lying order, mad scientist slash author
Present the type of horror that boils your holy water
Get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
Hard boys become toys inside the real saga
So why bother
My whole flaw lines is harder
So bring the drama
We all know that science is smarter
I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek through souls when I walk past churches
Allah praise you, stay true to a devout purpose
Seeking out the wise wherever the God searches
Flows that I embark and leave your squadron shadow dodging
Lyrics assault men' like slugs that fill harkness
No option, narrow odds
Fucking with god is straight gambling with your tarot cards

Open the gates of Midian
For the fangs like the flesh
Three cyborgs who Bang like Ladesh
We hang the best
Spit venom until your face burn
Yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
The hate burn, scathe the urn of a Buddhist
Snake turn and fake yearns the kiss of Judas
We take lives with knives steady abusing ya
With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising ya with text of a Harvard class
Ikon will smash into shards of glass
To reform into a whirlwind of sand
Then reborn into the word Hologram
A solemn man with plans to entwine matter
Mind splatter from the grind of my divine hammer",Speech Cobras,2000
Mr. Lif,"Life, a new state of mind, new state of being
Constantly striving to understand what you're seeing
Finding the courage to stop fleeing
Problems that lie within
So this is where we begin
Self-esteem: something that's diminishing
Look upon the faces of the youth you'll see them withering
Societal pressures can be imprisoning
Look at the effects that they have on us all is rather vividly
How many women you know with eating disorders?
How much makeup on the faces of our pre-pubescent daughters?
Dudes are acting macho and they don't know why
A famous never-written motto is that ""boys should never cry""
Keep all those emotions bottled up, now what's up?
You can't communicate once you became an adult
Situations got brought 'cause you had lockjaw
Your kids ended up learning about life from a pop star
But I feel that rap is more real
Matter of fact this music's gotten me through many an ordeal
I was laying on a stretcher kicking rhymes by Eazy-E
After falling off my bike while holding food from Mickey D's
So I chilled, had to calm my mental state
Happy with the knowledge that the music helped me meditate
And while I'm healing waiting for this world to erupt
You can catch me sitting next to my crate pulling out cuts

""Pull out your cut"" (Rakim...scratched)

Yeah that's what I'm talking about right there
But yo kid, yo I was buggin, you remember ""Watch Me Now"" by Ultramagnetic?
Oh of course dog, my favorite joint though was Gang Starr
What's that joint? How's that joint go?
Wait, yo I think I remember yo

I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
I said I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
The Guru, he's been my idol for years
Ripping shit with Premier, making the be	-boys cheer
And the GZA, Investigative Reports
He, Ghost' and Raekwon, they didn't take no shorts
Plus the are, 'cause that's the way that it has to be
These brothers redefined lyrical mastery
And I could go on cold pulling cuts for days
But I got something to say about you rappers today
Your rhymes drop in weak spurts so you bite 'til your teeth hurt
But I'm your dentist so meet my apprentice
Chucky, and Charlie Bronson from Death Wish
I couldn't hoard all of these medical skills and be selfish
It's hard to say rhymes with no incisors or canines
I kill all the weak minds, administer brain????????
'Cause I'm the type of kid that's on the positive tip
But that's because I suppress my urges to slaughter you quick
But this time I just can't fight the feeling
That's why I'm smiling as your small intestines dangle from the ceiling

Ears crippled by the pain and negligence so was the tendency

Yeh it's just you and momma now
Stop the cryin' now, just try to smile now
Try to think of other things now

Here's how it goes, she's off to school an' dancin' on her toes
At an hour long ballet class then on to the piano
Two hours of repetition, emulatin' class with music compositions
Do your homework with precision
By nine-o-clock she collapses in a heat of dizziness
But sleep so tomorrow you'll repeat ya business
She got straight A's a stroke of her stress
Throughout her maydays but drawn up out the melees
Her mom and dad tryna blame each other different ways she stop and gaze
Thinkin' how it drives her crazy when their voices raised
This the web that ruins most of her days
From her perfection was expected
An exec that workin' hard without receivin' any raise
At night she cries when she lays
Then she wakes up, washes up smiles and goes along like it's okay
On to high school, there's more intensity within her cycle
She's makin' all the guys drool
Here comes the extra tight rules
No late, not with college on the plate
Practice hard, study hard stay in focus keep ya head straight
Now she's a nervouse wreck, lookin' to collect
Anything that she can smoke swallow drink or inject
When she was mentally gone she went to the prom
Had dates and actually could sit down
Discuss relationships with her mom
But tell me how much pressure can a person take
Before they break and maybe crush this on a large enough escape
So one night she turned in but stayed up late
At her desk with a single piece of paper and a papermate
Here's mom a federal team waked at daybreak
What she saw made her knees shake the death of dear Kate
The note said here's the future of your fuckin' perfect child
Please be proud I'm livin' for the now
Do your work, clean your room now
Take the makeup off your face now
Eat your dinner now, get off the phone now
Leave the boys alone now
Saturday night, you stayin' home now
Go to your room and sit alone now
Katie with the needle how
Look baby momma needs you now

This is the last chapter
Bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh my god, oh dear
I was hmm.. I think I was *h* movin somewhere
About to paint my fear bright glare not quite clear
Stay blinded to the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
On how they started thinking wishfully
Guided by fear I'm suddenly aware
Please, is anybody out there?

It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh a terrain
And now my name is merely left
Suckin on brain exist before the final flash
The emotion of pretty details of a life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
Hopeless liquor with a

Convert to atheism denounce god pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blades to erase my spirit
Death - faced with it - run to it - not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of 151 hung mommy
Head outside the smashed windows in trash my hotel lobby
Break the grip off the time at last
I find I get to him up Wish I did more sinnin
Get a strap on run up in two women
Laid in the middle of a highway wait for pain to hit me
Still a can with people lootin screamin come and get me
Finally it was porn shop biggest gun crowded street
Blow my brains to hell - I'm gone - and let the devil come for me

What's the chance that I'd be one of the last ones left of my preceders
The Earth Crusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people the lies instead of acting like defeatists
But what good is that? Cause we're now all goin to hell
Like some kid playin in his class out talkin before the bell
I died believing in righteousness but I could have indulged more
Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they matched up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me because they all comin with me

Our horizon was accessorizing we bred more need
Best believe this be the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new breaks
Another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine we made more food
Food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all?
Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin the patriots win the super bowl
Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole
Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul
I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for
Every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been at more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters
I coulda read more
Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for
And its ill, its power to the form of a bill
To which people killed by manipulated free will
Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love I hated to leave you alone
Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem
Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying
Now we're all ground by the grind
Out of luck and out of line, out of signs
And now we're out of time...",Post Mortem,2002

This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

I got a job at a business place I chose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick? Yes you may
Back when I was  compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value way back then, but boy it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
And you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
Of a sniper's shaky scared, shot off your ear
All fucked up down, one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pop
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
It's a soldier's suicide slide know you tried hard to stay alive
When you're catching fire from both sides
And we miss you at home, it's time the government truly left you alone
Dropped you off and popped one in your dome

That I'd be dodging bullets, seekin' weapons that never even existed

While the Commander-in-Chief, would never come to fight himself
I feel I'm bein' tricked even worse that the civilians
Nobody ever told me that we would be killin' children
Feelin' like the ones that sent me here are the psychotics
But if I say that out loud, I'm ""unpatriotic""
But would Donald Rumsfeld back me up with the chrome?
Would Tom Ridge fight or would he stay secure back home?
And would Condoleeza Rice cover grenades in a fox hole?
I'm startin' to believe what I was told is not so
What's the reason for the war?
I'm shootin' at these people that I got not animosity for
I wonder if I'm just a pawn in someone else's struggle
Or a here even though I'm just a small piece of the puzzle
I know that when I finally return where I reside
I'll make up for the months my wife and moms cried
And carry on for all my fallen brothers who died

Lets talk about sex let's talk about reps
Talk about lust and talk about trust talk about death 
And talk about lies talk about truth and talk about life 
I know soon I go see me come back with about 10 crows 
So I make it all simple you, you and the world a nickel 
Sicko status who be the baddest motherfucker 
Watch when I buck you all of this arson all of this fire 
You be the G liar, liar quiet hums then I come 
Who who Mr. Lil One evilish ways devilish style 
Selfish pitiful greedy times

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone
Hear these sick thoughts going through my dome
Voices playing with my head 
Some times I wish I was dead

Lets talk about day talk about night talk about wrong 
And talk about right talk about truth talk about faith
Talk about you and talk about snakes wait till the grand finale 
Now Lil One blowing up in Cali had it bag it feeling the fans
Everybody knows I'm the man crystal clear how you fear
Me Lil One every time I'm near, beer I love it ghost I love them
And what about hoes I think nothing of them
Enemies run damage is done why why they fin to get done
Satanical sign dramatical times all 'cause I'm sick in the mind

[Chorus]

Lets talk about you talk about me talk about us 
And talk about greed Talk about hoes and talk about sluts 
Talk about girls and talk about mutts, why must I feel this way? 
All this pain every single day Moms is gone music is lost
Still I feel all of this wrong all this hate all this drama 
All of this hate from my baby momma
Making up lies family ties shred it poke and sitting here coping
Frown on my face hope that she taste 
Some of this shit when it blows in her face

Mr. Lil One," 

[Mr. Lil One]
I show up in the room, wit a witch and a broom
Mothafuckas know how I do it when I show
Blowin up houses showin up like mouses
Leavin fuckin holes in wall til they fall
Callin up the 5-0 snitchin on the wyno
You don't want to fuck wit these mothafuckas I know
Gasoline matches sleepin in the matress
Give your bitch your matches, boom you're ashes
Sleepin in the gutter, what about your service
Nobodys around him, they say I make em nervous
Run for eternal, salute me like a Cornnel
Never could escape all the flames from the lake
Now you got a widow, broke without a nickle
Askin me Little, can you be my sicko
Burnin up my bridges, make your turn religious
Tell my nigga Easy to holla when he sees me

[Chorus]
I have a feelin, I think it's gonna mean
A whole lot of killin, when you fuckin wit me
You have a feelin, think you better run
Tell me who the villain, Mr. Lil One
[2x]

[Mr. Lil One]
I went up in your pad, on your mother and your dad
Had to tie em up, had a nigga fired up
I think I need a change, I've been chillin in the range
Time to loosin up, grab my shit and juice em up
Fuckin wit the ghetto, we got a score to settle
When ever we face, but your pedal to the medal
Pray for your life, I'm like O.J. wit a knife
I beat it cause I cheated, bitch I'm undefeated
66 and 0, and got 6 to go
Lick up on the dick when I pick another hoe
Show no remoarse, ofcourse you're a corpse
When ever we bump in the forest like Gump
See me in the Omen, beenie on my dome and
Since I was a child, drivin mothafuckas wild
Obsessive, possesive, and never have I rested
Demon in my soul, now won't you come and test it

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lil One]
Cat behind my back, grab your gat it's all good
Eventually it'll get to me, creep up in your hood
Danger I'ma stranger, dress up like a homeless
Activate dissaster, find your body domeless
From the neck down, what went down
Thought about your homies, I think they let your down
That's insecurities fuckin wit maturity
Thought about a foe, sick then it occurred to me
He heard of me, he chose to be a starter
Fatal your mistake, never take me from my daughter
Use your imagination, premeditation
Execute you mother and your whole generation
Give you all the chills, make you pop pills
Piss up on your jeans, see me in your dreams
Prepared to be, scared of me, Satan can't compare to me
Come to my legacy, my daughters right next to me

[Mr. Lil One]
Well I'm Lil One I got bitches galore
You may have a lot bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper hit's and my chin check tips
Dick between the tits and I'm aimin at the lips
Chips by the dozens and I might when of your cousins
Even know your sister, she tried to give me blisters
Now she goes around tellin people that I kissed her
Mr. Lil One be the one wit the women
Swimmin in em, but I know about the venom
I send em on their way, right away when they play
Let me tell you about this bitch I met the other day
Walkin down the block, and we parked and we talked
Came over my house, she was bobbin on the cock
Isn't that a shame, I got a little fame
I'm all up in your girl and I don't even know her name
Damn what a hassle, I'm an asshole

[Mad One]
Stumblin, wobblin out the cantina
That's when I seen her, nasty cochina
Met her through her prima
Quick to approach, puffin on a roach
Blowin smoke, baby wants to choke
Broke lil ass, had a cash
Straight to the point, left lipstick on my joint
Started askin questions, What I've been up to?
Still makin the music that you ride and bump to
Professional hooker that strips for the chips
Pierced nipples and clit, likes to play wit the whips
Exotic, erotic, you want it you call it
But watch your play boy cause she's out for the wallet
Ready for the smackdown, pornos in the background
Hi-jack a pussy, slap her, known to be a nut cracker
And if you at there payin, she straight up playin
The role of a spouse but never at the house

[Chorus]
[Siccmade]
We gotcha feelin the funk from your neck to your feet
High Diego shit make you get out your seat
You know what time it is every time you see me
All the freaks in the front always beggin for a piece
Of this spicy young thug, all out for the blood
But you won't see that Siccmade fightin in the club
I got to much love for them cats out there
And them hoochies and hoodrats with no underwear
You can stare if you wish, caution is blindin
You look so surprised, to see that Siccness rhymin
Good timin, Goodfellas, we know how to rock-a-fella
Infamous lyricist gotcha reachin like Helen Keller
Turn that shit up, Sicc and Lil One is gotta bump
Platinum bound Sickos via satellite, now what
Across the gloe we go, into new deminsions
Third world countries, Caribbean, big pimpin

[Frost]
Now the party don't start til I walk in
And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
So in the mean time, and in between times
If you work your shit, I'll work mine
Man we came here together so we could have fun
Frost, Malo Uno, Sicc and Lil One
The Latin Kings, ready to do big things
Like some big time West Coast rap machines
I'ma give you what I got and baby that's plenty
Gon, make it crack, baby back at the telly
Gonna make you wet, gon make you sweat
Just to see how nasty you can get
Chill on the set wit a glass of moet
And if you can't back up what you say
Then you ain't shit
Yeah, ain't no actin, play time's over
I'm drunk and bizzin and puffin on doja

[Chorus]",Let's Ride,2001
Mr. Lil One,"Yeah, you know how we do
Lil Uno, and I brought my homie 
Sicc Made
We're gonna break down
To all the bitches
And all the hoes
Here we go

I got plenty of hoes
Freaky little 20 year olds
Centerfolds, callin' on the cellular phone
They pluck, hook it up and get freaky
It's all good girl, where you want to meet me
She said night life, and bring pornos
Bring your home boys, I got my home girls
Want to fuck all night and get nasty
Lil One can you please come and spank me
That's affirmative, ten four
Let me come and do you like a nickelbag whore
I love the way you moan every time that we bone
I love the dirty thoughts that you put ip in my dome
I love the way you wiggle every time I'm in the middle
I love the way you fuck when you're fuckin' wit the Little
I love the way you keep it on the lo lo
And never let a mothafucka know know

Baby can you suck on my big stick
I love the way you lick on your lips
I love the way you move when you strip [Repeat: 2X]

Well it's that lowridin'
Young thug Sicc Made
It's a trip man
So many hoes to get play
Mr. Lil put me up on the game
So it's mine time to shine 
For the fortune and fame
And trust me when I shine
Cause I'm always gonna glisten
Wreckin' mics in my pad
Spittin' out some playalistic
Bitches, I ain't givin' up no shorts and no losses
Collectin' my cheddar, organize like crime bosses
Your lose is my gain and I still maintain
Got to dykes in the back takin' two dicks to the brain
Sounds insane, my thought is that you dispise
Most of the time I'm too high to realize
How trifflin' this hoes be
Actin' like they knows me
Bitch don't know shit 
Except a smack from the n-you-t
So to say but that's the way it is
In that Diego, California, biatch

[Chorus]

I remember a day
Saturday, TJ
You were all up on a mothafuckin' Ese
Wigglin' your ass every time that I passed
Givin me some look, like some dick up in your ass
Dance wit the Devil, the level's outrageous
When my niggas slip and my dawg Macadascious
Don't act like you don't know
'Cause me and you both, know you're a hoe
So I remain insane
Better watch your mouth when it comes to my name
Game's for the players, but I be a coach
Every where I go bitches givin' up the chonch
Askin' me Lil' can you come across me
Just like Slide, can you fondle me and floss me
Double cross me, hang, dead
Keep up on your knees and play wit my head

[Chorus: ]",Lipstick,2001
Mr. Lil One," 

(Verse 1)
It could be the right time
middle of the night time.
Sip a little wine for the stress in tha mind.
Show you how I make mine,
Nobody could take mine.
Heard it through the grapevine,
but it really ain't mine.
Never really was every time I get a buzz.
Shoot it to tha left like a real ?g? does.
Yeah just say no but ain't got a halo.
All I gotta do is lay low from the po-po.
Listen to the cholo, blowin up solo.
Holla at a playa we could hook up at the mo-mo.
Chill at the Ramada, do whatever you want to,
Do whatever we gotta and never say nada.
Now you want to sex me? Girl you want to test me?
Girl you better know the whole world respects me.
Come by the fire, chill with a player.
How you admire these words that'll save ya.

(Chorusx2)

Stay with me, never leave
Stay with me, help me breathe
Stay with me help me be, help me be the best of a man that I can be

(Verse 2)
Now the moods getting righteous, baby don't fight this.
Move it like that, yeah I like this.
What about 4-play? Beat it up all day.
Will I still love you in the morning? Always.
Show you what I mean every time that I speak this.
You know what I mean girl; you know how to treat this.
Never be the one to put the lil in the mix.
You and me alone in the night? Shit.
Climaxin, body bakin, makin me high like Toni braxton.
Askin questions will I ever mention any lil secret?
I promise that I?ll keep it.
Just go along with your cardio.
Just bring yourself and the bacardi on.
The rest is fine just keep the faith
just you and me that's all it takes.

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 3)
Now I feel the pressure think I'm gonna measure
Every lil thing that we done to the bone.
Break it on down when it?s me and you alone.
Now it?s getting drastic every body askin
Is it really true? You my lil lady?
What you really think I?ma tell em? lately?
Tell em how I really feel about the deally
Tell em how I really feal about the kiddy.
What about tomorrow got about one time
Never give away what's mine right?
Most of these knickle be	?s
tryin to play a game with g?s.
and that be the difference for instance
ever since this affair we?re both aware.
It?s me and you and you and me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

Seen you around meant your man was in the county
Set to serve a bid now I'm headin to where you live
I got me a posse forget you or not
Maybe we could talk and exchange our iner thoughts
Knowin one another but keep it undercover
I got to keep a secret if I want to be your lover
Now keep it on the down low, nobody knows
Sippin on my beer as you're whisperin in my ear
Tellin me your real and that you want to feel
Like you would ever leave me, descive me, believe me
Never have I trusted a women that I lusted
Now were always screwin and nobody could ruin it

Now I hold a grudge from the colors that you show me

I got scopes that are deadly like strokes when I roll by
Everybody sayin hi, I'm not knowin why
All up in the mix and still triple sixen

Kinda like Ruch Banis I got the fame
I'm young and bad and I'ma blow up like his plane
It gets kinda a critical when I get lyrical
Words that I speak got your fiendin like tweak
Show em no pity down to the grity
Kinda like when Jesus got jumped by a whole city
It gets scary so watch who you marry
She might be the first one to laugh when you're buried
Take you for your goods all alone in the woods
Sufferin lonely what about your homies
Everybodies fake so watch who you trust
The girl that you love is the girl that I lust
Watch as I take her, show you she's a faka
Go ahead baby shake your money maker

I creep and I crawl
I shoot and make em fall
I'm posted on your walls
Now who you gonna call
It's me and my dawg through the fog breakin laws
2 bald headed thugs with the slugs for the cause
Pause, hold up, wait up, and give me an minute
Remember it was you and only you all up in it
But all of a sudden, your mind went through changes [changes]
Never talk to strangers [strangers]
You should of told her, beggin me to hold her
Look over your shoulder Hi it's me

Dear god, forgive me for my sins, i've been trippin
I made promises to you about my drinkin
About my kids, and the way that I've been thinkin
Sometimes I feel like my world is slowly sinkin
I need a bottle to relax me and calm me
All that bottle ever did was really harm me
But should I call me, I'm speakin hypocritical
I got alcohol in me and gettin lyrical
I feel you in my presence on a daily
And I'm grateful that you gave me healthy babies
But not to shy away, I'm hurtin for a reason
I apologize, I'm sorry for the teasin
And I pray you don't forget me and protect me
I don't blame me if you don't like or respect me
But you know me like nobody else
Please forgive me, don't leave me by myself

Keep me strong through my rights and my wrongs

I remember a couple months back, how I pleaded to you
I remember every word and I'll repeat it to you
Get me outta this, I'm in a jail cell
And if I let you down, send my soul to hell
Well I did, and I deserve for you to leave me
I'm speakin on the truth, and I hope that you believe me
Pleaded for my freedom, I put that on this earth
Don't want to miss my little baby girl's birth
And you let me walk away and kept me happy
And kept the faith that nothing would distract me
Keep my word, do whatever not to break it
Keep it real right? I'd never thought I'd fake it
Not with you, but I did, I feel broken
Will you accept me with your arms wide open?
I hope you feel my pain and my repent
I hope you get this little message that I sent

At your gave for trying to act brave, you could of stayed

I gave you all my testimony, you're a fraud you's a fake
And forever be a fony, now throw away your fantasy
That you were me, but never could it be, because I'm bigger then the sea
I saw ya coming, I was walking you were running,
And all of a sudden I was pointin' and blastin', at you
I was taking away every day that you lived, and I never forgive
Unforgiven, psycho way I was driven with the evils how I'm livin'
6 letters in my name, 6 thoughts up in my brain, 6 shots from my slug
Gotcha wakin' up in a frame, a memory of you but it's all because of me
Till you paid for your sins is the day I set you free

I'ma defeat em' ain't no one to lead em' anywhere I feel
Still I gotta be the man of rhymes when I'm in your minds friends full of lies
When you gotta a whole lot of ends then you got a whole lot of them friends
But you gotta be the one to know when they want to come put a Lil show
So I give em' all a big smile write em' up put em' all up in a file
and I send em' on their way as they all say

(Chorus 4X)

(Verse 2)
Now before I get up in the mix let me run em' all down how I get down
I be one of a kind every mankind will you find of mine
That so sick like a berreta that I never let another get ahead of me
I be all up in your thoughts feel the gun shots now your full of blood clots
Any one that'll feel against this suspense well your fin to rest for a long time
Never drop a dime not a good sign when your in a pine box
And all want to reminisce you all the girls want to come and kiss you good bye in the lips
Why wait till your dead all in the mix if you never have then you never should
'cause I never would even though I could. Still I had to give em' all a diss
And I insist that you never risk any one with a right mind 'cause you might find that
Your really no good then screw ya went through ya now do ya feel the voodoo
Goin all up in your veins ain't that a shame
now you really feel the pain and there's no one there for you to lean on
now you gotta go and get your fiend on
And know I be the one baller lil one can I get a dollar?
Hell no first I gotta hear you holler

(Chorus 4X)

(Verse 3)
Now never could I be the one that'll run rather over come
Any class of a man now I gotta ban anyone
that'll stand in my way only one way
that I'll ever pay that's your death
As you know this rigormortis by the man named in the chorus
I gotta be the baddest of them all never will you find even a little flaw
This locness and dopeness leavin all my nemesis hopeless
And never find a man that'll make any man have a doubt what he's all about
Take him on a route with the grim reaper
So why would you want to diss?
Now I gotta leave you in a bloody mess
Any body else that'll run around
dig em' in the ground
find em' all spellbound
And get em and I'm gonna wet em
bloodshed oh never will I ever let em
Escape me elevate me said you hate me
but you can't take me
See lil one be the baddest
well mad man be the maddest
and we got em all up in the mix
Everybody want to come and get a glimpse
of them locs with a sick mind 619 right around time

And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving

But by the time the first bombs fell we were already bored
We were
Already
Already
Bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling, again

But in my dreams we're still screamin and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally Fall
Nothin' at all
It meant nothin'

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling, and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
Show her some beauty, before the damage is done
But if it's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot I'm still waiting
It's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's Already past
Already past

Don't give a fuck when you dead and gone
Motherfucker you feel my bucks from my chrome

[Chorus]
Ugh! Back up off me, feel me, ugh
Feel it, back up off me, my trademark
Ugh, feel it back up off me, ugh

Gon' pack me with a nigga with no bread
Nappy head, put chu' in a grave
Don't give a fuck about chu' niggas, piss on ya forehead
I'm from that Southside, we kill with that cut rock
But niggas they slangin' that hoo rock
But niggas they want to boo dock, that Buddha
Nigga a quarter, of water
But y'all niggas late 'cause I done took over New Orleans
In the Southside to the Westside to the Eastside to the Northside
Motherfuckers never realize the young gon' die on the streets
I'm killin' murder, the lunatic
Never givin' a fuck, I'm tryin' to make bucks
Before I leave this truck
Got these killers watchin' me
Niggas not pockin' me
V got that tech nine and Man got that Uzi
Big Boz come with rah rah, niggas with sah sah
KR hooked up the track so what the fuck y'all didn't realize
We back to takin' the battle, scattle not rattle
Get my tic tac and make ya motherfuckin' head rattle
Like an ostrich, nigga you want some sausage
Meet me in the French Quarter
I'm kickin' it with them 3rd ward hustlers
And they bout it, niggas we rowdy
Never givin' a fuck, we started this bout it, bout it
Now why y'all sayin' y'all bout it bout it
Y'all scared of me, yeah y'all scared of me
Bitch talkin' shit, you and ya bitch I ain't afraid of ya
I'm hustlin' got them ballers, niggas we smokin' them quarters
Fiends be dippin' that water but we hustlin' like it ain't no tomorrow

[Chorus]

Niggas comin' wicked, fools I'm gon' kick it
Be whippin' niggas ass like I'm cookin' greasy chicken
I'll pop off batter but niggas they want to scatter
Niggas they talkin' shit, I be runnin' with them 17 round automatics
Up the trees, watch them niggas freeze
Don't give a fuck, take off my shirt nigga
No Limit on my back, back
But niggas they pullin' that sack, sack
TRU against my stomach motherfucker how y'all gonna fade that
The real fuckin' click, ain't no love for y'all dubs
Niggas think we slangin' dubs
Nigga we slangin' tapes to you niggas across the world
Niggas that squirrel, I got that girl
My lil' partner got boy, got the whirl
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I be sick like Suzy
Take these 32 round clips from my automatic uzi
Run and duck nigga you fried
Ain't no love where I'm from, from the outside to the inside
The projects from uptown to downtown
To across the river
Niggas slangin' that dope motherfucker get cho' head twisted
In the river, you gone, ain't no love meet the chrome
I be in the project ballin' like the black Al Capone
And if you come sick you stupid
'Cause my click don't give a fuck cause they ready to shoot shit
Up but nigga you better duck nigga
Before you find your body floatin' up the Mississippi River

Mr. Man,"The highest caliber make it a night to remember like Shalamar
Then escape to Havana with Assata I do what I gotta
Planes get shot down in Cuban air space over the water
I got insight it's a clear case of reading your aura
Man what you got for us as my Black men stand in line like a chorus
Makin' these MC's our sons like Horus
I'm always taking shots like a Japanese tourist, get the picture?
Flyer than Keyser Soze and no exposure

I'm sippin' wishing well water imported from Pluto
That's why my eyes is glassy, so ain't got to ask me
The interplanetary Illuminati move your body
I trekked the stars first, so fuck Kirk and Scotty
I threw basement parties on the Mothership
Now I'm on planet Earth on some other shit
Many 'habitants of this world be strivin and struggling
Tryin to eat food and keep the rights to they publishing, huh
Ghetto red hot, man that shit is like bubbling
Can't get no peace 'cause the Beast keep troubling
Youth, they oppose and the blows they be doubling
Nike heads is trife and the shots, they be thundering
Ways and customs don't make any sense
They be givin' me stress and they test my maintenance
Use the sand and the Ummah as my sustenance
No, this style will never lack, melanin's my evidence

In order to effective, with your words you must be selective
'Cause showin' and provin' is the Prime Directive
Movin those who are outdated with vernaculated thought, so
Every time I take a turn MC's take a loss
My point across, I gotta get to where I want to be
As the wickedest public speaker since '73
Or '74, which was the year I first touched ground
As the physical manifestation of sight and sound
So gather 'round, to hear the profound brown vomiter
Absorb the sonic energy manifestin' through your monitor
The livin proof, I make the truth sound clear
Mr. Man, in nine ether represent right here, check it out

This once in a lifetime like a Halley's comet
Yo, we bring it to Medina like the prophet Mohammed
Peace be upon he, and, we MC's
Speak the fortified live exhibit level degree

Yo, we bring it to Medina like the prophet Muhammad
Peace be upon he, and, we MC's
Speak the fortified live exhibit level degree

Yo, what's wrong with this picture? Don't it seem bugged
MC's is high on they supply, sounds like they takin' drugs
Y'all trippin' like mescalin and killin' the feeling like penicillin
Switchin' to Lionel Rich' and dancin' on the ceilin'
Go ahead and be a heroin, your own mind
Fuck your internet, coke is it when you on line
Smokin dirty weed, ignorin' the medicinal herbals
So we in your ass like you was Richard Gere or we was gerbils
You get stepped on like crack vials by ghetto children, plus
Swept under the rug, we turnin' niggas into dust
You done came out of the earth, what your life worth?
When you get left with what you had on the day of your birth

Ha, yo, it's the super scientifical, high-powered prolifical
Lyrically a miracle, mentally I'm physical
Massively I'm critical, verbally invincible
These kids wanna battle but the material's pitiful
The only original, wicked individual
Whenever I rhyme, I break it down into syllables
Simply because it's coming straight out of Brooklyn
It sounds so out of sight I got the blind people lookin'
It's Mr. Man the act, boy what? You get stolen
I'll cut your ass in half and leave you with a semicolon

We cold-crushin' MCs that's gold-rushin' for the cheese
They see a flash in the pan waitin' for royalties

But kings and queens get overthrown when they grab the microphone
Shootin' videos in homes that they know they'll never own
I guess they cannot work alone, they forever with crew
L sparking, steady barking 'bout the wildness they do
Posin' in photographs shot at complimentary angles
Be playin Mr. Tuffy when they feminine like bangles
Practices is fraudulent, fallacies record to tape
Step in my zone, your spot'll get blown like Watergate

Wait, my blastin' rate is past a state of rappers who procrastinate
Mr. Man is great, so every time I rhyme, I fascinate
Masses hate to have to wait for me to unload
So I flip into my mode and rhyme long like a road
See, I drop the greats like clumsy waiters drop plates
I got rhymes by the crates to erase the duplicates
'Cause, I blow wack rappers out like afros
My shit is so phat it be stretchin' my asshole
But huh, that's not the point because I'm better than most
I make MCs wonder like bread but then, bread gets toast
It's like that, Mr. Man, Mos Def, and Kweli
Represent for every single real MC, you don't stop
(Yo, yo, yo, this is the mighty Mos Def)

No money for books so every day I'm livin' mad
Born to be tough through all these miseries and pain
Standin' strong through these struggles of this deadly game
Visions of body bags and my homies closed caskets
Illusions of prison and pistols pressures that I blastin'
I'm out to live with no time to play
I got the tendencies to kill in relentless ways
Straight up, cause life is a trick bitch, if you weep and reek
You stuck outta luck, seekin' for relief
Too much destruction, they claim we gotta make a change
So much trouble between each other cause ya ghetto life is strange

Philosophically, psychologically ya fixin' to be fucked
We goin' on this ride and ya bitch I'm gon' seduct

Ask the mound killer
Faces I remember they say dump him in the river
New Year's Eve 1999 nigga
Virtual reality, galaxy gettin' slicker
Me and Crime Boss and a nigga named Mister
Mike to a flight, had some glitz to deliver
Headed back to the Suave castle
I had to wrestle with this transvestite who had a dick like a lasso
In this castle was a midget with banana clippin'
Bootleg sniffin' or Mr. Mike'll fuckin' wicked
Ways infared waves hit his fuckin' chest
Blew his ass to bits, particles of green shit

Been hypmotized since '85 with gansta shit
All you niggas get live and represent my click
Got bits and pieces on my mind commin' together like lettuce
Dear God protect us, cause we're mobbin' like Good Fellas
Alias Carlion, maybe the war is on
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain
Chillin' with millionares, ex-killers, and set-trippers
My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha
Slip ya worse than New Jersey Drive niggas
Cause I'm in a 
Rush to bust straps like mack-10's
When I'm strapped in
A '95 Impala
Breakin' like Vegas for my dolla
While I'm commin' like a hundred miles and gunnin' who gonna test

Women with gaps
Now they want to' sit in my laps and listen to raps
But no
Heard a nigga' tight named Mr. Mike
Had to catch a flight, its only right
Stepped of the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper
Killa was the caper

See we can't get enough of this gansta' shit
Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta' click
Lets take riches
Witness two niggas' dome in the killa' zone
Bring your killa' chrome

Some niggas' never make it home

And then I want ya'll to kill cousin's and all (Ha,Ha,Ha)

Of the dyin'
Keepin' it calm, so talk slow
Cause you'll never know

I'm a pro of the lifestyle of the Bloods and Crips

My ghetto niggas survive and hold hands, we live
And old men embedded the game and aim 4-5's
And blindsided females, we mesmerize them
See, hell, we're live men, broke as fuck, no lyin
So what's up? I make a whole city get em up
And I know white folks is racist, cousin, I don't really give a fuck
Patience, don't be sayin that, sling the dopest rhymes like crack
Take a look around you, all your boys is layin on they back
Makin noise and bangin tracks, trained to kill on contact
Can't nobody hold me back, hate me or give up some dap
Take me somewhere off the map, gee, tell us where the party at
Show respect and then reject, the fellas don't know how to act
Blaze a sack of bombay, can we do it all way?
In school I was a fool, catch me screwin in the hallway
Ball all day, if I ever fall, it's on my knees to pray
Jesus bless my soul, needin dough I sold a ki of lley
Hopin it won't end this way, runnin from the D.E.A.
When they come investigate, you better have your story straight
Ain't nothin poppin bout no broke nigga, black nigga
Fuck what they say, and get your dough, nigga, scratch, nigga

A trip, back to kick dust, nigga what?
Cussed my teacher out, got expelled, bailed to the weed house
Hell, don't underestimate me or doubt me, I'm great
And highly educated, bitch, all about my papes
But in the States down MC's can't's see me, straight from the underground
Niggas can't bring me down, that's why they start to hate me now
Escapin town and do all my dirt all by my lonely
They actin wild, it hurts, don't run up on me

The game's deep, now can you see us, me and Mack One-o?
To hell where some go, a don that's velcro
We bail and bomb while some fail to turn pro
So act like you know, hey hoe, best not doubt me
Niggas don't mob without me, ain't nothin fraud about me
Time tickin, mind spinnin, can you dig these wicked rhymes?
Gettin live, what's the deal with his eyes? Devil I despise
Sniff em out like bloodhounds, lyrically puttin my thug down
Seriously, why'all can hunch now, spiritually we been drugged down
I'm your host now, who's the boss? Niggas get lost and broke down 
Crossed with golden crowns, then you hear me more than now

I went without a million days before I came out

I'm out of dope, it's a drought the whole hood is concerned
I gotta take what I want, I never learned how to earn
I pull my heat out and squeeze, yelli, ""burn, baby, burn!""
With no rocks to sack up I wonder who can I jack up
Along with this .44, which other heat should I pack up?
Niggas never been robbed by a guy short in size
If I put a 211 in progress, cooperate or die
Why fall in love with the struggle if the struggle don't love me?
So nigga, why should I watch you hustle off a whole ki?
If I say I want it, hand it over or watch the snub nose flame
The Chicken Hawk got to have it, dog, and that's on everything
Now Mr. Mike (What's up?) You out here ballin these streets
Now front your partner a few ones, until he back on his feet
And that ain't askin for much if that's somethin that you can do
Cause you know if you was short, a nigga'd look out for you

Alright we done, back to the lab without a mic to grab
Can't take this poverty, crews sling

I'm on the run till I finally find the right one

Back when the world was small

[Chorus:]
That was a river
This is the ocean
That never carried
This much emotion
Nothing compares to
This deep emotion
That was a river
This is the ocean

The love we had before
Can never change this one
We're not imprisoned by
The past we've brought along
It's just you and me
One ship in the night
There are no boundaries
There is no end in sight

[Chorus]

Nothing compares to
This deep emotion
That was a river
This is the ocean
That was a river
This is the ocean",Purple People Eater,
Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire,"My face shining, looking like some salmon skin
All twelve Reggie Hammond, holding hammers him
Never speak, he like that short silent type
I’m in the mountains shovin' knives, drinking wine at night
Rose petals get thrown to the feet
Know we grow knee ’cause even in this rap don't work we got stones in the street
Go down in Tallahassee, work and come home in a week
See me stoned in a Jeep with the chrome on the feet
Leather overalls, shirtless like I'm Kells in the street
Posing for flicks, leaning on an English whip
With the float ware straight from the aquarium
My bitch built like secretariat, yeah, bring the chariot
I fuck the pussy, not marry it, world on my shoulders, dougie, I carry it
I’m more than happy with my bitch, she got no saggy tits
I’ll do it old school style and give her baggy dick

Rock, rock, very
Slow, slow, steady
Base, base, heavy
Drum, drums, ready

They talk in cents, diamonds in our tooths and dinner (ice)
Rap game Burt Reynolds in a candy canteloupe car rental
I’m in the trash compactor, black shades like famous actor
Bank account doin' gymnastics, flip
40 cal. in the Razorback starter jacket (Arkansas)
I switch up like south paw, frozen teeth look like tiger claws
Look like a pain to massage my upper bums and lower jowls (igloos)
My wedding gifts consists of Versace blend, ice out contenders, didn’t mean to offend you
When I pull up the [?], in the candy leather [?]
Flush out the system with niacin, 40 lines of the Vicodin
Still childish and violent, with appetite for violins
Disappearing act like Sister, Sister
Lost the biscuits, city slickers, rap game Billy Crystal

Pass our nuts, shit, ain’t no courtesy flush
Fuck black bitches till they bruise, white hoes till they flush
Fuck pretty bitches in their face, dick holes in their butts
Bumping mace [?]
[?] sipping more lean with Goldie
Sweaty minks in the summer like it’s snowing
Pummel all opponents turn gold if I concentrate
Scrape the plate rap for my team, bought a cheese greater
Eggplant, Parmesan with [?] seen him do a pushup on the back of his head
Acting like I’m certified, niggas get nervous when I’m walking
Nudge each other and whisper that’s him
Y’all niggas, cooch, pussies
I’mma cool off his noose on the loose sipping hooch
Flow’s out the colon, TYB chosen, bust it wide open with my staff like Moses

Mr. Neveux,"There's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now just carry it alone

There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home",To Miss C,1998

Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid

You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar

And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G

Some people been driving to fast
Some people still having a gas
But if there's one thing you gotta concede,
You gotta know who's driving you car,
You get to fifth gear with your foot on the floor
Or else you're starring in “a cruise too far”

Turn on, tune in, cop out
Let it flow now mama,
Turn on, tune in, cop out
Let it flow become a woman

Some people been wasting their time
Some people expanding their minds
But if you've known love like the jokers before
Then you're likely to be home on the range
No more the cowboy gottsa flaunt his wares

Turn on, tune in, cop out
Let it flow now mama
Turn on, tune in, and cop out
Let it flow become a woman

It's easy to see why there's a thousands of people
Are regularly turning it out
And it's easy to find when you mess with your mind
That you've gone beyond a reasonable doubt…

Can you see?
The strangest things are happening to me
If you can, you know, we're a long way from home
If you can, you know, we're a long way from home

Dimmi perché dovrei chiedere perdono
Se per adesso ancora sono (lost in the world)
Mi sveglio lunedì a Milano, non mi passa un cazzo
Testa fuori dalla porta, frate è un mondo marcio
Casa mia perde acqua come un lavandino
Il paese è benestante ma lo stato è malandrino
Cerco di restare cool, cool, distaccato
Per questa pila viaggio come un turista, per caso
Primo step del mio viaggio vado a London Town
No doubt, sono (lost in the world)
Ho i soldi appiccicati in testa come un toupet
In metro a Londra tipo oy where's the chip, mate?
Voglio un orologio grande come il Big Ben
Per mettermelo al polso e completare il cliché
Di un italiano sempre in fuga da un paese in panne
Voglio un futuro perché tutto il mio passato è in fiamme
E mentre volo tra le palme della California, mi dico tutto torna

Lost in the world
Can you see? (non lo vedi, non lo vedi?)
The strangest things are happening to me (mi vogliono a terra e sono ancora in piedi)

Easy rider California in mezzo ai macchinoni
Per me la vita non è un gioco frà, non ho opzioni
Prendo il sole fumo bene perso L.A.
In mezzo ai Cholos, loco come un L6
Così tanto verde la vista non è più grigia
L'italiano vero ha sempre la moka in valigia
Nuovo giorno altro business volo a New York
True talk, sono (lost in the world)
Perso nella grande, mela giungla di cemento
Scusami un momento (lost in the world)
In un taxi giallo, la vita gioca a calcio e a me ha fatto un maxi fallo (lost in the world)
Ma non avere paura per me, è tutto ok
La mia ambizione è più alta dell'Empire State
Ecco perché quando rappo applaudi
Un'Italia senza Marcio? (minchia, forget about it)

E sono perso nel mondo, perso nel mondo 
Sono perso nel mondo, perso nel mondo
Ma frà aspetta un secondo, anche se ti senti tutti contro, non è mica la fine del mondo
Perché siamo tutti

Mr. Peppa,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Mr. Philips,"Check, check this happened for real frankie j. obsession

It's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinking bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossing turning in my bed
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinking bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love
Baby

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Mr phillip it could be an obsession

No puede ser amor tiene que ser una ilusion
 no tiene explicacion
Lo poquito que me ha hecho me tiene bien loco

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)

I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
It's an obsession

Now I know you're not my lady 
But I'm just tryin to make this right 
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind 
So baby if u let me 
Kick it witchu well than maybe we could ride together 
We could do this all nite 
Now I dont care if u got a man 
Baby I wish you'd understand 
Cuz I know he can't love u right, quite like I can

Juego que yo ya tenia ganado no soy malvado nomas lo que es
Pero mi fama de malandro la agarre a los diesyseis a si que pues
Nimodo que me deje que me chinguen el rap no lo aprendi en un
Pinche colegio bilingue lo aprendi en la calle donde vergas
Esperabas al chile no me paran con machetes o pedradas o
Queman plomo pa jalar como yo jalo le agarro la cintura hasta
Cuando vayan al baño por que este babo esta re-loco no se
Si por el foco por los acidos o el choco pero asi es y asi sera

Metan con el morrillo del cartel vengo desde guadalupe para santa
Hay donde los huevos mandan y los perros cantan tengo varios
Vatos en mi lista negra cuando oigan los cuetasos al chile de mi se
Acuerdan o que apoco ya culearon si aqui todo se paga jotos ya se
La pelaron escuchen al tirano putos luego nos topamos que al cabo
Arrieros somos y en el camino andamos

De lunes a domingo en lo mismo perdido en el abismo vicioso
Concentrado y cabalgar el ritmo nunca chingo sin un buena razon
Mi tres ochenta basta pa explotarte el corazon escuchame cabron
Que yo rimo siempre en serio dejo de ser misterio que te espera el
Cementerio maricon y eso de milagro si es que alguien haya tus
Restos cuatro metros bajo tierra tapan el olor a muerto fuma de esto
Por que digo la vedad solo compara mi letra con mi historia criminal
Animal ya le meti ocho biles y esto no se compara con sus rimas
Infantiles correo ve y diles a todos compinches que llego el
Matachinches que los mata con el trinche el pinche babo no hay
Quien me linche los apago cuando la santa muerte siempre
Cabalga a mi lado

Lo aviento y si quieren agarrarme al baño tambien me la feito

Clavada una escopeta con pura de cinco pa sumbartela en la jeta el
Puñetas que estabas esperando que saliera corriendo con tu
Pistola de diablo traigo el mando mas que por malandro por
Cantarles con huevos y estos pinches pendejos pensado que yo
Era nuevo ando al puro pedo con billetes en la bolsa por si me
Tuercen los cuetes darles su mochada al chota no me importan sus
Jaladas inventadas como dice la brasil ustedes son pura mamada

Destiny, now can you tell me wha's tha meanin
Where I'm goin in this life,its so trife,I get to skeemin and dreamin
Is thea a way I can make my route pay
Talkin bout tha shit I used to do back in tha day
But hey, times are hard and 4 me its get harder
Got so many problems, they jus build up real quick like tarter
Avoid tha few, and jus hang wit tha crew, as if you didn't knew
It be that Stoneycrook crew, its a hard life
And its affectin me so strong, sleepin hea and sleepin thea
Not havin a place to call my home, this is wrong
I ain't neva had it hard like this
But momma always told it would be a day like this
Dirty po shit, baby I can't do it too long
Cause I don had too much to stay down, gotta eat and stay strong
Even though my brotha, he'll be thea through thick and thin
Won't be gon in tha wind, like so called friends
Pick up tha pen, let if flow like tha Trinity
Problems steady killin me, gotta get some ends in my vicinity
I'm in it deep, reep when I'm smashin on yo homies
I didn't want to do it, me and my baby need some money
Hungry for this rap shit, phony, oh no, not this
Wanted by tha po-po's, they won't get me, I'm too swift
Dip off to tha Cliff, K-Roc fiya up this splif
Ain't nobody pagin me, cut our pager off this hip, its a trip
Chorus[x4]
Wha is my Destiny? Tell me
[K-Roc]
Got some problems in my mind, rewind, so I can find it
These niggaz need to realize, my team gon keep climbin
To find tha true meanin, haitian, devestation
Not knowin wha you're facin, can be a lifetime complication
So I'm lacin, these blunts wit weed, keep my G's, right beside me
I dunno where danger is goin to find me
Behind these doors that's where I stay
Wit a blunt up in my mouth and a cocked AK
And each day, I get tempted by these hoe ass niggaz
So-So ass niggaz, jus po ass niggaz
And I been broke before playa, but I kept my dreamin
And I ain't neva lettin it go 4 no goddamn cream
Now fuck a football team, fuck that shit, what this means
Is that I be damned if I'm 40 still servin these fiends
And all tha shit I seen, wasn't no diamonds and pearls
My destiny is to be blind from this fucked up world
Nigga!!!!!!

[Mr. Pookie]
Still doin bad, but life is bout to change
My homie jus called me cause he was bout to lace tha game
You willin to rip it wit Tha Rockla and Tha Rap?
Makin bread off wha you said, puttin Dallas on tha map
Say no mo, I'll be ready when tha time is right
Got to be patient in this game, but that's hard in life
I got to fight, off hataz while I'm duckin tha laws
Keep some money in my pocket, clothes, shoes and draws
Neva pause, if I do I might slip off wit tha lifeless
Beggin to tha Lord, bring me closer to tha brightness
How can I fight this?
A bag of weed, feelin loco wit my crooks, gotta skeem 4 cheese
My opportunity came so I grabbed it
Now I see my future in tha mist of all tha bad shit
Hopin I don't pass it, tryin to keep a job and chill
But now thea's 2 things on my patience, have no time to live
Still feelin like I'm young, but I'm old enuff
I must be trippin, get a hold of it, control tha stuff
Leave tha lust of my dealin wit tha fools who want it
Keep on slangin though you'll find a betta way to get up on it
Listen homie it won't last long, wait til yo cash gon
You gon be feelin bad cause you broke and you smash on
No mo sackin and flippin burgers from scratch
I'm in tha studio, rippin up tracks

Come runnin' with tec-9's whenever niggaz would call
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang, shoot up classway halls
I don't give a fuck, who you call to come
You came with thirty niggaz, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a nigga got in me
You gone off henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
Situations you in, don't get that ""purple pills"" shit confused
With us bein cool up here singin ""my band""
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a fuckin autograph
So say that shit loud enough out of the fuckin crowd and
I'll show you the meanin' of die-hard fans
Saddam hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that mitchell and ness
So find your spinal cord, uh-uh-oh I digress
I guess I'm just too fresh, to finish that line

Mr. Porter,"[Mr. Porter]
I'm just playing wit y'all niggas, I'm just playing wit y'all niggas
I'm just playing wit y'all niggas, I'm just playing wit y'all niggas!

They told me to! [echoes]

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raw)
They so cold, I know, that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
'Cause you see how this money can change your friends' faith

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Motherfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggas, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, they disbelieved and they speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
how niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
niggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong motherfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggas busy trying to fuck with my bitch
Same niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit
that they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggas get, shit around you will change
Even though niggas'll flip and say, ""He the one changed""
Fuck you, the dude'll just'll justify, taking his shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
'Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, blood of my blood! Flesh of my flesh!",They're out to Get Me,2006
Mr. Porter,"I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may kiss the bride

Cops comin', shots fired, babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change but this is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired, babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change but this is just my life

God, why is my wife bleedin'
Sheet covers her face, paramedics are leavin'
Her eyes are closed, it's apparent she's not breathin'
I'm a little confused about what it is I'm seein'

Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the livin' room with all of they guns drawn
Out and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is

I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cell phone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six pack of O'Douls and some soul food

Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it, 'cause my wife isn't back from her trip
I sneak ? into the house
And she'll never expect it, except that

Cops comin', shots fired, babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change but this is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired, babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change but this is just my life

He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

I tied his hands behind his back to the night stand, fast
Ropes made bruises on his light skinned ass
See, I can play games too
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to

Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck man, we grew up together
Run DMC, tougher than leather

With the same outfits, forty deuce
Takin' flicks like what, shit
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man

I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everythin' you imagined? Was it perfect?

He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

He put the gun in my hand and told
Told me to go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away, no
It's only gon' bring more pain

Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love and cherish but
Death did us apart, what a coincidence
Now, perhaps the police will be convinced

That it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker trespassin' up my residence
And to believe those vile set a precedence
From the start I should have been obvious, I never did

Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art

And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
365 days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

Evil eyes that bide, how they go
You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry but slowly you try, so slowly you die

Buried alive in the grave, too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
Old friend of mine she sleepin' with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times

And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishin' checks and royalties
She's thinkin' it's true love, he's scammin' her for the quop
? to devise my own intuitive plot

Put the pros on him, launched the probe on him
Now harm him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted

Guess who you're 'bout to murder tonight?
Miss pretty brown eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib, you'll find under the mat
In the front of the house, just do it, word out

Evil eyes that bide, how they go
You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry but slowly you try, so slowly you die",Trilogy,2007

Mr. Porter,"Oh, that's that smooth shit
(Twista! L.A.D.! Devin the Dude!)
We 'bout to do this shit like this
Yo Drama, take that shit back for 'em one time (uh-oh!)

Ha ha, cocaine in the flesh
Been in the game since Brand Nubian was spittin', reign of the tec'
I done spit lyrics for DJ Jam Master Jay and Kid Capri
Now it's DJ Drama, now you all on the dick lil' mama?
Where the fuck was you at when a nigga was on the block? (where you at?)
When the nigga was drivin' dirty Nike's with no knot (where you at?)
Before the Billboard number one spot
It was so hard to get a bitch to get down and suck on a cock
Before rockin' the Bentley and I got so popular
Thuggin' with the G.D.'s you wouldn't see me even with binoculars
Steady actin' like you ain't been ran through
Never gave a nigga no pussy now you sweatin' and talkin' 'bout you a fan too
Before the Vin houses and the trucks and Impalas
Tell me where was you at when the nigga needed a couple of dollars
I remember her off the block, now I can't fuck with lil' mama
Walk off on that hoe, I'd rather let another bitch holla

[Chorus]
Spend the rest of the life in the trap bein' grimy (oh yeah)
On the grind tryin' to stay out the county (oh)
Limit ties when I ain't had no money (oh yeah)
Got bread now, these bitches all on me
Cause underneath all the cars and clothes (cars and clothes)
The lights, the bling, and oh
Oh oh oh, diamonds and gold
Underneath all the diamonds still cold, yeah

Yeah, L.A.D., uh,
Bitches used to say ""ugh,"" now I got pull
My life like Ace, from ""Paid in Full""
Low like a turtle, my queen mad fertile
Run a marathon, same time, jumpin' hurdles
Put a broad on a plane, brick in her girdle
Why I'm still here, got my life in gear
Fuckin' a rich white bitch like Britney Spears
Runnin' in her hard like a car hit a deer
Live life no fear, boxed in like a square
Two Coronas with lime, sip my beer
My vision's so clear from the front to the rear
That's why I'm reclined in a La-Z-Boy chair
Can't see me like I'm air, but I'm there
Mean I'm here, like Ray Lewis or Steve McNair
Real Hall-of-Famer, real big gamer
Semi-automatic or a four-fifth flamer, blaow!

[Chorus]

It's a blessin' to be still in the game
Considerin' where I came from the music changed
Some would continue to hang
I'm, right where I oughta be
Whatever obstacle in the way, won't let it bother me
Grindin' since the early teens in my dirty jeans
Now I'm on the scene fulfillin' my worldly dreams
So get yours, I'll get mine in due time
We'll be able to survive some lunatic rhymes
But nowadays you gotta find different ways
To keep your pockets on fat, who got it? Where it's at?
Shit, you gotta go get it
The road you gotta hit it, the show money's splitted
Yeah, and if everybody wit it we can make somethin' happen
With the push of these buttons and some cut-cuttin' and scratchin'
I've been rappin for years, and I think I'm gonna
Sang or do anything other than slang on the corners
I'm gone

I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
Better listen up close nigga, don't trip
Your heat's in the car, mine's in this bitch

Trigger man, etiquette, one felony away from a predicate

Like they owned by Edison, I am on my better than
Everybody tip, walk up in the club make
Everybody strip, everybody get...the fuck down
This a brrp, stick up
But I don't want no money, I want your...liquor

That I can't fuck bitch? Fuck this, I've been dope, flashy

What the fuck do you mean, that I ain't in shape? Go bag Nelly
I go and get me a fat bitch, we gon' slap bellies
I keep a box of rubbers, cock, I got ya covered
That's right, I talk to my cock often like, ""Cock, they love ya""
Ha-ha, I walk the block with a oven but not your mother's
I'm talking 'bout the other, by the way, your mother
I'm terrific, I'm the president, I'm Obama-rific
Make up my own words, I'm the shitidic
