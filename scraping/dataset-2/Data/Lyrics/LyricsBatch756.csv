Murray Head,"(Judas)
There he is
They're all asleep, the fools

(Jesus)
Judas, must you betray me 
With a kiss?

(Peter and Apostles)
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
Hang on Lord
We're gonna fight for you

(Jesus)
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice but now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to fishing from now on

(Crowd)
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved all worthwhile?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Come on God this is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel

Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You just love the high priest's house
You just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Now we have him, now we got him
Now we have him, now we got him

(Caiaphas)
Jesus you must realize
The serious charges facing you
You say you're the son of God
In all your handouts
Well is it true?

(Jesus)
That's what you say
You say that I am",The Arrest,1970
Murray Head,"My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me
Ah ah
Come on, listen, listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah ah",Heaven On Their Minds,1970
Murray Head,"JUDAS

My God! I saw him.
He looked three-quarters dead!
And he was so bad I had to turn my head.
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good.
I'd save him all this suffering if I could.
Don't believe...our good...
And I'd save him if I could...

ANNAS

Cut the confessions, forget the excuses.
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse.
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance.
The mob turned against him, you backed the right horse.

CAIAPHAS

What you have done will be the saving of everyone.
You'll be remembered forever for this.
And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts.
Pretty good wages for one little kiss.

JUDAS

Christ, I know you can't hear me,
But I only did what you wanted me too.
Christ, I'd sell out the nation,
For I have been saddled with the murder of you.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud!
I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
He is not a king. He is just the same
As anyone I know.
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?
My mind is in darkness.
God, God I'm sick. I've been used,
And you knew all the time.
God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.
You're so bloody, Christ.

CHOIR

Poor old Judas. So long Judas.

JUDAS

You have murdered me.",Judas's Death,1970
Murray Head,"APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now, I can see the answers
'Till this evening is this morning, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JESUS

The end...is just a little harder, when brought about by friends.
For all you care, this wine could be my blood.
For all you care, this bread could be my body.
The end! This is my blood you drink.
This is my body you eat.
If you would remember me when you eat and drink.
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.
Yes, I must be out of my head.
Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead.
One of you denies me.
One of you betrays me.

APOSTLES

No! Who would?! Impossible!

JESUS

Peter will deny my in just a few hours.
Three times will deny me,
And that's not all I see.
One of you here dining,
One of my twelve chosen
Will leave to betray me.

JUDAS

Cut the dramatics!
You know very well who.

JESUS

Why don't you go do it?

JUDAS

You want me to do it!

JESUS

Hurry, they are waiting.

JUDAS

If you knew why I do it

JESUS

I don't care why you do it!

JUDAS

To think I admired you.
Well now I despise you.

JESUS

You liar. You Judas.

JUDAS

You want me to do it!
What if I just stayed here
And ruined your ambition.
Christ you deserve it.

JESUS

Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.
Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,
'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll all talk about us when we've died.

JUDAS

You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,
Our ideals die around us and all because of you.
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.
A jaded mandarin,
A jaded mandarin,
Like a jaded, faded, faded, jaded, jaded mandarin.

JESUS

Get out they're waiting! Get out!
They're waiting, Oh, they are waiting for you!

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.

It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On women of her kind
Yes, I can understand that she amuses
But to let her stroke you, kiss your hair
Is hardly in your line
It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
They only need a small excuse to put us all away

Who are you to criticize her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now
If your slate is clean, then you can throw stones
If your slate is not, then leave her alone
I'm amazed that a man like you
Can be so shallow, thick and slow
There is not a man among you
Who knows or cares if I come or go

No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong

Murray Head,"Darling you'll love it, it's down on the corner
Wearing those star-studded high heel boots
Wear your mascara, try on the tiara
Perhaps it'll cover up some of your roots
She's such a drag
She's such a drag

Leather for pleasure, whatever the weather
Cruisin' and losin' her old cares and woes
Street invitation, the newest sensation
Forget your intention when your petticoat shows
She-she such a drag
Ooh! She such a drag

Step up on the merry-go-round
There's plenty room for more
It's a carnival, a circus that we've gotta preserve
It's the meatiest show of all",She's Such a Drag,1976
Murray Head,"Can't you hear me calling, I'm shouting out loud
Maybe you've mistaken me for one of the crowd
My back's against the wall, my feeling's on show
Silence is the only reply that I know

The sleeping dog in me won't lie
But when I'm woken you can't, no can't deny
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
When dreams are broken silence is a strong reply

Can't you hear me laughing, exposing my fears

Can't you see me crying, withholding the tears
There isn't any point in closing your hears
The silence that's between us is the passing of years
Take a breath where the earth touches the sky
We can both feel the reason why
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
Because silence is a strong reply
Silence is a strong reply",Silence Is a Strong Reply,1976
Murray Head,"I've been travelling hard tho' there didn't seem much to move me,
And my senses were numbed as the scenery passed right thru' me,
Down a telephone line it was easy enough to lose me,
But with you on my side, it was easy to ride
The storm and the tide, as they bruised me.
How many ways are there left to say I love you.

I kept telling myself my wounds were on the mend.
But my confidence slides when I can't tell who's a friend.
There were nights when I cried and I could not see the end.
But something within, made me still want to win
As I realized within me, was you.
How many ways are there left to say I love you.

She said, ""I don't know what to feel anymore
When you're home it's too much, when you're gone I'm unsure
Can't you admit there are times when you're wrong,
You've been away from me one week too long"".

I'd lean against bars, hopelessly killing time
Talking out dreams and drowning my fears in wine.
Avoiding the bed that brings a sadness that's hard to define.
When the day breaks again I go back to the same
Empty room, and the pain of us being apart.
This is the time when I need to say I love you.

How many ways are there left to say I love you.",How Many Ways,1985

Now the past she sadly recalls.
Mademoiselle lived in grand hotels
Ordered clothes by Chanel and Dior
Millionaires queued at her door.

Oh, she pleased them and teased them
She hooked them and squeezed them
Until like their empires they'd fall
She very soon learned
That the more love she spurned
The more power she yearned
Until she was belle of the ball.

Oh, Mademoiselle, such a soft machiavel
Would play bagatelle with the hearts of young men as
They fell
Mademoiselle would hide in her shell
Could then turn cast a spell on any girl
That got in her way.

She would crave all attention
Men would flock to her side
Woe betide any man who ignored
For she'd feign such affection
Then break down their pretension
When she'd won she would turn away.
Turn away, thoroughly bored.

Mademoiselle, long ago said farewell
To any love left to sell, for the sake of being belle
Of the ball
Mademoiselle knows there's no way to quell
Her own private hell, just a shell, 
With no heart left at all.
Poor old Mademoiselle.
Still a Mademoiselle.",Mademoiselle,2001
Murray Head,"Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And we want you to sleep well tonight.
Let the world turn without you tonight.
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh.
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight.

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Woman your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor.
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more.
People who are hungry, people who are starving
They matter more than your feet and hair!

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling.
Look at the good things you've got.
Think while you still have me!
Move while you still see me!
You'll be lost, and you'll be sorry when I'm gone.

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead/

But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast

Look out the saints are comin' through

Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you

All your reindeer armies, are all going home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind

Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Haunts my reverie

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Murray McLauchlan,"Dusty old farmer out working your fields
Hanging down over your tractor wheels
The sun beatin' down turns the red pain to orange
And rusty old patches of steel
There's no farmer songs on that car radio
Just cowboys, truck drivers and pain
Well this is my way to say thanks for the meal
And I hope there's no shortage of rain

Straw hats and old dirty hankies
Mopin' a face like a shoe
Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real
From a kid from the city to you

The combines gang up, take most of the bread
Things just ain't like they used to be
Though your kids are out after the American dream
And they're workin in big factories
Now If I come on by, when you're out in the sun
Can I wave at you just like a friend
These days when everyone's taking so much
There's somebody giving back in

Straw hats and old dirty hankies
Mopin' a face like a shoe
Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real
From a kid from the city to you",Farmer's Song,

I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Murray Ross,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me

That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1991
Murray Ross,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for

Murray Ross,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Murray Ross,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Murray Ross,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Murray Ross,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Murray Ross,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose

Murray Ross,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2000
Murray Wall,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Murray Wall,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

And you always remind me that my baby's gone
Evening, you got me deeply in your power
Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance

Murray Watson,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,1974
Murray Watson,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1974
Murry Wilson,"I guess I'm not the kind of boy 
Who's seen it all before 
Anymore 
I thought I'd figured out the way 
To see the sunny side 
Of the day 

Making plans, making good 
And keep on asking on 
Could it be so good 

I'll have to sit and calculate 
Think myself a mess 
For the best 
It seems I have to complicate 
All the thing I see 
Lucky me 

And when you all go out to play 
I'll keep an eye on you 
For a clue 
Cause I won't take it anymore 
Being the jealous one 
In the sun 

And when I come and see the light 
Heaven help you all 
At the sight 
'Cause fireworks and movie screens 
Can't prepare you all 
For the scene 
All my plans making good 
I can't stop thinking now it'll be so good 

'Cause now it seems I'm all the rage 
Such a tender heart 
Such and early age

I can't stop thinking now

Murs,"Aight,
I'm the sickest with this microphone, nigga better learn it
All them bitch industry niggaz you know I ain't concerned with
See I move thousands hand to hand, even got an increasin' number of fans
In foreign lands, Amsterdam, Australia to Japan
All before my sign hit the line that was dotted
The man holdin' the golden apple, y'all grapple for the one that's rotted
To the core I've been hard, since 1580
Mack attack nigga I've been scarred, knowin' what the fuck I gotta do
Fuckin' rockin' a spot or two I wanna leave an impression on minds
Like reading ""Behold a Pale Horse"" for the first time
Expose wack niggas like secret societies when Murs rhyme
Explore cyphers after I visit, for close encounters with the serf kind
Your nigga thought he was nice, until he heard mine
And the doper you think you gettin' the more you ain't understood the first line
I said learn of my affliction, and how my words wrap around
More niggas necks than the pictures of the crucifixions
Rippin' mics when on
Name hold more weight than a 24 inch python
So what'chu gonna do, when Murs-mania run wild on you?
Bringin' that crack to your back like the whip in Castlevania 2
And I'm through, bitch

[Chorus]
When I grab a microphone, all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back
Now when I grab a microphone all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back

Now I write rhymes as dope as Jennifer Lopez
Words, beautify blank paper
Like, top to bottom pieces on skyscrapers
Ain't no stoppin' us
Rollin thick like smog through your metropolis
Makin' it hard to breathe
When you enter the 20,000 leagues, so stay at your level and place
Cause amateurs fuckin' with the treble and bass
Will get left dead before they make the third pace
See I turn around shootin' off at the mouth, like New Year's Eve
Sayin' that shit you just, wouldn't believe
Retrieved from the far corners of my mental space
Leave you shocked like John Travolta once you open up this mental case
So we happy, as long as fools stop tryin'
To come up from the back and attack me, like my name was Marcellus
And those overzealous we got our blowtorch and pliers
So you for damn sure gonna tell us what we want to hear
Sorta like my album but ""Life is Too $hort"" so I'm tryin' to make one a year
To make y'all niggas watch what you do like the Wonder Years
Watch them niggas you think is down
They only down cause they carryin', a ton of fear
It's been a while since I've relieved myself of that burden
So I'm makin' sure I'm goin all out, until they call it curtains
While you busy in the man's face shuckin' and smirkin'
I'll be lurkin' in the cut, happy with bein' the broke nigga that I am
It's all about the Washington's, what!",Ease Back,1997
Murs,"""Ready to BREAK, THE, ICE
 Feels like time is standing still""

Now this fool been on my ass for the past couple years
Jumped on the scene from nowhere, takin out all my peers
And of my whole squad I'm the last one left
Cause for some strange reason I always stay one step ahead
Of this Agent named Red
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why my ass ain't dead
And now I clear my head, as we arrive on the site
Makin' sure, all routes for escape are sealed off airtight
Thinkin' to myself, tonight's the night
Cause I know exactly where he's going
Fuck the double-oh-seven, I'm the Living Legend
With the Goldeneye holding my rifle for assault
Aimed directly at the vault
But what happened next, wasn't even my fault
You see from the rear, a strange mist appeared
Strapped on the infrared gear too late
Because soon as it came, it disappeared
And when the smoke cleared, the package was gone
My squad searched savage 'til dawn; then had to e-mail HQ
That the knight had just captured the pawn
We swept the crime scene but it was clean, no clues left behind
So I shot back to the hotel
Had a couple drinks, now I'm back online
Not knowin that's where I'd find the next clue
It said Agent Blue, I'll meet you next
Where the stars are at they best and the sun rest too
So I headed due West
To the town where every night creates a new murder story
But stars at they best didn't mean Hollywood, but the observatory
So I cased the joint
Faced the point that I might not know if I was it
Came across the schedule of events
Next on the list to speak was the scientist
Set to unravel, new theories on time travel
Theories that my agency, already knew to be proven
I guess Red's clients was gonna try to stop us on the move-in
Now I know exactly what he's doin'
So the next day at the lecture
I came disguised as the staff director
Even ushered Agent Red himself down the aisle
And just had to smile cause he didn't even know it was me
Then I shot to the balcony where I was supposed to be
Got to the top, my heart damn near stopped
This boy left the spot
Before I could ask where did he go
I turned around lookin' down the barrel of his fo'-fo'
He was like hey yo, just follow me down the hall
And we won't have no problems at all
So I did that, slid the gat into position
Just in case he tried to make this my last mission
Walked all the way down the hallway into an empty room
Where I assumed I'd be dead
Waited a couple of seconds, turned my head
Fool puttin' down his weapons, so I did the same
Slipped my coat off, and jumped into a stance
To let this fool know he was about to get broke off
He spoke soft, said it was to death
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, but when I opened my eyes
This fool's about to catch me by surprise
With the first series of blows
I'm up to par, I stayed on my toes
But connected with the next swing
Cut me hella deep with his ring
I looked down at his hand, damn
That's the same ones the man from the agency
Said I had around my neck when they found me
I thought he was the only one in existence
But this nigga ground me, so I held up my hand
So he could see what I saw, he stood there in awe
Dropped his guard, I took one to the jaw
But he didn't trip cause it only made us even
We stood there for a second not believin' the shit
We sat down, talked for a grip, I came up on hella dirt
Found out we was brother separated at birth
By the agency especially trained to maintain
The illusion of international espionage
By holdin' up this mirage
Everybody in the Department of National Defense got rich
Now ain't that a bitch? They say we ain't got enough ends
In the budget, for public housing education and health care
So right then and there
Me and my brother about to plan to get over on the man
Went back to the agencies and played the role
But on the under strived towards one common goal
See we both contraband in foreign lands, it'll be enough
We give a fuck, we move the shit by the truck
And the scheme worked like a beauty
So after a couple years we injured ourselves in the line of duty
And of course the agencies showed us no love
But now this is the story I tell my children
On the shores of the islands we bought
From the money we came up off of, bitch!",The Saint,1997
Murs,"You didn't think me and El was comin like this
Def Jux Motherfucker and we run this shit
Got you all up on your keyboard stunnin and shit
Oh you got a couple jokes now you funny bitch (HA HA)
Have you laughin all the way to the bank
On point make a cut like we holdin a shank
Got it all up on ya back now you walkin a plank
Try to do it like this but you drawin a blank
Do it double time all up in yo face
Like piranhas when you drop fresh meat in the tank
Fell off of the game can't keep ya rank
Mad cause you try to rock sweet but you ain't
Been around no-will shit where crews peel clips
Niggaz that kill for fun
Wanna talk that ill shit sayin how you kill shit
Bullets still in ya gun
Koolaid in ya veins so now you gotta change clothes
'cause you pissed ya pants
Saw me durango said you wanna tango
Now this is the dance
Where ya shoes at where ya crew at
Claim you do gats but you do rap
What you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst
Push ya girl on the ground so that you can run first
Now you about to get rolled up hold up wait
Just an emcee that was tryin to make cake
Now you gotta gun all up in ya face
All of a sudden found god like run and mase
Thought it be fun to front on tape
Now you wish you woulda have stuck to drum n' bass
But you had to be hard on the boulevard
When you never gang banged a day in ya town
Try to be a manhuter the streets ain't a jungle gym nigga stop playin
Around
Lay it down

This is the Dance!
You don't wanna be late 'cause the moment won't wait betta get ya shit straight
This is ya Chance!
You don't have to be fake with a heart full of hate just try to say thanks

Murs fall up on the spot like what up bitch
Approached the finest girl like shutup bitch
Than I grab the microphone and I cut up kids
Like a hot knife straight through a butter stick
Now I'm in the spotlight about to rock all night
Shot of tequila than a hot mamacita
Who said she know to swallow but not margaritas
Body on point so I follow the leader
Need more tequila so I swallow the liter
How can the night get sweeter (cant)
So I passed out woke up do it again
Won't neva roll up ya crew in the wind
High velocity high viscocity slippin right pass your animosity
Fans are constantly, askin me
Who said what and who has beef
My crew got stuck in we to musty
So try to weigh it out with the truth laid out (stop the gossip)
That's just played out there's more to ya life than underground rap
What you waste all ya time and you wanna run it back
All on the message board runnin ya yap
At the end of the night only wanted to chat
Now you know that you got issues
That early in the morn you should look at some porn
And jack off right in the tissue
Than call it a night that's probley the life
Go to sleep with the girl that you callin ya wife
Wake up to the same shit different day
Everybody onto work and they on the way
Cause we all got bills and rent to pay
Lent to the earth wasn't meant to stay
So before I'm gone I wanna make a hit song that'll always get some play
Got the homey el producto workin in the cut so what you got to say

(El-P)
You wanna trace along the pattern of fair please rest
I wanna pattern how the drum scheme mechanism I.D. jux breath commence fresh
Test the mesh, metal on the chestplate tech
Better wear the smile right, wanna frown like die right
With a highlight primal fright in a prime life of a double ox razor blade fade like 88'
It's the revenge on the whits and lazerface oh break two three

They couldn't move like el, ox, murs, lif or bazooka tooth die so useless
So use this tip that'll have a little truth in it like (poof)

All compositive battle turn logic pretty
All the hard edge tomorrow brings heads or home up in me come get me
I'm for this shitty dizzy spinning lawless constant progress whose with me
Fabolous thunder bird word nerd unda that tom pill shit
Who heard kill quick
And independent since 96' they still ride ya dick
I refined the style with wild wit from an era with an automan mix
Community watch groups enlist young kids
Hit the road skippy
I don't answer to you george bush or the war time committee
Dumber than a mongaloid race movin shit
With a heart of hell's tutelage bruisin shit
Every time you make a move the industry start the new movement kid
I'm not losin bitch
Essentially on the edge of a generations new ruthlesness
Who's in charge, take me to ya leader man stop the foolishness
Cop the new shit bitch



",The Dance,2003
Murs,"[Verse 1] 
Now some claim gangsta rap's the CNN of the streets
But it's used as an excuse to pretend over beats
So I'ma lend my speech to all within my reach
To tell what really goes on from cells to the streets
Now in LA as you know there's a war going on
And it's been going on since before I was born
Though the undisputed origin has yet to be formed
It all used to boil down to the red and the blue
But that got fucked up as the many led the few
Now there's bloods killin' bloods and crips killin' crips
That's niggas killin' niggas they play kickball with
It ain't as simple as it was way back in '86
Let me give an example of some ol' MURS shit
My sect of mid-city is livin' on the edge
'cause there's four gangs at war and none of them wear red
Any new car or face could mean bloodshed
Which led to the other night, I'm in my girl's Bug, right
I'm bout to hit the block to see who's chillin' on the spot outside
When I put it in park, the homey got a SK aimed at my ride
So I step out slowly, 'body no one fear
He yells, that's Murs I see his beard from here
But I told this whole story just to make things clear
So it don't seem weird when I tell ya this here

[Chorus ? 2x]
Last night I almost got shot on my block
Not the block where I live at, the block where I chill at
Where I keep it real at, and used to pack steel 
At times I feel it's the spot I'll get killed at

[Verse 2]
Now in the entertainment industry they have sweeps weeks
But it's Thursday in my hood when they sweep them streets
A whole fleet of the task that they simply call CRASH
That's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums
If anyone should ask what the acronym reflects
Put into effect to try to keep the gangs in check
Now they're just another gang out bangin' they set
Known for stirring up some shit when your hood is at peace
The only pig I know dying to create beef
But let me get on with my story so that all of y'all can peep
Once again I'm on my block right, known as Cloverdale
Playin' 2K2 while I'm talkin' on my cell well
While I'm inside eyes glued to the screen
CRASH rolls on my homies with the Thursday routine
What's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from
We say the same thing while they just play dumb
We don't gang-bang we got J-O-be's
Still they make 'em turn around and get down on they knees
Me, I'm screamin' in the house I just won by three
So when I run out on the porch to tell the homies come and see
I see 'em on the ground and I'm like, god damn
Plus I got this black Nextel phone in my hand
They both yell freeze, guns aimed at me
And even though I drop my phone it's plain to see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It was a 2 month tour that ended in Japan
So the first day back I had to spend it with my fam
That night I was goin' down to holler at my folks
Have a few beers, smoke, and share a few jokes so
To the block I bail but when I got to the dale
Everybody's on the porch lookin' distraught as hell
They start to tell me on how some fools from the other side
Just tried to kill T, he don't fuck with nobody
Just be mindin' his biz
So you have to understand what an explosive situation this Terry thing is
My nigga never gang-banged a day in his life so
Fuckin' with him is not a way to earn stripes
But a way to get wiped off the motherfuckin' planet
I don't claim to be a killer with a heart made of granite
But try to kill my best friend and it's on goddammit
I had the big homey roll me over to my place
So I could pick up this nine I kept just in case 
Of some shit like this, a box of hollow-tips
I slipped back to the block with the heat in my hand
We sat up in the house loadin' guns, makin' plans
They asked me was it stolen, and why I never told 'em
Nobody in the hood ever knew that I was holdin'
I told 'em I forgot but I did it on purpose
So they wouldn't ask to borrow it to go and do dirt with 
Now we locked and loaded and about to hit the streets
When we look to the corner there's a Jeep tryin' to creep
With its headlights off, we all leap for cover
They start to let off ? now how does this sound?
When I hit the deck, my pistol hits the ground
So the homey picked it up and let off a couple rounds
After that went down I knew I might get clowned
So I shook to the crib to take a shower and lay down
The next morning woke up, rolled out of bed
I called my girl up and this is what I said

[Chorus]

",The Night Before,2003
Murs,"[MURS]
Alright I'm ready
No, you're not ready
I'm ready, you're not ready
Motherfucker

(Indistinguishable singing)

[MURS]
Now this here's for your spouse or significant other
You were in love with the person, now you hate the motherfucker
Get the fuck out! Tell 'em to get the fuck out!
You weren't lookin' for love when you met 'em at the club
y'all exchanged numbers and went out for some grub
You waited three days then decided to call
Went for dinner and a movie, then a walk through the mall
All you saw was the physical, a sexy individual
Never had the thought that they would make your life miserable
A couple more dates, consummate the mating ritual
Soon you will encounter the habitual liar
The sex was so good it set your body afire
But why are you still with this nut?
Every time they come around you get this feelin in your gut
want to tell 'em, ""Raise up,"" but your mouth stays shut
When you stop to think about how good they fuck
An' when the sex gets old you'll wind up stuck
So here's some words of wisdom that'll help you with the chore
Count up their I.Q. before you kick 'em to the door
It goes:

[Chorus: MURS]
One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!  One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody!

[MURS]
Now say you have a homeboy who's been sleepin' on your couch
For weeks on end and he's (words walk em out?)
Get the fuck out! Tell him to get the fuck out!
Now he walks around your house in nothin' but his drawers
Throws the trash once a week and expects to get applause
Let him stay at your crib you was down for his cause
He was in between girls, or in between jobs
But it's still no excuse for him to be a slob
Your girl stays mad cause she's cleanin' up behind him
You can't get your calls when he's on the other line an'
You can't get laid cause he has the worst timin'
Knockin' at your door at odd hours of the night
If he does that shit again, you swear to God you're gonna fight
But you can't kick him out cause it's just not right
He has nowhere else to go, but you're losin' self-control
want to kill him in his sleep, God bless his soul
Maybe it's not that bad but it could get worse
So here's a little tip from your homeboy MURS
Before you tell him ""Bounce,"" do a countdown first
It goes:

[Chorus]

[MURS]
Now let's talk about these old motherfuckers on the mic
Who were dope but now are whack and won't leave the spotlight
Get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
He had some albums that I loved way back in the day
But as he puts out new shit, the memories begin to fade
When I heard about the comeback I said ""No way!""
I was waitin' on the real, the anticipation built
But with age came degeneration of the skill
So I pushed it to the back of my mind, and hoped in time
Those fine memories would once again shine
But he just won't stop, even though his album flop
Everytime I turn around his new one's about to drop
Make me want to take all his old records off the shelf
Cause the man I now hear's a shadow of his former self
So when he stopped on tour, in my town for a show
I played a true fan and was in the front row
As he started doin' classics, then he stopped and said ""No""
We had to say we love the new shit, before he did the old
I tried to count the countdown, but then I lost control
It went one, two, three, four
I had it up to here, and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!

Known to blast the competition
Break 'em up like New Edition
I'm gonna rob you, throb you, rip you with mics
And make you question your commitment like my dicks in your wife
And I'm hittin' it right
Now how's that for a visual to make your brain stall
Your old ball and chain now chained to my wall
I'mma reign 'till I fall, when I do I'll get a stunt double
Like to play it smart so I hump when there's trouble
While you try to go for broke with them punks in your huddle
I play Voldermolt and bring the magic to the muggles
Just dove in the struggle
Not waitin' waist deep
Lickin' kicks off the snairs while you suckas waste beats
Lose your hunger for success once you taste defeat
So I'mma show you how to eat
You gotta let it wet your appetite
Spit it out and rap just tight
Keep a sense of humor and just kick back and laugh at life

(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

That's how I got these panic attacks and frantical raps
that's cold as a chick mixed hispanic with black
But still spit it so hot they'll have to ban it from wax
Or at least press it on that heavy european shit
So you can't want beef when you're a vegan bitch
Props to BLX, I hope y'all see them checks
I'm uppin' woman from the back like a CRX
And real heads can stop waitin' 'cause WE are next
Def J-you-X and Living Legends coming through when I play two sets
Like Shock G and D.U. don't know the half about blowin' up
I call you see too
Treat it like an opening act of movie preview
'Cause everybody in the house came to watch what we do
Since your rhymes are as fly as a fuckin' Emu
So even if I only make MTV2
It's better than me stuck in a rut being you

Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

Quit letting your girl run you life and
Homie be a man
Your ladies not supposed to be your one and only fan
Or your manager
That's a conflict of interest
I expect nothing less from a product of incest
I been fresh
Since my first song in '92
When I got with 3MG we put it down since high school
So mother fuckers, know, how, I, do
I shove this mic down your throat and start speaking into you
And my mic sounds nice, check one
I can sing in the middle of this verse just for fun
Like, ""la la la la laaa""
I know it's off key but when Oh No's on the beat
He can make something even that vile seem sweet
As revenge on your ex-girlfriend who fucked your best friend
While you were drunk passed out in your den
So while you were downin' Hen(essy)
She was goin' down on him

If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober

Definitive Jux presentation
Brought to you by 9th Wonder and Murs

What up though, still givin' a fuck so
Open up your changer and get ready to dump those
Disc of the dudes that be soundin' the same
They get up on TV, steady clownin' for fame
Disrespectin' ancestors that was bound in them chains
But I'm around in the game
So things is bound to change
I'm tryin' to walk that thin line
Between intelligence and ignorance
Have a little fun while makin' music of significance
A nemesis to niggas just bumpin' they gums
I give a fuck where you from
It's where your heart at bitch
You gon' bite, little doggie, or just bark that shit?
A slave to the rhythm, 9th spark that whip
Cause my heart can't quit, I got something to say
Cause these niggas wanna act NWA
Niggaz wit artillery and nothin' to spray
Just some non-right assholes with nothin' to say

(That's right motherfuckers)
(Old salty-ass, sideways-ass motherfuckers)
(Y'all fucked up now, huh? Murs, get em)

I'm from where we leaving running and we hop outta cars
Jump out and beat you down in some new All-stars
No stars and stripes, just bars and pipes
And niggaz just start shootin', they too hard to fight
I'm scarred for life, and charge this mic with bars of fright
Dare any one of you frauds to bite
I'm raw as life with loss of wife and causin' strife
Spittin' sharp wit like I floss with knives
Not contrived or conceited, on your radio repeated
I'm elitist and I leave this Red Hot like Kiedis
I'm a Californicator and a street narrator
Steady runnin' rappers down until they meet their maker
Concrete caretaker to these weak imitators, they a
Screech to my Slater, piece of beef to a gator or the
Heat versus Lakers, I'ma speak to ya later
And let 9th take me out
With techniques and a fader

(What's wrong wit y'all man?)
(The fuck is y'all thinkin' bout?)
(Damn, them motherfuckers is lame man, get ya shit right man)

I'm from the home of Double K, nothin' but trouble gang
K-W-S's, L-T-S's, O-F-A's
And every other crew that used to rack cans and spray
And mob the R-U-D before the M-T-A
So don't hate what I say or talk down when I bust mine
Tryin' to make some green like the Culver city bus line
I'm unsigned and hyped, dump mines on site
This Living Legend gang what you punks rhymin' like
I combine with 9th, sickest with these beats
I mean so sick like he's forgettin' to eat
A hard man to take down like Michael Vick on his feet
And anybody chose me they was thinkin' defeat
I'ma spit with this heat until I get my credit
I'm a verbal martial artist like I'm signed to Shady Records
And you bitches best respect it or I will destroy you

Murs,"Damn time's done changed these thugs do what they like
Some of them be your friends to try and find a new wife
And still hit the block and slang rocks at night
But you could be dead wrong with your pockets right
Contrary to what the legendary B.I.G. had to say
You don't have to sell drugs or make the NBA
It's easy to get a grant and get an MBA
To achieve one goal there's more than one way
Young people on the whole we have lost our way
I don't care what it cost I'm not impressed my nigga
That throwback jersey is a dress my nigga
I remember diamonds used to be girl's best friend
Enslaving Black children with them third world gems
I don't care about your rims, kids ride Big Wheels
Up until they learn balance and it's obvious you haven't
With way more ego than you have true talent



Any white boy who thinks he knows my struggle
Cause he listens to Pac and his adrenaline doubles
Now I ain't got problems with you being yourself
But when you front and use the N word, it just don't help
I might not trip, and your friends'll laugh at you
But I know some real niggaz that'll straight up slap you
Now you could be down, but let's act growed up
Cause we ain't the same color when police show up
My culture's not a trend, being Black is not in
But for you it's just a phase you're gonna have to transcend
While even if I tried, I could never blend in
To society's mainstream, American dream
Yeah, it's all one love, but remember one thing
This music is my life, not a cultural fling
It's an expression of the soul when we dance and sing
And you are blessed to have a chance to even glance the scene

 

Man I do the same music, they stop coming to shows
It's like they scared of the white boys in the front row
First I was like ""so?"" I'mma get my dough
But the numbers kept falling as my fan base would grow
And now I'm concerned so I gotta speak up
First the money was the only thing shutting me up
But now I don't care, don't support me, get mad
Why wouldn't you abort me, my own people have
I feel I should have the scans white rappers have
It's sad but that's the way it is
What's the reason that my album doesn't sell like his?
And don't front like you don't why the hell that is
It's because he's white, you can relate to his face
Through the years you've been taught that Black is unsafe
Plus it's only natural for your own to be embraced
Conscious or subconscious you can't say that ain't the case
Only reason it took so long to take place
Was up until now your only choice was 3rd Bass
Or others like Ice, wasn't really that tight
Now you got some white dudes who can truly rock the mic
You relate to their stories cause you share that past
Question is, why would you listen to MURS' Black ass?
I asked myself for a while but now I finally get it
Good music transcends all physical limits
It's more than something that you hear, it's something that you feel
When the author and experience and passion is real
Used to feel I should be silent, I was scared to do this song
But I want everyone aware of what is going on
Yes it is jazz and yes it is the blues
And yes it is the exact same way they did rock
But I refuse to watch the same thing happen to hip-hop
I refuse to watch that bullshit...

And the coroner's office
Tell 'em there's a dead body
In the corner of Lawson
And Alston, I would proceed with caution
These motherfucka's really think the 'Te done lost it
He sold a couple records now they think he flossin'
But I ain't stopped battling, I just stopped rattling
Off rhymes for free 'cuz y'all were making me nauseous
Understand fucka I'm gon win regardless
I still got the hunger pains from my apartment
When me and 9th were both splittin' cans of StarKist
Arguing about who LP was the hardest
And a hand full of CD's ready to burn
Some real hip hop for your listening nerves

Don't leave your girl round me, heart breaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you cause I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'ma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Kamloops
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to iTunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cause she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, cause you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

Murs,"[Verse 1 - MURS]
First let me ask for forgiveness, since I might go to hell
But I'm addicted to these girls, though where they fuck feel smell
And I been around the world in and out of hotels
Now I'm finally off tour I got some stories to tell
It all started with Mel my first time doin' it
Nervous, couldn't speak, I was scared I might ruin it
Something like a pulse she knew how to take it slow
Knew one false move and I could fuck around and blow
So I went with the flow, it went better than I planned
Finally found something better than cummin' in my hand
They say you come twice the first time, now I understand
I came once inside of her, then I became a man
The next couple of times weren't quite that memorable
Temikha, Glydia must've thought I was pitiful
Bustin' after two minutes, I thought that shit was typical
That was probably why they never got back at a nigga so

[Hook - MURS]
Once upon a time in a land around the way
There lived a couple of girls that would never give me play
Used to wear tight shirts and short skirts everyday
Everytime I tried to hit it they say, no way
Till one fine day in this land of L.A
We finally slipped up and she let me have my way
She kinda turned me out, changed my life I must say
Cause I haven't stopped chasin' these bars to this day

[Verse 2 - MURS]
Now out the city walk come at this iddibittybitch
About 4'7..hmmm..4'11 with a switch
Now lets just say, ehh I think I got it backwards
But big things do come good in small packages
As for actrices in L.A. there's so many
Let me tell you about this freak named Small Town Jenny
After bad auditions, she was guaranteed to hit me
To fuck her on a break when she was waitressing at Danny's
Now there was Umi, female emcee
We talked most of the night about the M-I-see
When it was time for us to get down to be	-I-Z
She let me stick it straight in her asshole, lyrically
I love chicks on e that you meet out at these raves
They use it as an excuse for them to misbehave
I met Rachel in the corner all emotional and mushy
Put my dick on her tongue, glowstick in her pussy
And

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - MURS]
Alright I had a dancer named Candy stripper chicks
Said she only had to dance to get her family out the fix
Fine as hell, but the bitch made me sick
Cause after datin' two months she'd still make me tip
I know a female mexicana by the name of Iliana
She likes me dinky's and a wife beater not pyjama's
Caught her with another dude poppin' up by her casa
But I keep her on the team just to represent la raza
Now Lesbian Liz hasn't called a lot lately
She love to live the legends but she also loves the ladies
I had to let her go, before she led me to crazy
She was lousy in the sack, laid back and hell of lazy
A couple of weeks back it was all about Meretta
Straight up hood rat always beggin' me for cheddar
Had to keep her hair did and her manicure was real
But now I'm fuckin' the corean broad that used to do her nails

Murs,"Everybody out here wanna be hustlers, man
Buit they dont have any idea what I used to do
I used to do anything imaginable
A nigga like me was scared to go to jail
So I'd use my brain and just think up the most outlandish shit
Shit niggas would never do, I used to get dirty
Now these niggas out here just be out here queer hustling
Man these niggas got it all backwards
I'm gonna show 'em how I used to do it

A lotta people wanna knock what we do on my block
But we do what we do cause we ain't got a lot
And you might get shot if your tounges not watched
Casue dudes walk around with hand cannons in their crotch
Fucking up the way they walk, stuck to the strip like scotch
With the top notch Bosch that can cook clean rocks
See times is too hard for us to ever go soft
So the doc got me on prescription strength zoloft
So I can deal with the stress and I won't go off
But I'm on top, won't stop 'til the microphone drop
Rollin' four deep in the Cut like, what?
Hit you up and then roll off, we tryin' to get this dough boss
We don't do diamonds cause my dudes ain't show offs
Tryin' to keep it low so we don't see no cops
Wanna blow up, but I don't wanna go pop
Gotta blow up cause I can't let this dough stop

You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Roll not to be broke and have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie

I used to sell insense bottle 10 cents a dozen
Hit the strip and make 'em flip for a dollar a sack
Everyday before juinor high I bought a six pack
And sold 'em for a buck a piece down by the track
And I never sold crack, did aluminum cans
Used to get laughed at by you and your mans
But I never let it get, stay true to my plans
I used it all for the studio (Now you understand)
In the grocery store parking lot, like can I help you ma'am?
To the car with those bags, used to run that old drag
For a itty bitty tip, maybe a quarter or more
And when I wasn't doing that I was knocking at your door
Like, ""May I speak to the head of the household?""
Then give you the speech on how buying this candys keeping me out the
Streets
Cheap dirt hustles, no glorious tales, but it did keep my black ass from
Going to jail
And I'm a

So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie

I can make a dollar out a dime when I hollar out a rhyme
From the school of hard knocks, so a scholar of the grind
Used to dub tapes myself, claim the quality was fine
But it sounded like shit, lots of hits, hella static
But for three plus two, them shits moved like magic
That's five well spent for true hip-hop addicts
And once they're friends heard it, then they all had to have it
So I took it on the road with little to no baggage
Just some draws and casettes, droppin' jaws with my sets
Once they saw the live show they had to take a piece home
Now I'm almost famous, used to be least known
But not to big to walk the streets alone
Stand in front of any venue witha box of cd's
And these kids love me I stay DTE
Down To Earth, and down to merch at any given moment
If there's money on the block, then where am I, Cause I'm a

Murs,"What up though
It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shut your fat mouth, and listen

[Verse 1]
Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good to them punk fans
When I'm still so hood, so good it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means three times doper than your favorite mc riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I +cum+ to win
While you nothin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
with ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter?, this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
change if you want to change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again
Murs 3:16, let the fun begin",Intro,2004
Murs,"See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lives
I'm a little bit shaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I want to be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'ma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the come on

Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you want to play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad",The Pain,2004
Murs,"Now there's one in my hood off Pico or some shit
Through the years it's been the epicenter for a lot of dumb shit
Let me tell you about this one trip to the store
On the early mornin' tip some time 'round four
I was standing by the magazines readin' a Maxim
When I heard a familiar voice to the the counter dude and ask him
To empty out the register (Nah that can't be Trevor)
Excuse me, Tiny T-Bone from the neighborhood gang
Who if his head wasn't screwed on he would lose his brain
He was with two other dudes, never knew their names
I thought great, it was time for me to shake
But as I headed to the door I heard a voice say (""Wait!"")
When I turned around, he recognized me and I knew it
I was about to leave, that's when that nigga blew it
He lifted up his mask and said (""Hey Murs it's me Trevor."")
I said ""You dumb motherfucker do you use your brain, ever?""
Nevermind, I turned around gave the deuce
Walkin' to the car feelin like Q in Juice
Remember when he went in the bar and Blizzard let him loose?
Anyway here comes this nigga running, big bag of money
He hopped in ride, I said ""You God damn dummy
They got yo ass on tape"" (""But they didn't see my face."")
""Well they got my car and my fuckin license plate
Man get the fuck on"" (""Murs why you gotta hate?"")
""Hate nor love got shit to do with this
You better run for the fives come through this bitch
You know you got two strikes, you better use them new Nikes
To dodge all them blue lights"" He looked and said (""You right."")
Then he bolted up the street
Once he left my slight I gave a sigh of relief
But that was right before I peeped, this dumb motherfucker
Left the bag full of money sitting right there on my passenger seat",Trevor an' Them,2004
Murs,"Now I used to walk with the gun now I walk like a man
And I walk what I talk and I walk never ran
And I never say never but I mean hardly ever
And if shootin' is the solution then you're not that clever
If you don't know shit then you still know better
Human life is so precious it could never be measured
Have you ever had a load of it, cock back the heat
Poppin' on the next nigga while he walkin' up the street
Trigger off safety spacin' an opportunity
These niggaz want to waste me it ain't nothing new to me
Soon as he walked by I was ready to bust
But he just posted up like he was waitin' on the bus
Now I'm all pumped up with a steroid trigger
Cause most of y'all are easy just some paranoid niggaz
Used to walk with a gun but I never did use it
What's the point of holdin' heat if you ain't gon' shoot it
Stupid

It was a late night sunset me and him out
Lookin' at the ladies to come up on some trim
Everybody wildin' out cause the summer's about to end
He had the hypnotic he was missin with the hand
Of that mean green, laid back with the deep lean on low pro shit
That's how we rolled on the scene
Two girls lookin' probably in they late teens
But these days you can't tell but I figured what the hell
So we yell out: Hey girl, they yell back
Maybe two in the front maybe two in the back
But they had this dark tag couldn't see through the black
We roll up ask 'em where their party at
They just start to laugh and I knew it was a trap
But I couldn't roll out cause the strip was so packed
Now I'm lookin at this nigga in this motherfuckin' hat
Start talkin' that bullshit like we was on some bullshit
My nigga used to bang but we ain't know no thug shit
I tried to dismantle it but you know Los Angeles
This nigga kept talkin' so my boy had to handle it
He jumped out the Lex snatched the dude at his hat
I put it in park jumped out to get his back
But as I did that, I heard two shots
I turned to my right and I see my dude drop
Time stopped, couldn't believe what I seen
I was struck by reality when the two girls screamed
I saw his killer stand up put the gun in his jeans
Saw him wince from the pain as the heat burned his waist
Then he turned up the block disappeared without a trace
I remember his face but what I remember most
Was when I got to my knees and held my nigga close
And asked not to leave us in the name of Christ Jesus
But he's gone and all I got left is his blood on my sneakers

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

The day began with me standin' at his grave with his mother
His old girlfriend, his two younger brothers
We said a few words faces covered with tears
How we missed him so much and we wished he was here
Then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone
And we said our goodbyes and they all went home
I thought I'd use this time for me and him to be alone
I broke out the Hen' poured a little out for him
Told him who was gettin' married, who had went to the pen
How the homie named his newborn son after him
But as the sun went down the talk came to an end
So I said a quick prayer, amen
And I shook in the lab plus the well wrote tracks
And I headed up saw the homie Eyezeer
I asked him what he doin' he was way out of bounds
That he had a freak that lived on that side of town
He always kept the heat just in case it went down
A clown, I rolled down my window 'bout to light a ciga-
Hey! Is that that nigga that, hey give me the motherfucking gun
Man, drive around the block and post up for a minute
I hit you on the shirt hit the corner nigga bend it, splendid
Now with vengeance in my grasp
I couldn't dream of a better day for me to catch his ass
Slippin while he dippin into the ride by himself
I slid up behind him in the shadows hell of stealth
He started to breakin' stuff I said I didn't want a dime
Remember what you was doin' last year at this time
He looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise
When I split his face with the glock right before he could reply
He cried as I pressed the heat against his cheek
The I squoze two times for the homie rest in peace

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine
And I thought that's what I wanted until the problem was confronted
Now I'm haunted by remorse that I wished I hadn't done it",Walk Like a Man,2004

Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

Got one waitin', so I gotta go second
Checkin' it with Quan, cran and Goose

He did in the pen like 3 years ago

Murs,"I get the feeling girl, you need someone
To love and appreciate you
To love and appreciate you

Now I was lost, confused, caught up in my feelings
When I first started finding other women appealin'
Thinkin' that the grass is greener on the other side I panicked
Settlin' down so young, wasn't how I planned it
Man it seemed like yesterday, we was all about each other
Never in a million years would I need another lover
But you got too familiar, not like I didn't feel ya
But sayin' something new while we make love would it kill ya?
Calm baby girl, its not an excuse
Cause I probably could have put that gym membership to use
I put on the weight
You put on the brakes
Now we both sit around with that look on our face
You wonder who I'm seeing
And I'm wonder who you're seeing
But we too afraid to ask cause we both got our demons
The reason why we should try to keep this thing together
Cause we stood by each other through all types of weather

I get the feeling girl, you need someone
To love and appreciate you
To love and appreciate you

Now all that takin' you for granted done stop
And the love that we standin' on is solid as a rock
Not but nothing but couple months back when we fought
I couldn't live with myself thinking that you were lost
And now we found common ground
The crib found empty never havin' you around
Now we getting down and the sex is full throttle
Chillin' on the couch watchin' next top model
Don't wanna be nowhere else
It was time for me to put the pimp game on the shelf
You helped with the bills, and I helped with the bills
They say that I'm Whooped, but it's cool I know the deal
I found a real women that'll stay down for me
Shoulda' never had doubts cause I found you early
While my homeboys search, I had what I need
And I'm glad you agree

I get the feeling girl, you need someone

Murs,"And I'm the four-letter word that you don't bleep out
Got a question for you rappers rollin' wit'cha heats out
Is this really where you wanna be when Jesus come back?
Lyin' 'bout your life, over beats comin' whack?
And you say I'm backpack, cause I don't have a gat
Man I just love life, and I'm dealin' with the facts
I'm young, I'm gifted, I'm beautiful and black
And my momma didn't raise no fool like that
I understand that you broke, you tryin' to get money
But you don't start gangbangin' in your mid-20's
Don't know nothin 'bout the beef, or the gang that you claimin'
You ain't even worth namin!
But I got a right hook that'll vacate your Timberlands
Take this outside, set it straight like gentlemen
I do feel the music so I kinda respect it
But don't confuse ill lyrics with real street credit, c'mon

What 'chu gon' do man, ha?
Get knocked out
I'm real official like a referee with a whistle boy
Get it right man
My man Murs yo shut these cats down, holla!

I got my wallet in my pocket and my money in my sock
Cause that's how it be when it's funny on the block
Like it be on TV when these dummies try to rock
With they secondhand flows like they runnin' on a clock
In a one minute cycle, I'm done with the rifles
The tecs, the 9's, the killers, the psychos
Look, now can we party?
And I want a Shirley Temple cause I don't drink Bacardis
But in a minute I'ma probably
Try to holla at a hottie with a, nice shaped body
If she's into what I'm into we should worship at my temple
I'ma, grind from behind as we wind to the tempo
If she break it down slow, then it feel like mo'
That's a Mayfield line for all of y'all who don't know
All I do is have fun and bring life to the fans
And I, don't need a gun cause I'm nice with my hands, c'mon

Nice with my hands dog, never seen the floor man
Ask somebody, check the stats!
Murs man, yo get at these fools though
Let 'em know what's good baby, woo!

We shocked the world last year when, nobody heard of me
My boy he got skills that's like, musical surgery
Me you know the deal I'm a lyrical emergency
We keepers of the real, just consider us security
Of the world, 9th, somethin' like top flight
As long as we in control everything's alright
While the rest will steer you wrong with them songs that they thought up
I wrestle with these words but I'm never gettin' caught up
In the drama and the BS
Jumped up out the underground, you know I gotta be fresh
Rhymes runnin' through my mind all day, I press eject
I gotta lay 'em down on these beats cause they need wreck
Yes, I'm back for the title
And I brought an iron fist, just to smack all your rivals
Woulda thought I ran track, the way I ran through my rivals
Man I swear I'm the truth, slap my hand on the bible
Let's go",Murray's Law,2006
Murs,"I'm a, hood legend, you should feel threatened
Front I'ma show you what's good in a second
The best in the business, I mean what is it?
The dopest MC to walk talk it and live it
A wide bright screen with a blockbuster signature
Every new line I speak should be in cinemas
Champion sound, I win with words
Like you finally talked your girl into sleepin' with a friend of hers
Oh yeah, I'm off on a good one
Momma's so proud of what her boy from the hood done
Got off the meat and I got my mind right, I
Got out these streets I got my grind like I
Got on these beats I gotta come tight it's
Gotta be me, it's gotta be 9th
Your boy dropped some stuff and it was probably nice
But they need a little help, and a lot of advice
Quit while you're ahead, you ain't seein' no bread and
Don't sleep on us, you can sleep when you're dead
And grateful, you didn't live life hateful
Change for the better like the weather in April
Food for the soul, go ahead and grab a plateful
A heart full of hate, is a waste and disgraceful
Uh, don't ingest, turn your stomach
When a brother only wanna see another brother plummet
Come with cha best and you can lose like the rest
Straight shots when I shoot how we do on the West
Yeah!

You know who we might be, man myth or M-C
But Murs sums it up best now, wouldn't you agree?
I, stuck to the plate like it's And1 and straight
Sew the mic around your neck and then bounce it off your face
With grace, the ace in the hole, replacin the old
Cause the new generation got a taste for some soul
Hold on to opinions 'til I tell you to have one
That mic wasn't hot until the spot 'til I grabbed one
Off the stand now it's off the hook
And when the beat is this nuts, then I'm off the books
Meaning, off the head, freestylin' makin' bread
And I shoulda been in a movie but I made my own instead
Still pioneering with this independent hustle
And your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle
For the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in remembrance
Of every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements
Innocent 'til proven guilty
Should I die don't look for the dude that killed me
Look for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow
Live every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow
And you can holla out my name from the top of the game
And since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same
For if a soul is avenged through the deeds of a friend
Then success has always been the best form of revenge
THE END",Murray's Revenge,2006
Murs,"What up though?
Murs, 9th Wonder
Murray's Revenge!
Y'all know what time it is
Shut your fat.. nah
Watch your mouth and lower your tone and keep your hand on that cell phone
We back

Now my day in the sun has come, the one chosen
To break up the ice that got the rap world frozen
Speak that slang that'll heat up the game
Now, roll down your window turn the beat up, it bang
Feelin' the breeze
Let the world know they still makin' real MC's
So please, make a call, tell your friend, tell the hood
That we back and revenge never sounded so good
Questionin' 9th about choppin' vocal samples
I chop you in your throat 'til you choke on the answer
Nice with this mic since I was broke and handsome
'Til I get my respect I'm holdin' dope for ransom
From the West coast, everything I flow's an anthem
A&R's who slept are now throwin' a tantrum
Hand 'em over boys, your jewels and your girls
Bow down to the sound cause ""Murs Rules the World""
I'm better than your favorite rapper
But it don't take much these days for you to master the mic
Most of these rappers trapped in the hype
They makin whole albums, only half of it's tight
So they never really have an impact on your life
That's why ""3:16"" was genius
We all connected through this ""Minstrel Show"" man, I mean it
Until my days end I'm gettin' paid my friend
Without pimpin' my soul, the gangster limpin' was old
So I ""Walk Like a Man"" and, talk to my fans
Clocked a few grand but you gotta understand
I got a little money and I, coulda bought a chain
But my momma woulda killed me, simple and plain
Exchange foreign currency, for legal tender
Now I'm back to end the era of the great pretender
So pull your pants up and, turn that noise down
It's Murs and 9th Wonder on the second go 'round",Murs Day,2006
Murs,"Hey, you know what?
That lil' stuff between your legs ain't gon' keep me
And neither is you callin' me every five minutes
Like you need to know what I be doin'
I'm at where I'm at, and I'mma be where I'mma be
And that's about all you need to know
And you need to use your inside voice when you talk to me
'Cause all that raisin' your voice to me in front of your friends
In the car on your cell phone,
It's not hot, it's not cute, and it ain't gettin' you nowhere
And it's about to get you fired
So, calm it down

She thought that making me wait was the way to get me hooked
Now, fellas we all know that's the oldest trick in the book
What you do, you wait around, wait until she break down
One day at the crib, she gonna let you break ground
Soon found out she was so real with it
One year, no love man who would deal with it
Me? I fell for it, romancin', financin'
A couple years back I would've told you there was no chance in hell
But oh well, here I was
That's how it be when you're falling in,
Uhm, I wouldn't say that
Well, maybe it was
Them trips to the Gentleman's Club...oh well
They made me feel like I was givin' but I was gettin' back
Man that story 'bout the cow and the milk ain't a fact
'Cause if you wait too long, the milk goes sour
And I like my love hot, no more cold showers

I'm on them other girls, I don't want you in my would
And there's not a single thing that you can do, do
You're playin' on my phone, and you won't leave me alone
I think it's finally time for you to get a clue, clue
You told all your friends about the time we used to spend
And I'm 'bout to run it all throughout your crew, crew

Ooh, I called Pam
You know the one who always liked me
You tried to tell her that I had a drip just to spite me
But she didn't buy, guess what?
We're down to tryin'
And we did a lot more than kiss, I can't deny it
I took her to the Hyatt, tied her to the terry
Took Tasha to the Hyatt, oh yeah I went there again
And starin' in my windows, it's just not hot
Always knew you were a freak, never knew you liked to watch
And I'mma call the cops next time you come to my job
And my new girlfriend, she from the hood, she kind of suave
When she take out them earrings, crunch time--punch time
Believe me, I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time
I came home late, didn't call, wait that's not the point
She gets in another fight, she goin' back to the joint
So, don't waste your time, we both know you can't fight
Now, quit hidin' in the bushes and go home, goodnight

Yo, I knew this silly chick was diggin' me
I told her I had a girl, but if you keep it on the low, you can get with me
See I done switched the game up
Now she ask when I'mma leave her
Leave her? You know the answer last time that came up

Why you keep stressin'? Just keep undressin'
This a headache, man I swear I never learn my lesson
Told myself about these undercover villains
All these silly chicks end up always catchin' feelin's
And what am I 'sposed to do when a late night freak in the jeep
End up gettin' a little too close to you
Close to who? Close to me?
Nah, my little thing on the side, this ain't how it's 'sposed to be
Supposed to hit it (hit it), quit it (quit it), and hit it again
Chill for a while then flip it again
But she started acting crazy I split to the ends
She told her girl how I get down, now I'm hittin' her friend

Alright, alright I ain't getting out of bed today
9 to 5 to survive, there's gotta be a better way
Waking up early to punch in the clock
How I'm lookin' grown man with my lunch in a box
But my kids need socks and shoes,
I'm walking through the office (boss yelling)
Who you talking to don't you know on the streets I would've
Never mind, the past is the past I gotta leave it behind
But man back on the block I was a bonafide hustler
Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us I though I was gone
Could've cried thinking now I'd miss my son being born
But I was blessed, beat the case now I'm trying to reform
But this white folks make it so hard to move on
You gotta jump through hoops, anger management groups
But the fact I'm still standin' here today is proof that

And today I feelin brand new, I got nothing to lose, get out my way move

On to the next, it was all about sex
When I first met my little baby girl annette
She was standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Eyes collard green lean thicker than a pork chop
(stop) cause I don't eat swine
But this girl was so divine, that I had to make her mine
Called upon her a few times, she thought I was funny
Fell for it like a dummy, it was all for the money
(j-eah) growing up in the hood,
You would think I'd understand, but I never understood
Why she rarely came around when my dough wasn't good

Now you can call it puppy love, cause I got dogged out
Now in all my notebooks, I got her name crossed out
But she lost out, I just lost profit
When she left me in the cold, heart broke like my pockets and

You know the days when you just got the blues
All stressed and depressed from just watching the news
No matter what good you do, it seems you always get screwed
Got you caught up in your feelings, now you off in a mood
Shake that attitude and do what you can
Set a couple goals, follow through with your plans
Time wait for no man, and tomorrows not promised
So if she's still alive shoot a call to your momma
Cause the fighting and the drama, its just not worth it
Nobodies perfect ain't none of us worthless
We all got a place and we all got a purpose
Now I'm not taking y?all to Sunday service
But you clap your hands as you stand up and work it

Murs,"I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you, girl, but not see you at all
I wanna make up, but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right
""Sitting here waiting on you""

I hate you, you hate me, but still can't escape ""we""
And all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart broke, lovestruck
Telling y'all, ""It ain't me.""
Life without you, girl, is something that I can't see
I ain't gon' lie, say, ""I don't get lonely""
But there's only so much, I could kick it with the homies
And somebody told me that you already moved on
I broke up with you, you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now, at least wait a couple weeks
Got me looking like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks, but it feel like you still there
No matter how I clean, I'm still finding your hair
Or some shit you forgot, or I'm standing in that spot
Where you came so hard, I didn't think that you would stop
But, quiet as it's kept, I know you miss me just a little
Washed my sheets when you left but still smell you on my pillow

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You ain't call me last night, what you trying to be? Strong?
You'll call yourself stupid when you finally hear this song
Cause I would've took you back, I was waiting to, in fact
All you had to do was holler, girl, I would've just collapsed
And fell into a trap and started to relapse
And your ass never called so it just never happened
Now I'm thinking Jasmine, Tanya, Cheraine
Some ex's I can call that'll probably ease the pain
I tried to follow through, but I wound up calling you
Hanging up before a ring, girl, it's really all on you
But you wanna get into it, make me mad, push my buttons
Got us tripping over little stuff that don't mean nothing
I'm sick of the suffering, the fighting, the fussing
What happened to the love in the late night discussions
'Bout children, and family, the future, the plan
And now it's all over cause you couldn't understand me

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

Started missing you again last night
'Til I remembered all the reasons that your ass love to fight
It's like, dude
I really wanted this to work
But you, had to get your shit together first
And what's worse
I really wanted you to stay
But I needed you to leave cause we was fighting everyday
All right, not everyday, I know that's a lot on it
We was supposed to be companions
We was more like opponents
Don't this song make you wanna do it one more time?
Could I still be the only dude that's on your mind?
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm hoping that you not
I would take you back quick, girl, without a second thought
But I'm caught up in my pride and I can't make the call
Didn't want to break up, just a break, that's all
It's been a long time, I know I probably shouldn't have left you
Cause your the only woman that I wanna sleep next to

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You say you're sick of me and I say I'm sick of you
But we crazy 'bout each other, girl, what we gon' do?
Said I needed you to leave, but I hate to see you go
Can't make up my mind, girl, I just don't know
I wanna make this work but I'm sick of the struggle
Girl, what I gotta do to make you realize I love you?
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I just don't feel you
But find another man, and I just might kill you

You gotta do you and let it do what it does
I'mma be happy
Fame won't trap me
Catch me doin' this for the money then slap me
There's more to life
I'm better than that
I'm trying to lift you up instead of settin' you, settin' you back (echos)

It's good game man
I wouldn't tell you nothing that wasn't good for you though
That wasn't going to help you grow

Man

[Michael Jackson:] ""Can it be I stayed away too long""

[Murs:]
From my supporters and my fans, man, I know y'all been waitin'
Now it's finally here and
Thank you for your patience
The world's gone crazy
Since we last spoke
Bloodshed and war
The absence of hope
Shootin' after school
Economy's a joke
Homies on heroine
Homies on coke
But can you even blame 'em when they only tryin' to cope (Damn)
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
All these rappers wanna talk about is guns and dope
Don't they realize, we all at the end of our rope
The future all depends on the power of our quotes
The power of a pen
The power of a vote
The power of your words
The power of your voice
The power of America's the freedom of choice
We choose to do nothin'
We lose and we sufferin'
""Can it be""
That it's time to do somethin'
It's not socialism
It's not communism
It's lovin' each other, realize there's no difference
It's positive movement
Gradual improvement
When no one else does
Believe you can do it
My heart is a speaker
I bleed this music
The beat's in my blood
I must transfuse it
If it wasn't for this
Yeah, I just might lose it (Damn)
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
My god daughters Nadia, Simone
Diana know when not, our father's ever comin' home
Claim by the streets with them other war zone
Tears in my eyes as I'm writin' this song
Mommy workin' two jobs, tryin' to do it on her own
No matter where I go
Or how far I roam
Know that I love and you'll never be alone
""Can it be"" Damn, y'all so grown

[Murs:]
And a, and a wise man told me, man, like (""You don't have to worry cause I'm coming"")
Life is like a table
Full of like glasses of water (""Back to where I should have always stayed"")
And your job is to keep 'em all full
You know what I'm sayin'
So everyone's happy (""And now, I've heard the maybe to your story"")
But
At the same time, you gotta keep your pitcher full of water
So you could fill everybody else up (""And it's enough love"")
And it's like (""For me to stay"")
Damn!

""Can it be I stayed away too long""

From the independent hip hop scene
Now they talkin' like
How I'm not a hip hop fiend
Needle in my arm, can't they see I'm O.D.'in
You'll never take the strife from this triple O.G. in
I blaze trails
Created festivals
Lost fifty G's on Paid Dues, is that acceptable
What? I'm not down for the cause
""Can it be"" (Hold on, Mike) I'm a need a few bars
I could've done the Nas and scream, ""Hip Hop Is Dead""
I got up off my ass and I did somethin' instead
Signed with the devil, brought the scene up a level
Killed the beast from within, I'm a born again rebel
Tryin' to save the youth
From the way of the gun
And if I only save one, then my job is done
So you can say what you will, but you should judge me none
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
From my God, from my faith, as I move place to place
Times I thought, ""If I could just die, it'd be great""
Drop on the spot, man, I didn't even care
I stopped talkin' to you, I stopped sayin' prayers
Numb from the liquor and the anti-depressants
Pressure from the label, studio stressin'
Almost lost my passion to persue this profession
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
From myself, from my soul, when I'm out on the road
I give so much shout to these kids, I don't know
I thought I lost you, with no one to talk to
But you're the one that open up these doors that I walk through
I can't fault you, only forgive you
I'm the only one that seen the pain that you been through
The drama, the struggle that built all your issues
""Can it be I stayed away too long""

[Murs:]
The drama, the struggle, that built all these issues
Is all just to make sure they never forget you

Murs,"What up dog? It's Murson
It seems like nobody's trying man
There's kids dying in Sudan and nobody cares man
At least I'm trying, man
Look, don't ever let the fact that you can't be perfect
Stop you from doing your best 'Murs for President'

Unless we try the innocent'll die
You can't close your eyes, keep living in a lie
Look, we not helpless, we not hopeless
Said a prayer for the homie whose locked up and wrote this

He got to get out and change his ways
While I'm looking for a way to explain these days
It's trying time so I'm trying to rhyme
But so many fascinated with this life of crime, hah

Look, I'm dying to be different, down to die to make a difference
Music for the movement with a message, uplifting
Went from set trippin' to trips around the world
Opportunities are oysters, you might find a pearl

You can't be scared to take that chance
'cause if you rather knock twice then you're late for the dance
You gotta move with urgency, assert with certainty
Ask me if I'm set to serve, I say, certainly

Higher than the kite, I'm high off life
At the height of my career, a high priest on mikes
I'm anti thug and anti drugs
Brought peace to the party and got anti love

But haters so antiquated, I anticipated
Accepted it internally at night interpolated
He chopped it up and laid it in a session and then he played it
I wrote, recorded to it, now look what we created

A hot mess, I'm hot off the press
You yesterday's news, dude, you just not fresh
You cold coffee, you wet cigarettes
I'm a shot of Espresso and hot morning sex

Early to rise and the last to fall
The best thing for black youths is the basketball
Word to Kurtis Blow, you gotta know the breaks
And if you don't know your history, I know your fate

Uh, look, been here a minute, be around a while longer
Every rhyme invented, my style got stronger
Grayskull Powers when I spray soul showers
While you battle rap cats, just lay low cowards

Oh, you mad 'cause I'm stylin' on you
Love songs one minute, then I'm whilin' on you
That's the pain, you gotta love and appreciate
I'm a bad man, you silly girls need to get it straight

Hah, small guys, denying this is my world
Your girlfriend call herself a dark skinned, white girl
Got a nice beat, man, come on
He hear me in the sample before he even through the drum on

Run on sentence, I'm the best period
He pull the track out, I'll black out I'm not hearing it
Nada, nothing, the negative zone
And if you can't do better, you should let it alone, hah

I want it more than you, I want it, I want it right now
I'm wanted in 48 statees for this thou
It's sicker than a syringe that's streamlined with strychnine
Vegan diet, healthy heart and soul with a sick mind

Inclined to flip split minds when I spit rhymes
So go ahead kick yours and hope I don't kick mine
A 50 yard line against the wind through the uprights
While you just choke and can't win 'cause you uptight

Hah, he came to the game with two emcees
Back when people said you can't make beats on PCs
Internet haters, major labels be damned
Soon produced the full blown threat for the man

Now his phone blowin' up, he can't hold it in his hand
A few months back them fools didn't understand
I was Mary J and Erica, Jean Grey, etc
But the name's 9th Wonder and he crushing all competitors

I cross train, toss brain fuel on hot tracks
Burn in intelligent infernos, you got that?
I speak clear like the sample is in triplicates
Get every crooked cop in Los Angeles to handle this

Insane, inspired, insider street analyst
Questioning authority who don't know what the answer is
The voice is proof the choice of the youth
Forensic evidence say the boy is the truth

I haven't gave it to ya, I'm tryin' to save till ya
Least expect it and make it something major for ya

Cause your not here anymore.
I can still see you walking out the door.
Your just a memory of what used to be.

If I did it would be different believe me.
Its easy to say baby I'm a change.

We in Idaho one night and Portland, Oregon the next day
Up in Anchorage Alaska and then Australia for three weeks
It's like this

I got my bags packed
Backpack sittin' by the front door
Ipod, lab top, socks and drawers
The stuff that you need when you're out on tour
Home for one month then gone for two more

Hear you cryin' in your sleep
Taste the tears on your cheek
It's sweet but it's bitter
The emotion that it triggers
Makes me miss my woman and her home cooked dinner
I wish I never had to leave
Perform for these crowds with my heart on my sleeve
But you still believe
And they say you naive
So I gotta keep the faith with every breath that I breathe
It needs to be said that it's just not easy
Every night different city, different women want to please me
I keep it true and I walk on through
Say my prayers and go to sleep after talkin' to you

Two hundred days on the road
But I guess I'm addicted
Because I really start to miss it
Don't know what I'm chasin' but I know I gotta get it
It ain't about fame or a couple of dames
Or a million different faces with a thousand different names
It ain't about praise or the hands being raised
To me it just a job and I'm glad that it pays
And when the road starts to call in the spring and the fall
If I don't holla back then my skin starts to crawl
And when I get that itch I gotta pack my bags
Dress up or go home
Hotels and jet lag
Can't lose my religion cause it's all that I have
I keep runnin' worldwide till I run out of gas

Murs,"So I'm at the barbershop
And we talking about this new generation of hip-hop
And how, how lost you all are man
But y'all have no science
So here you go

The systematic knowledge of the physical world
Gained through observation and experimentation
Usually beginning with a hypothesis
Or what some may call an estimation
Record your results from a series of tests
And what your left with is a theory at best

Now let me give my hypothesis, an educated guess
On why my people on the whole seem to be such a mess

Genocide, the deliberate extermination of a race, culture, or an entire nation
Centuries ago they brought us here on a boat
Enslaved us, beat us til our spirit was broke
Then they gave us freedom and a little bit of hope
Then they killed our leaders and they gave us dope (crack)
From the C.I.A. by way of Nicaragua, shipped to Rick Ross, he’s the black godfather
Now Oscar Blandon was his known supplier, he snitched on Rick so he could retire
Ratted on Ricky so he got out quickly, now this is where the situation gets a little sticky

Not a citizen of the U.S.A. he got released and got hired by the D.E.A.
Then he got his green card by the I.N.S.
But that should’ve never happened due to previous arrests
See our government seems to think that there’s a difference
Between powdered cocaine and crack, for instance
You get five years for five grams of crack
But in the powdered form you have a hundred times that
Now who has the rock, and who has the powder?
Who’s the oppressed and who has the power?
They want you to fail so you wind up in jail
You know how much they make while you sitti'n in that cell?
Billions of dollars for inmate facilities
You sell yourself back into slavery willingly
It's not black and white, it’s so much more
It’s the rich stayin rich and the poor stayin poor
The poor white’s meth, the poor black’s crack
It’s not about race and once you realize that, we as a nation are free to move on
And become one people, a movement, strong

Now black people weren't the first to be enslaved
We were just the first to be treated this way
No education you were killed if you could read
So you hid your intellect if you wanted to succeed
And what happens to a lie when you livin' it
You lose sight of who you are and start forgettin' it
So many of us to this day act ignorant
A mere shadow of our former magnificence
Wellfare
No independence we become victims dependin' on the system
Looking for a handout waiting on some help
Toiling on the past feeling sorry for your self
But you do what you can to make it out the trap
And that right there is the origin of rap
It wasn't always played on every radio station
It was us makin the best out of a bad situation
Inner city schools stopped teaching us instruments
We took turntables and started flippin' it
Stole electricity from the street lights
Plugged it into a system and made the beat hype
There was a mic but MC's weren't rulin'
It was more 'bout what the DJ was doin'
He say a few words (GO GO) to keep the party movin'
The beat boys dancin' to the breaks and the grooves
An the break was the part where the record broke down
Where it was just a drum and a couple of sounds
You had two records you could go back and forth
To keep the groove goin' cause the break was so short

Now if that aint' science I don't know what is
The ingenuity of these young black kids
The Bronx New York Central Recita
Kool Herc earth hip-hop true believers
(Theory) Adversity produces opportunity
Anythings accomplished through strength and unity
The fate of the world is in the hip-hop commuity

She was only fifteen, in love with bad R&B
She had to have vision because she saw the star in me
Encouraged me to write about the drama in my life
To most it seemed strange like something wasn't right
I used to fall a victim to them lunch room comedians
Something like an Outkast, started smokin' weed and then
I sorta fell into my own
Kinda felt at home when behind a microphone
But on the bus ride home
That didn't mean a thang
Harassed by thugs, on the corners they would hang
I got banged on
I got beat down
Carrying a golf club, walking up the street now
They respect me
They call me crazy
At least I'm not gettin' punked out on the daily
And when I look back I wouldn't change a thing at all
Where do you think I found the strength to be speakin' to y'all?

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

God is love then hatin' is Satan
Zen-type patience, got me sittin' here waitin'
On the day when it's okay to love
When black men won't pretend that they are thugs
When teachers and doctors are treated like celebrities
You can get a job even if you got a felony
Check out my melody, let's live in harmony
We in this together, no man has autonomy
No man is an island, immune to the violence
This rap race is no place to raise a child in
What's wrong with smilin'? What's wrong with peace?
What's wrong with squashin' beef before they label you deceased?
Swallow your pride before you choke on your issues
I know you got family and folks that'll miss you
So don't misuse this gift you've been given
This life's but a dream you are blessed to be livin'

And basically man, I'm just a dude who tries to do right
You know I try to make my tomorrows better than my yesterdays
Without hurting anyone else in the process
Cause if you leave the world a better place than it was when you got here, then we all win

Now, there's birth and there's death but the space in between
Is where the journey takes place and you give it all meaning
There's waitin' on us all, there's no need to pretend
No feet are in the feeling where you fear in the end
All good things come to it, walk, don't run to it
At times you want to end it all yourself, don't do it

Be the one that stand up and shocks this system

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around

Now periodically I would see
Old girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
By not preaching to me, but speaking to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded

Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy

She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressing hippie
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and ""real"" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her

But the desire to rule
In the pursuit of pure power is the path of the fool

Rob us blind, steal it, just the way it is
Take you for a gang of loot, twenty dollars got you, I ain't?
Now tell me why's that, they blame the lies in rap
But what about the medium bullshit? They disguising that
How we got access to ammo and any size of gat
But we can't get a decent school for us to knowledge at
It's called the block madness
They know they turn us into crime addicts
On the block chasing superficial status
Now do the mathematics, how many of us die in war
On the street or for all who sleep and score

I was out in AZ chilling with my nigga Ro'
We was zoning out
Couple dirty jokes, had the music up
A little smokey smoke, he was getting blue as fuck
Stuff
Back in the day, you know, times was kinda rough
Way back, I was nowhere near my 30's
Rap wasn't paying the bills, we was riding dirty
Two pounds of brown weed, straight from [?]
We was riding slow, watching for the federals
Shoot, how can I forget, we had a half an ounce of shrooms

That's when the sheriff car came riding by
We wasn't speeding, he didn't have a reason
He still pulled us over, now I'm fearing for my freedom
""Oh shit! The shrooms! Hurry up and eat them""
He took half and I took half and threw the bag under the seat and uhm
""Hello officer, what will you be needing?
License, registration, I'm sure you wanna see em""
""Sir, we already know who you are
Mr. Carter could you please step out of the car?""

""Mr. Carter could you please open up the trunk?""
I said ""Huh? Are you sure that's what you what?""

I went to the trunk, and opened it up
And from the look on his face I could tell that we were fucked
Ronin jumped up
He said ""Officer, that is not his weed""

Knocked the cop off his feet and grabbed his two piece
I stood for a second, thinking ""Should I run with him?""
The cop stood up, I stuck my foot out and tripped him
He fell, and hit
Then he sunk to his knees and bled
He passed out, face covered in red
""Oh my God! Is he dead?""
And then he started he crying
No small feet, he wasn't a small guy
How he fit a pig in the trunk, hogtied

In a '67 cutlass we was riding through the desert
Looking for a place to bury this new treasure

I dreamt of this day ever since I was a small child
And when it finally came the sky was filled with rain clouds

I teared up as we started to say our vows
No more ""me"", it's all about ""us"" now
And the children we bring into this union
Never thought I'd live to see my dreams come true, man

Look, all I know is marriage, pops and moms did it
Grandparents did it, both stayed committed

Of seeing myself married to Hip-Hop without a queen
And I refuse to be that old, lonely dude at home watching porn
Forty plus lurkin' around the college dorms
And uh, speaking of kids, I got a kid on the way

Daddy ain't home, he selling dope on the corner
His best friend been turned informer
He got them clacks coming from Arizona
To you it's a movie, for him it's just normal
Enormous pounds of white
Child of the night
Counting 50 G's to himself every night
Racks on racks on racks
Hit the strip club, they show him straight to the back
That's the life, that he lives
Whenever in Miami he just live at live
Give it 3 years and he a Rico case
Ain't no telling how many years he gon' face
Coulda been me cause we from the same neighborhood
Every time he offer me some work I just say I'm good

And arrest us for trafficking like a sick joke
It ain't a option for the rich folk
But for us it's live broke or flip dope
Live broke or flip coke

Forget hope and flip coke

Murs,"Days going by, I'm losing friends
You never know when it's gon' end
Some in the pen, some underground
Souls that are lost, hope they are found
If heaven's a place, I hope that they're there
Wherever they are, they know that I care
It's coming for me, so I get prepared
Look in my eyes, the fear isn't there
'Cuz I been aware, I live in the shadows
The valley of death, where I do my battle
One day I'mma lose and then I'll be gone
I'm making these songs, so that I live on

I miss Mikey cuz, that's the way it is
You start to lose your friends and you don't wanna live
You gotta give it time, and the pain will pass
I miss Walker and Caloo and the homie Poo
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life and make each day your favorite one
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life

You're put on this Earth for however long
It favors the weak and never the strong
They say it's a game, so I play along
Some say I'm king, some say I'm pawn
Live from the soul to the break of dawn
You never know the day you'll be gone
No matter the odds, I'm taking 'em all
Some say I'm right, some say I'm wrong
Wanna escape the path that you're on?
Erasing the pain by waving a wand
Some roll a J, some hit the bong
I let the beat play, then I make a song

I miss Mikey cuz, that's the way it is
You start to lose your friends and you don't wanna live
You gotta give it time, and the pain will pass

The perfect girl from Cali
Met her at a party in [?] in the Valley
She said her name was Leti, that's short for Leticia
I said my name is Nick, quite a pleasure to be meetin' ya
Perhaps if you have the time, I wouldn't mind to be treatin' ya
To dinner and a movie because I really wanna be with ya
She giggled just a little, put her number in my phone
I text a little later to make sure she made it home

I don't care what your friend say
Estas siempre en mi mente
So I can't let you get away

Tell me that you're never gonna leave me

She was half Salvadorian, the perfect Californian
I picked her up and dropped back off at her door at 10
Now walking back to my car all cool
And I heard a voice say ""who the fuck are you?""
I said ""man, you just seen me drop Leti off""
He balled up his fist acting like he bout to set it off
His homie rolled up, looking just like him
And just when I thought I was about to fight them
(WHOOP)
That's when the cops rolled up
Smelling like some sausage and coffee and donuts
But I'm happy that they saved me because it could of got crazy
That's when Leti texted me saying ""I love you baby""

Me vuelves loco
But you act like you don't know, though
Estoy obsesionado un poco
I'm always looking at your photos

Can't believe that you wore those
Ahora estas en peligro
You better never leave me solo

Oh, mi corazon

How could it ever work, she was brown and I was black
Went to her crib and her brothers pulled a strap
She sent me pictures of her ass so fat
Now I'm thinking damn I gotta go back

Murs,"Jogging through the junkyard, kicking the can
Never would I think I had the world in my hand
17 times, circumnavigate the globe
A traveler’s tradition, my religion is the road
Broke the mold, explored all the options
The quickest way to curate the cash, so I clocked in
On the job, no training wheels
Told my mama I'mma make it cause I say I will
Till the wheels fall off
Yes yes, y’all, 'till the beat it don’t stop
Between a rock and a hard place
Came up out the ghetto with my boys, no Scarface
But is my mind playing tricks?
If the world is really mine how I ain’t got shit?
Still they stop and they frisk
But it’s never gonna change till we stop and resist

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

Welcome to the world of drug dealers
Comic books, white girls, and real niggas
Skateboards, bandanas, and malt liquor
Japanese cartoons and straight killers
They tell us get out the ghetto and get rich
But when you really a rebel you don’t fit
We all tryna find our niche
Got to grab it by the throat and make the world your bitch
It’s the American way
Plug into the drive and let the narrative play
We obsessed with nothing but the best shit
Do it on your own or be a drone with a death wish
Defy definition, repress repetition
Get money, get high, get sex, the addiction
The depression, the stress, the affliction
Get ready, get set, go, we on a mission

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more

They had a rally for police brutality up at the park
But when we killing ourselves don’t nobody want to march
We got to start to take a look in the mirror
If we don’t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us
If black lives matter then black lives matter
And the color of the killer shouldn’t even be a factor
Most of these rappers ain’t equipped to lead
Cause most of these rappers illiterate, can’t read
This is educated street music for the educated street movement
It’s fucked up what the police is doing
But motherfucker look what we doing

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more

Murs,"Once upon a time there was a one man gang
Who never ran from anyone or sold cocaine
OGs in the city all knew his name
So here's a little story about the gang that he claimed

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog crip
When he get up out the pen better hope he don't trip
Teriyaki or pastrami, he was always in some beef
A legend to this day, they talk about him in the streets
It's not a real hood, it's something that he made up
To piss gang-bangers off cause he never gave a fuck
He wore white Pro Wings, with pink and green strings
And dare anybody on the shore to say a thing
Seen him knock a lot of dudes out with one swing
By his side he always kept the baddest bitch you ever seen
Made his first million by the age of seventeen
Running credit card scams, never touched a triple beam
He was the king, everybody tried to trip on him
They would get confused when he Okey Dog Crip on 'em
Most of the time they would just start laughing
But they all got knocked out quick just for asking

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
Once knocked a nigga out, and he broke his own fist like this
In L.A you get hit up every day
The homie had to come up with something different to say
He like ""no matter what I say they gon' always want to fight
I'd rather get in to it over something that I like
And the one thing I love in this world above all
Is the Teriyaki burger that they make at Okey Dog""
All he needed was a cause that he could get behind
He was always down to squad cause he won every time
Ever since we was little he could fight very well
Seen him whoop a grown man and we was only 12
Kept to himself unless they bothered him first
But like I was saying at the top of this verse
He busted up his hand on a bitch nigga's head
All because he walked up to my homeboy and said

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
He pulled out a chopper, told me focus in on this
This can make a man brave, this could make a man a slave
And once you pull it out ain't too many standing in your way
Trigger in your hand, you gotta understand
A lot of men use arms cause they ain't got hands
The shooter is respected much less than the gladiator
If you kill a nigga then his homies gon' get at you later
You square up, win some, lose some
I need to save the day like John Witherspoon, son
Homie's almost out after 8 to 10 years
But I'mma say something that he might hate to hear
Look, now that I'm a grown man
30 something years and I'm out here tryna throw hands
It's green light for me to blast a motherfucker
So you better think twice before you ask a motherfucker

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)

Ever since they busted out the super sport
Brevity, levity, bitter I could never be

Of all the crazy shit I be saying when we fight
Shout a kite to my nigga locked up, now Reece home
Making music for the kids, bitch we grown
Put your phone down, look me in the eye
Or you can talk that shit to another guy
I swear to God I would kick you in the button fly
And jump up and down on your skull 'til you fucking die
Y'all probably want to dance so ignore me
That club life ain't ever been for me
You basic bitches just bore me
If I got to buy you a drink you can't afford me

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say

I got two shots left in my twenty-two two step
Two shots left in my twenty-two two step

Deuce-deuce in my tennis shoe
Hood nigga brought a burner to the interview
Might catch a beef on the bus home
Tell them gang-bang bullies get the fuck gone
In my zone with a brand new playlist
Walked right past my ex, didn't say shit
Then I changed my mind like, ""Ay bitch!""
""Tell your new boyfriend he can't fake this!""
Spent my last check on some new kicks
The rest at the movies on my new chick
I got fired on some bullshit
Snitch, fuck-boy that I never should've fooled with
And I ain't ever wrote a résumé
But I had my cousin make me one yesterday
I need more hours and some better pay

A motherfucker put some money on my head
Cold sweat, wide awake in my bed
I guess I shoulda’ took my meds
I’m so sedated, self medicated
Hoping that the threats on my life are never predicated
If this is the price of fame, I should of hesitated
I don’t wanna die in the streets, I’m too educated
The type of shit you need a vest for
The type of shit that can’t be fixed with high test scores
Getting pressed more, as the fame builds
But my shrink keep prescribing me the same pills
Can’t kill a motherfucker just for lookin’ at me
Even though I know his ass is plottin’ when he lookin’ at me
Statute of limitations on a murder is
Non-existent, if I hit him, I’ll be serving years

This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead
This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead

For years I've been having dreams that I get shot
Then them niggas go runnin’ up the block
Me and Terry just chillin’ at the spot
They pull up in the cutlass, start bustin’, then I drop
Start running, I collapse on the corner
Neighbors start yellin’, somebody call the coroner
Standing over me, blood on my denim
Kinda like Omar did Snoop when he hit ‘em
Wreath wrapped up in blue ribbon
Nobody at the funeral, knew that I was crippin’
Well I’m not, but on the block, who isn’t?
If you kick it’ on the spot, then it don’t make a difference
You can get shot just because you with em’
And every cop thinkin’ that you fit the description
Gettin’ older as my life get’s shorter
Livin’ with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

On the side, but your main chick tried to hate
Let me tell you a story about my situation
I got caught up with this chick from a radio station
The thirteenth caller won a ticket to my show
At night is where I saw her there in the front row
She had big D cups and a very small waist
I looked into her eyes and wondered how did she taste
She came backstage to take a flick for the gram
She whispered in my ear and put my dick in her hand
She said, ""Do you have plans for later on tonight?""
I said, ""Yes ma'am, but I sort of have a wife""
She looked and said, ""I know""
I said, ""But what does that mean?""
She said, ""I know means I know how not to be seen""
My mind said no, but my body said yep
So I probably put my number in her phone before she left

What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but

AM and to PM

Because my girl don't need to see them
And every time I see her
It makes me want to leave her
Caught between these two chicks
I don't know which I prefer
I told her, ""You don't know how powerful you is
With just one text you destroy all of this
My kids, my wife, my life, my home
All of this is gone with just a message from your phone
I said, ""Think we should cut this off before it all goes sour
Because no side chick should have all this power""
I rolled out of my bed and hopped into the shower
And I was at her house in less than an hour
I was such a coward, I was so confused
I let it all continue because I didn't want to choose
And that's how you lose everything you ever dreamed of

Saw my homies from my neighborhood comin' up the street
Dressed in all blue from the head to they feet
They didn't see me, but I seen them
I try to dip out that's when I hear the homie Demon he like
""What up Nick, cuz?""
I'm like ""Shit, fuck""
These motherfuckers Goddamn
I just don't understand
Gettin' caught up with these niggas wasn't part of the plan
I act like I'm happy to see 'em
I dap 'em up
And in the back of my mind I know they about to act up
""Haaa, what y'all niggas doin' up here?""
(Nothin' cuz, heard some enemies was up here)
(You wanna leave Nick?)
(You got a problem?)
(Guess you only kick it with us when you got a problem)
I just had them tools at my school last week
I told them fools they're trippin', then they came up there mad deep
A friend in need is a friend indeed
So I tried to distract 'em and I offered 'em some weed
It didn't work, they seen them dudes at the chicken spot
All them blood niggas standin' up on the rooftop
Didn't take long before they spotted us
And any other day they would've been done shotted us
Too many people in the street to bear witness
And they all hopped down from the roof with a quickness
I seen one of 'em try to reach in his waist
So Colossus threw a barbecue grill in his face
Sparks flyin' everywhere, people is screamin'
That's when two of 'em tried to hop on Demon
And I seen a fist comin' out of my periphery
And all of the sudden the asphalt got slippery
I got hit
My feet slipped out from under me
Now I'm goin' down, down, down, like a submarine
Knocked out cold in the middle of Crenshaw
A nigga named Grit got credit for the pinfall
I woke up, slightly concussed in handcuffs
Bleedin' from my head, I could barely even stand up
Police askin' me what transpired
When I said I didn't know they was callin' me a liar
A call on they radio said shots fired
So they had to let me go 'cause a priority was hired
They drove off, tires screechin', lights flashin'
Homies pulled up and told me get my ass in
I got to the crib and I got me a ice pack
These niggas wanna smoke right before they go strike back
Now they got jokes, laughin' cause I got knocked out
I'm happy that I'm home, I give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout

Then went into the house to grab some drinks, it was half-time
Shaking my head, we went straight to the bed
Then started making so much noise, it's like we waking the dead
She said ""I never stopped feeling you, thought about killing you
Last time you left, it felt like my heart split in two""
I told her I'd fix her, didn't stop, I just kissed her
Put my head between her legs and showed her how much I missed her

Three in the morning and you ain't come over yet?
It's like the nice guys always get the most disrespect
Your phone die? You didn't see my text?
See, I already know what you 'bout to say next
""Sex was so amazing that I didn't want to leave her fam""
It takes more than sex if you really wanna keep a man
Quicksand, when I struggle it gets deeper
And before I ever leave her, I would rather meet the reaper (damn)

Of course that's what got her

Let me turn my music down I said, say my nigga
Oh shit, he pullin' out the hammer
I left mine at home, I was in my pajamas
See, I woke up late
Realized I hadn't ate
Went to my favorite spot and thought that I would be straight
I hop back in my whip, tried to run the nigga over
Hopin' that he didn't see the plates on the rover
Made a right on cloverdale, then a left
Parked in the driveway, then ran up the steps
I grabbed my piece, hopped back in the streets
I know this young motherfucker don't really want beef
Look, I'm 30-something, still down to murder something
But when I stopped to think about it, it was all over nothing
So fuck it
I'm about to head to the crib
Then aww, shit
Look who it is!
I know this motherfucker ain't really gettin' tacos
I parked in the red, grabbed my shit and I walked slow
Right up behind him, I put my gun in his back
I said, ""yeah my nigga, what was up with all of that?""
""Fuck what you wanna do, this what you gonna do""
""Hands in your pocket, keep your eyeballs in front of you""
Then this lady came and kissed him on the cheek
He said ""hi, mom"", and then they both start to speak
I said, ""ah, shit, this young punk""
""He gangbangin' when he 'bout to meet his mama for lunch?""
The line for the tacos was long anyways, so I walked off laughin'

Nobody guessed that I would do these things
Manifested my destiny, acting out my lucid dreams

Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, 
they throwing this tongue about like having some candy clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)
If they try to put a case on this, we gon' beat it (we gon' beat it)
Interrupted a groovy movie, so we said fuck it left it and ate at Ruby Tuesday's
Snotty white waitress said sorry, I'm so blunt
One of the homies singing YG's ""Fuck Donald Trump""
And she said ""Fuck Obama""
And we said ""Fuck yo mama""
And your granny too, 'cause we would never touch your nana, bitch
Manager say we gotta leave
Not before I get a shot, I get it then I appease
And he said ""No""
So I got somebody shot off the bar quick, lifted it up and said 
""Here's to you sucking my dick""

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn
I don't give a fuck if they say we wrong
You better keep your hands up when they play this song
And keep your hands in the air
If you know the government don't care
If you got on $5 underwear
But you're feeling like a fucking millionaire
And can I get a hell yea?
Do It Big, Keep It Strange, don't care
Keep your eyes on the prize, don't share

Murs,"Uh hi, everyone
My name is Murs, and uh
Yeah, I've had a rough couple years
But uh, you know
I guess I was depressed
I don't feel depressed anymore
Uh, you know I'm just at this point where I'm not too high
And I'm not too low, I'm just here
And that's okay
And there's a word for that
It's called melancholy
Yeah

They say that happiness is a choice
Well, I guess they get to choose
Put all them so-called friends with they fake ass friends
Ain't never been in my shoes
Had my back up against the wall
'Bout to jump up off the edge
Just paid for a shrink but she made me think
That the problem's all in my head
So with that said, I went solo
On my own tryna face my fears
I stopped, popped a pill, and it all got real
So I started writing this right here
And it took me years to get to this point
Where I don't wanna die every day
You can't put it in your mind to be down all the time
'Cause the sun go shine anyway

I been walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Blindfold, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
And it takes a toll on my soul
Said it takes a toll on my soul
Walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy

Now I heard they call me crazy, I just act like I can't hear
But they ain't had it this rough or even lost as much
As I did in just one year
Have you ever had the feeling like you don't wanna die
But like, wait, still not wanna be here
That fog roll in and them days get dark
And it start getting hard for you to see clear
I know that pain too well, I swear I been through hell
If I don't smile, oh well, just worry 'bout yourself
I tell 'em leave me 'lone, I'm just in my zone
But some people can't take the hint
When my life so strange, I been through so much change
Why would I need yo' two cents?
But everybody got they ideas
On how to make my pain go away
But opinions is just like a SoundCloud page
Everybody got one these days
So you can kill the interrogation
'Cause you only wasting your time
If you mind your business then I mind mine
And everything gon' be just fine

Before the hipsters moved in on that fake shit
I'm from Midtown without the gang politics
Jefferson to Pico, I represent for all of it
Mexicans and niggas know, I been letting niggas know
Screaming Cloverdale before I let the trigger go
But I let the trigger go, fuck being a criminal
Still rolling with some shiesty, hustlin' individuals
Bend the law till it almost break
Man y'all always 10 deep, nigga y'all so fake
That's why I don't bring the homies to alot of my shows
Can't be responsible when they start to throwin' blows
Can't stop real niggas from doing what they gotta do
My homies like to trip, talk shit, and wear alot of blue
Nowadays everybody on some different shit
Got the head up out the hood, the future's unlimited

Piercing police tried to kill me, I am not dead
Before the grace of God, there go I
That means I could've been any of the homies that died
Guided by the most high, I am so far from worthless
I survive, I am present with a purpose
If only to make you nervous
And challenge status quo, I have done my service
Ay man, ay man, ay man, ay man
When I tell you where I'm from, what you gotta say then
I suggest that you respect my pride

Hey look, man I know, that this beat is gangster as fuck
But I'm not, and I never have been
I'm all about peace and love and unity
And this song is about my dream and how
My whole career I just wanted everyone to get along
Man I know everybody from midtown from somewhere different
We don't all get along
But if we don't get it together you all
They about take this whole shit right out from under us
So yall don't gotta fuck with them niggas over there
But don't fuck with them niggas over there
You know what I'm saying?
It's about being at peace with yourself
And once you're at peace with yourself

They call me slept on, guess I'm the one they dreaming 'bout
But when they finally woke, it'll be my name that they'll be screaming out
Been walking this path since an early age
Reading books by the Panthers, building up my rage
At age 14, rest soul on ice
Spook Who Sat By The Door, read that joint twice
Ice Cube, Brotha J and Ice T
These are the professors that would set my mind free
Fuck the police to the Easton cop killer
These were my textbooks, sorry it was not thriller
That pop music was filler, no disrespect to Mike
But I was fed up and focused, I was ready to fight
The power
With Flavor Flav and Carl Ryder now emerged my energy with Public Enemy for many hours
Towers of Babylon that radiate pollution
Are the same ones we'll be using to stream the revolution

Facts is facts and the fact is whack is whack
Nowadays they need to let the rappers rap
Facts is facts and the fact is trap is trap

Get your money, but just let the rappers rap
Rappers act like rappers but they still singing
Autotune and making music with no meaning

I stand for the flag, and stand for my people
This is not a contradiction, I am not a fan of evil
Most of these rappers is evil as these politicians
Flexing on their own folks who ain't even got a pot to piss in
Still they loving on the bad guy
Try to be the hero, my people tell me to stand by (Stand by)
Cause I don't rap about the coonery
I'm Rogue One, standing like Diego in this lunacy
Ergo, my Earth go Urso, full circle
And we plant seeds amongst the weeds to make the Earth grow
Pollocks sprout as I spout this intelligence
Horrid in my aura, my intent is of intelligence
Radio once meant relevance, now irrelevant
It's all about the playlist, the playing field is levelling
If you got better ideas, then I am Edison
Electrifying and defining true music medicine

We live in this odd paradox right?
This juxtaposition of knowing too much and not enough
I got facts to quote ya, you just don't know when to shut up
When you can't un-understand
Know too much to leave it alone and not enough to trust the process of seeing too much
Art that builds cultures and chants down tyranny's power
And empowers powerless, homie how you gon' change the land with one tenth of your man's fanbase

They still use my login for the HBO
Amazon, Netflix, and some mo' shit

And get your sister 'cause she slidin' in my DMs
Sayin' we should meet up at the gym and we should be friends

We must protect our way, can't nobody say nothin' bad about bae
They can talk crazy but it's just talk
But if I let them phase me it's my fault
I'm secure 'til you show me why I shouldn't be
I ain't never had a woman be this good to me, ohh

When you used to claim each other, now they in pain
Now they slander your name and your label mates reppin' Strange
All because you found a new lane, they really hate that you took away that wing
Now we can not keep it cordial
When you treat them with respect, they treat you horrible

Now when I see you, I wouldn't give the bitch a morsel
Threaten my life in my phone talkin' to gang streets
Havin' my homies lookin' forward to havin' a bang day
All this hatin' when I was young 'til I became great
Tellin' you people that don't feel me, I feel the same way, fuck y'all

Murs,"What if I could ice down all of my tears
Would my face be covered in diamonds from ear to ear?
Would real niggas respect me then?
Will some of these white girls wanna be more than my friend?
If I could take all of my tears and cry them into a chain
I wonder how many million more followers I'd gain
I bet my socials would be super lit
It wouldn't even matter what type of vocals that I have to spit
I could turn all this salty water that fell from my eyes into some diamond karats
Then when I cry in public I could finally do so 
Without having someone tell me I should feel embarrassed
'Cause I'm not and I cried a whole lot
When I filed a divorce and when the homie got shot
And not one time did I laugh at Tyrese's tears
'Cause when I was separated from my son I cried every day for almost a year
And at near the end of that year span I was filled with joy
'Cause my new fiance and I were expecting a baby boy
But after forty weeks he was born without a heartbeat
Still we chose to march forward instead of retreat

I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next
'Cause life is just a battle in the shadow of death

We bury Pooh in the very same day
They called us said they wanna take my baby away
I beat the case but I didn't beat the odds
I got so many questions when I finally meet God
""Like why you make it so hard? Why you even let me try?
Why my marriage couldn't work? Why you let my baby die?""
I apologize for not, you about to hear alot
This is not really music, it's me dealing with my thoughts
It was breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe
It's hard to kill the drama when the trauma won't leave
So if karma does exist I find it hard to believe
'Cause if you reap what you sow, I didn't sow these seeds
I need a Grammy for the damage, platinum plaque as a bandage
A couple healthy kids before I start to understand it
But because the fans demand it and the label said I should
I put it all into these songs and the hopes its understood

I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next

Murubutu,"Io che sognavo di volare sopra i suoi respiri
Ma che i profili dei camini non li vidi mai
Perché tanti dei miei voli erano solo voli falliti
Come i primi tentativi dei fratelli Wright
C'è chi dice viva nei miti e trasporti i sogni alle folle
Che abbia insegnato a stare attenti alle forme, a stare a tempo alle foglie
Che abbia una scienza enorme nel coglierle
Che abbia insegnato le movenze alle fronde delle paulonie
Attenti ad affondi e a manovre alla rotta delle flotte delle parole
Arrivano dal fondo senza dire mai dove
Si dice che parli attraverso i via vai nei laghi delle onde di polvere
O il battito delle porte imposte esposte ad ovest
Io credo a chi sa leggere i pollini sollevati nei vortici
Sì, senza sbagliare scia
Per me non è un evento, è un concetto
O almeno è un elemento in concerto
Che manda le navi del senso sugli scogli della sua armonia
Un giorno lo vidi, sulla linea costiera cosparsa di viti
Una piccola casa in sassi e lamiera, tra lavanda e ulivi
Là in mezzo sommerso dove il sole divora i crinali
Non sentivo più freddo, avevo solo gli occhi più chiari e puliti

Muove le barche poi entra in un bar che oggi non apre
Il proprietario ricorda il proprio padre
Quante volte ha letto ""chiuso per lutto""
Ma non immaginava il giorno in cui l'avrebbe scritto
Sospetto esista una vita oltre la morte, ho degli indizi
Ma mancano le prove, gli indirizzi
Perché si mangia tutto, cannibalismo
Vandalismo come Wanna Marchi, Wannalismo
Si porta via le foglie, l'arco e il resto dello staff
Facendo saltare i ponti e gli innocenti, come la mafia
Voliamo tutti, volenti o nolenti
E ci pisciamo sopra i piedi involontariamente
Pollini virali veicolati in spirali
E Cristo si ferma ad Eboli, perché teme l'ebola
E lei teme di andarsene e mi stampa il sale sulla lingua
E fa per piangere, ma temo sia il vento, o che finga
La spiaggia va a finire nella mia granita di sangria
E mi insabbia il corpo, come la polizia
Ma io mi sento al centro del mondo come se le stelle
Fossero occhi di altri sulla mia pelle

Qui dove ogni opposto convive
Fischia tra i pilastri e le tue melodie
Sto in piedi sull'orlo del cratere
I capelli sembrano bandiere
Sciolte al sole o appese fiere su di un'asta
Qua stanno dritte come la coda di un Amstaff
Il tempo passa
Mellifluo come in una vasca di melassa
La mia musa è grassa, nera e vestita con un kaftan
L'animale sale da lei sulle zampe
Salivando perché il fare è ipnotizzante
Questa pozza appare come un mare grande
Quando spira l'aria arriva da Levante
E quante stelle si ammazzano per un grazie?
Tante, si ammassano insieme come in un cluster
Al che cavalco Pegaso tra le galassie
Adesso che le mascelle hanno levato tutte le ganasce
Che allo stupore non c'è fine
Un campo di cardi e noi stesi sulle traversine
Sulle traversie delle mie trenta e più candeline
Tu soffi ed il fuoco sembra raggiungere le cime
Non lo spegnere",Levante,2016

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Musab,"Â??Dungeons and Dragonsâ?? by Dr. Demento

Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons

Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.

Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!

Graham: They're right next to you.

Galstaff: I cast a spell.

Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!

Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!

Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.

Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!

Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.

Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?

Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.

Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?

Graham: What room?

Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.

Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!

Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.

Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.

Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.

Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.

(laughing)

Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.

Picard: Whoa! That's me right?

Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.

Graham: Let me see that sheet.

Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.

Galstaff: Hello.

Picard: Hello.

Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

(laughing)

Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.

Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!

Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.

Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!

Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.

Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!

Graham: No you didn't.

Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?

Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.

Graham: But you never actually cast it.

Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.

Nightblade: Are there any girls there?

Graham: Yeah!

Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...

Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.

Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!

Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!

Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!

Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up.

And one of us gotta crawl under the bus
If we wanna stand a chance of standing up without a crutch
And I ain't trying to sound dismissive of that target you've been squinting at
We've all been ranging far beyond our range of limitations
Even when I try to take the bullet, I'm impatient
Looking at your face for validation
Fly like dishes but sleep like strangers
Protect my interests, what you think these fangs for?
This isn't even anger
It's just disappointment pointed in a million directions
This it's tight and stressed like a tight rope stretched
Across my whole chest this is why I'm flexing
Please forgive my voice but I'm lost in the void
When I look to the future, neither one of us enjoying it
We ought to stop and start smelling these flowers
Before the world reminds us that it's not really ours

Life is hard
Some stains are too deep to wipe them off
So we must strive for a higher cause
There's something that is clearly missed
Both of us are running from experiences
Frustrated today, nitpicking tomorrow
Sittin' in our sorrow, sippin' from a bottle
Where do we go wrong, why do we prolong?
I wanna grab my hat and throw my coat on
We sleep in different beds, we're taking different meds
This relationship is so Night Of The Living Dead
I know it's morbid, but there's the mortgage, there's the storage
There's the four kids, I will not forfeit
Whatever, we can make it under pressure
We're both bad with money, we spent the college fund together
And I've got nothing else to say about it
Let's just pray about it, I mean it

Hit the sixth row, pass the courtside section
I know you clown niggaz must be kidding

This Lefrak commission, put a ending to your vision
This rap shit turn five to sixth sense's

Yo, yo, yo, I'ma have to stand up
Take game, I got grabbed up
Asking me questions, interogating
The way the hatin, they just remind me of satan
Keep em motivating, police asking questions about this and this
I don't know shit, and hell no, I don't know 5 or 6
I'm confined to a small room
I celly off to my beeper, thought I had to sues
And the headache, was the feelings for me and my crew
To take impostas, impalas and black sues
Big boys, and LL cues
I'm thinking like deep cover
I'm in too deep, like Donny Brasco
Who could be the asshole
I make sure the motherfucker don't last long
Roll to the castle where my niggas be, triggas be
Blowin they backs out, they felt the misery
And the decision be, spill coffee
Who's on the beats I can't be locked up
They had evidence, make the scenery all dense
But it's Ok my lawyer will approach the bench

Chorus:
I don't know nobody, and I ain't seen shit
that's the way it is, you try to lock me up
Put me in cuffs, motherfucker hand in your benz

Cause I don't know nobody, and I ain't seen shit
that's the way it is, you try to lock me up
Put me in cuffs, motherfucker hand in your benz

[Capone]
Pop, they caught me off guard
I was stuck the beat shit fucked
I went down to my knees
And put out the trees
I sat down on the benches
He snuck his dog on my five senses
All I could hear was a walky talky saying ""I got em""
I'm asking the charge, yeah you know he shot em
We biscuit printed plus your first henes borrowin
I ain't heard nuff yet, next day daily news read
Murder suspect, 19, down in Queens
Day of rainment where he had slim chance to win it
Two asses from bail so they gave glances
It's Friday, had to lay for the weekend stretch
First thing, Monday morning, calling for street connects
Man I forgot the machine they callin for
Fuck a message all they need is it playin back
I'm confined a 8 by 12 flat
With bums niggas who sell crack
Flippin off the the world

Chorus
[Maze]
It's like 4 in the morning and the crib sleeping easily
My dogs got me off feet face me slow down
I'm like what the fuck the deal
He's like the shut the fuck up
We got evidence, we know the deal
They got tape confessions of your man
Whiping out your man
Key witness to the stands
I should have played yours
The moving bar to my moms get the news to bar
Same time Jake taking me out
Same line gonna try and fake me out
Sitting in the van pointing face out
Soon as I hit the plan, the course going close the plan
Take em out, take em out, before the court day out
I won't say, but by tomorrow, I'm out
Nothing to say follow snitch
Lay low, and hollow him out
And pones is wilding too
Niggas like Maze got the same time as you

Walking down a half dee, snatch me up
Little g's no pad
These niggas gonna cuff me up
On stayed in the back so he could scuff me up
Blows from the walky talky, gonna fuck me up
Asking me about shit I knew, but won't tell
Just you and Baby D, ain't nobody depending on me
Saying if I won't talk, I'll wait in the cell
They got evidence to leave me in jail
There's no time for this shit
Just sign the statement
If you snitching, you won't have to say shit
Reverse pyschology, he trying to lie to me
He try to pin me for murder
And a string of robberies

Put me through school, swore soon I'd be in a position to rule

Look at me now, your only child breathing through you
For you, by you, the science of FUBU, ill creation
I'm still laying for that day I wake up
Out of this dream, see you kinetically move, a seventies jewel

A star's born, in the form of man, deep like Elijah

Now momma love said if I ever get rich

Mom's was so strong you one of my heart's pride
And you told me I would shine in time, never win, but you know
Through you I spit and make the whole globe glow

I zone on all the things you ever did for me, my grief as a kid
Easing my pain, lifting my name, predicting I'll see fame
Change that bond that's never broken
You my heart for life, put ice on the surface of your soul glowing

To my moms straight royal, look at your boy now
Taught me the young, in turn I spoil you now
Don't even worry I'm a hold you down not far from now
When you see me and the way you've been
Just since my born day, and you proud

No matter what, so I'm touched when I spit it this way

My mother exact opposite, by all means
And it would hurt, when she see me walking in state greens

She called me the night he died, said he ain't make it

Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin now

Caught up wit 'em, had them dudes straight hoppin the fence, it go

Mushroomhead,"I'm thirsty - And weary from the heat
As the Sands rinse the hands of time
I will suck the venom from your wound
If you will do the same and suck from mine,

You and I - Were ruined by
This desert between us
I walked through the valley
And stared into death

This instance of a distance
Designed to defeat us
And still her face I can't seem to forget

The war you wage
Forever the life that you pay
Something wrong in you
Comes alive in your veins

Lose yourself in some kind of Hell
A new version of where you are now 
Truth's unveiled
You'll never ever get out

At a glance - Sudden avalanche
Suffocated me within
Gasping for air I can't breathe

Paralyzed - I've been sterilized
And cleansed of my sin
In a state of suspended belief

Somewhere along the way
Time changes everything 
We all disintegrate
It's running out,

Taunted by time
Imposing it's certainty
Absolute always
Stopping for nothing
This race cannot be won

So days it crawls
While other days it flies
It feeds on our flaws
And knows no compromise
Inevitable rise of the sun
Time what have I become

Somewhere along the way
Time changes everything 
We all disintegrate
It's running out,

The war you wage 
Somewhere along the way
It's running out.",Along the Way,2002

I think I sealed my fate along the way I may have lost my mind

Nothing left to die for
(I can't recall my crime I think I sealed my fate)
Thoughts inside can make me crawl
(Think I sealed my fate)
Make me drop down on my knees
Break me down until I question me

Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Welcome my downfall
Sun doesn't rise at all

Somewhere in this dying day as I plan my great escape
I find it hard to concentrate while you maintain control
I fold and falter, empty alter, all I gave I pray it makes me whole
I think the brink's around the corner
There's an error in my soul

I can't feel my faith can't recall my crime

Fall on deaf ears all of my prayers

The mother of nothing
The mother of sin

The father of decadence within us
A brother of suffering inside

I hope you like what you've done to me

Drown in your misery

We need something new you made up
When you give up its never enough

Only through your suffering

Will you learn to forget

Can you erase the doubt

And give me more than I need

You never knew that it was so short

Your digging deep inside yourself

you're digging deep to find some pity

Fake all your promises
Forget what your conscience says
Just another number in a long line
Of no one
Just pretending that were ending
Hating what we are

So frustrating suffocating
How did we get this far

Your life beings way too fast
You can never change your past

Living life in your yesterday

Are we really that far that we can't even see

Al the truth from the lies
In this man made disease

That is killing us and is filling us
Willing us to believe

I never know what's going down

Looking deep inside myself
I've never known anything else

With no restraint
Creating a place that you
Cannot defend
Suffocating need befalls you
When there's nothing left
To hang on to
We fall through
Till there's nothing left for us
Far too hard to trust
And you fall down dying to know you
Creating a place you can never defend
Sensing the pain
That's inside of your mind
Breaking down beyond your sight

Of me so seldom seen
Can I survive myself inside you

Ev'ry Teddy Bear who's been good
Is sure of a treat today.
There's lots of marvelous things to eat
And wonderful games to play.

Beneath the trees where nobody sees
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
'Cause that's the way the
Teddy Bears have their picnic.

Picnic time for Teddy Bears
The little Teddy Bears are having
A lovely time today.
Watch them, catch them unawares,
And see them frolic on their holiday

See them gaily gad about
They love to play and shout,
They never have any care;
At six o'clock their Mommies and Daddies
Will take them home to bed,
Because they're tired little Teddy Bears.

If you go down to the woods today,
You'd better not go alone!
It's lovely down in the woods today,
But safer to stay at home!

For ev'ry bear that ever there was
Will gather there for certain, because
Today's the day the
Teddy Bears have their picnic.

Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too

Hey, yo', cutey what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my heart to you
You should be givin' me your heart too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Uh, don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no, uh, don't be cruel
Uh, girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too

I like be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me, girl, is like a heart attack
I'm real troop trooper and with all the times
That you were by my side diggin' dollars outta crock

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool, it just ain't cool
Uh, don't be cruel

We used to hang out tough just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find

Although I want you bad, I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
But due to fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see

But you had to start givin', tryin' to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willin'
To be with me Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete

Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

A produce of my age
There's no choosing my direction
I was a holy man but now
With all my trials behind me
I am weak in my conviction

And so I walk to try to get away
Knowing that someday 
I will finally have to face
The fear that will come from knowing that
The one thing I had left was you
And now you're gone

You were a victim of my crimes
A product of my rage
You were a beautiful distraction
I kept you locked away outside
Let misery provide
And now I am ashamed

You're still glowing like a ray of light
Gotta a little thicker in your hips and thigh
I must say you look fine, so fine
Maybe someday we'll share sometime
That's if you don't mind

Sometimes I wonder why people, act like the way they do
All the drama and changes they, like to take you through
Now it's cool to think that you're cool with somebody but the bottom line reality
No matter how bad that you think you do, dawg you don't know me
When you see me in public don't you worry about it yo it's cool
I shake your hand give mad love I ain't got no beef with you
Just understand that sometimes I need my space to breathe
You probably feel the same as me, if these shoes were on your feet
I can't control how you feel about it
But all the drama I sure can do without it, yeah
So go on, and feel the way that you want bout how you think I am
But remember at the end of the day
I'm just a person like you trying to do the best that I can
And that's real

I wanna thank you for letting me be myself
I wanna thank you",Intermission: Juslisen,2002

Mother-Father before I forget
Thank you for all that you have been to me
And just in case you are wondering I love you

I know that our difference caused
Us to waste so much of our time we could have used
Getting to know each and one another
But now that I've grown into my own
And learned some things about life
I now can see that it wasn't easy to raise someone like me

[Chorus]

I remember those days when you used to sit me down
And try to school me about the plenty opportunities in life
Hoping and wishing and praying that something would stick
And somehow click within this mind of mine
See you used to say, if you throw enough on the wall
Something is bound to rub off
And I'm here to tell you 
That you don't have to really worry about me at all

[Chorus]

Listen now
There was no limit to all the things that you've done
And would have for me my sisters and brothers
And I'll never understand how you would talk all day long
And just as you said, in one ear and out the other
Isn't it funny how things change when you get older?
Now I know that I'll never find another

Tell me what you wanna do? So I can give you all you want
If you just say it, so, say it baby.

If you need me to be patient

Keep leading me on and you keep pushing me away
When all along I know, yes I do
That you really want me to stay baby.

You you need me but you seem to be just a little afraid
That cools its OK, it's alright cause I want you baby

I'm willing to wait just as long as you know that I want you girl
Cause I want you, but I want you to want me too.

I want you to want me 
Just as bad as I want you cause I can understand baby if you're 
Not ready and if you need me to be patient wit you 
I'll take my time wit you baby, 
I'll take my time as much time as you need so we can get this
Thing right girl and make it last forever.

Fine as the autumn sun with a heart of gold, yeah
One day we talked about some men in her past
Cause I was just trying to understand

Why it's always like she always tried to hide
What it is she feels or what's on her mind
When it comes to love 
She gets so afraid that someone will come 
And hurt her again someday

[Chorus]
All of her life she never had
Someone show her what it means
To have or be in real love

She never had a man who was kind to her
Never told her I love you without getting hurt, no
Some people say she's bitter some think she's scared
Some people say she thinks nobody cares

Now she walks around and protects her heart
Never looks for love
Lives behind a wall
Tell it to herself all men are all the same
Cause that's how it is
And that is such a shame

Not formally introduced
But I've been watching her watching me all night
And then she disappeared for a few
Must have got herself a drink or two
To work up a nerve to come and say hi
She politely spoke her name
Like a gentleman I did the same
And she sat down and we talked for a moment, yeah
She told me she'd be pleased to be 
The lucky lady leaving with me
That sounds nice but I'd hate to hurt my woman

That's what she said to me, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, goodbye, goodbye
But for now you gotta live for the moment

Now what I look like deceiving my lady
The future mother of my babies
And lose a love that took years to build
To do that I must be crazy
And right now I don't feel crazy
Even though you're killing me with your sex appeal
And on the real she may never know
But the problem is I'll know
But how can I look into my baby's eyes
Now it just might be cool for some
But I refuse to be the one
To let a moment ruin my life

Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown

What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll

Prepare for flight, this is your captain

And leave a good impression on someone else

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

In all of the rumors and lies
We’re the same as you, we got feelings too
And you know we’re human, just trying to live our lives

There will come a day when the world is gonna change
And then, things will be much better than how they are
Where happiness is the way and joy out weighs the pain
And oh, how I prayed to God that day isn’t far
'Cause in this world

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

All we want in this world, we can have through love
All we need in this world, we can get with love
All we got in this world, we can keep through love
All we got to do is just, give a little more love in this world

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around

And hollered like what's up girl
You said nothing man, and you smiled and went on your way
Like you didn't even notice me
And really like you didn't even want to speak
But that's cool, cause now its almost like everyday
I'm going off the things you do things you say
It seems like our lives have been syndicated
But my minds bout the music, we can both make it
Who would have thought we'd go from a straight up ignore
To talkin' bout who wants more
Just let me tell

Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

Check it out how it transpired
We went from a spark to a raging fire
Down like a car with 4 flat tires
She my superstar, I'd be the shine behind her (ya mean)
She got a nigga wide open
Shook like a tree when the wind is blowin'
She my Missy, im her Timbaland
She rock my planet like
Zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh
My mans and them said get it in
But my plans have been to get it in
Cause I do that, never been a rude cat
I play fair so we go tic for tack till the blackness bares
First reaction was weird but it still was nice
So good that we did it twice
I'm saying in the beginning
She as scared but it still was nice
So good we did it twice
I'm telling you

Baby baby baby (I want you)
Baby baby baby
Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

All all girl all I all that I need I need is you
All that I want and need is you",Infatueighties,2003

Well I been haunted in my sleep
You've been staring in my dreams
Girl I miss you
Been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
Its just some friends of mine, that say
""What's the matter man
We goin' come around at 12 
With some pretty girls that's just dying to meet you.
We goin' bring a case of wine, 
And lets go and fool around
Like we used to""

Musiq,"Have you ever had a day when
Nothing goes your way
All you do seems to be in vain
And everything is just a waste of your time

But have you ever had that moment in life
When everything is cool (yeah)?
Didn't have to worry about the time
It all went as it should
And you were having the greatest moment in life (yeah)

Don't you worry about the past 'cause
It's gonna be what it is?
All that you can do is try to
Make your future beautiful
Just let it be the greatest moment in life

I remember almost every December when we were critters
And mama said that there was only one thing she could get us
When God must have been with us
'Cause it is heavenly joy
When you wake up Christmas morning to every toy
Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

It's like all a sudden your life is so cool
'Cause everything in it is working for you
Your friends and your family are getting along

Or when you know that you got money to spend

Someone to love you back, someone to love 
You and when you gave your heart, 
And when you gave your heart
You didn't give your all

Of a beautiful day
And like a song
An angel passed my way
She was the embodiment of perfection
With skin like the sky
And her hair was as long as time
Then she turned to me (yeah)
With her big proud eyes
Her voice flowed like water
And it brought a tear to my eye

And I want to thank you see cause

Is because of you and I am proud to say
That you helped make me into what I am today
I applaud you for being so patient with me

Is because of you and I am proud to say
No one else could do what you have done for me
You mean the world to me (yeah)

There were times when I was so
Frustrated with you
I felt I didn't want you no more
But then I realized
That without you I would be so alone (yeah)
But I chose to deal with you,
Whether right or wrong and I'm so glad I did cause

You turned an empty heart to work of art
And open my eyes to the world
I would have never known, for that I'm grateful

You think I would have listened, when you said to me
To get my life together or you would leave
But now that you're gone the story begins
It's the ending of the end of an endless and

Looking back I was bringing you down
But now I'm changing my life
You said when I make a change I could stop on by
Now I'm back and I cant live without you

If you cant have the one you love
Then where are you going
In your life
If you can have the person in your life
Then where are you headed in your life

I know you still remember all of the times
I had you waiting by the telephone
And never came on the line
But now I got myself together
And finally understand
This time I'll take your heart in the palm of my hand

Looking back I was bringing you down
But now I'm changing my song
You said when I change I could come back home
Now I'm back and I cant live without you

Musiq,"Yo listen
I met this girl on Baltic Ave.
And you can tell how she steps on boardwalk,
She was from Park Place
I asked what she was doing on this side of town
She said she had some taxes to pay
I figure I'd take a chance and advance to go
And find out more about
Cause there more to know than the way she ways
And the way that she wears her clothes,
Or the way she plays this game (so cold)
She said she came up rough 
And one income was not enough
There'd be nights she'd go to sleep hungry
Cause her mom was always short on food and money
See people used to joke a lot
Tease her bout her clothes not being in style
Dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers
From the finest second hand down Oriental Ave.

[Chorus]

But now look at her
She got this game on lock
Anything she ever wanted now she got it
And I've gotta say
And I'm proud to see
That someone like her is in central
Womanopoly

Once she graduated junior high she started working overtime
Scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines
Just so she could help her mother out and
After college they moved into Marvin Gardens
And she got a job working at the city water department
To raise enough cash
In move into community chest condos on Pennsylvania Ave
She fell in love with this dude named ray
Who was a small time hustler from St. Charles place

And he was known for always bein' in and out of trouble
But the problem was that he was never on her level
She argued with her mom about ray's work
Til he was sent upstate on the same day that she gave birth
But see the baby never made it, it drove her nearly crazy
And she couldn't take it

[Chorus]

(Listen) see where she came from
Many people find it hard just to hang on
You often find them in the same place complaining
Instead of finding a better way of maintain
She could have balled up and cry
Wished that she would die
And just gave up on tryin'
Instead she grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom now she's on top and she's flying

[Chorus]",Womanopoly,2003
Musiq,"Girl lately I been thinking bout
The times that I shared with you
And there's something that I figured out,
Darling you must have been heaven sent
There isn't nothing better than
Things that you say and do
No, so why do I feel I'm being played for a fool
Cause whenever you call on me I come through for you but
When I need you, you can't seem to do the same for me
And I love that you pay your phone no mind
When we're alone but sometimes
When I try to reach you
I wonder if your just busy, or you don't know that it's me

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now everyday when you're around
You always cater to my needs like
You seemed to be concerned
If I'm eating or sleeping properly (yeah)
Its has to be the greatest thing to know
The one you love loves you back
Or is the love you have for me really true or is it just an act
Cause when you're hard at work and when I'm hard at work
And we can't talk
We just page each other with our sexual wishes
But when we're spending quality time and your pager rings
I wonder
Who could be when you answer laughing at your reply
Or is it that I'm just being suspicious

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic
For these matters of the heart and so
I hope we can grow to raise a family
Nourished in trust and happiness and love

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Cause you love me don't ya

I'd to hate walk away from you as if this never existed

Lately I gotta watch what I say
Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back

What happened to the one I used to know (oh yeah yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with
The one I used to tell all my secrets
We used to chill and be down for
Whatever
Whenever
Together yeah

Crazy baby)

Just don't know)

Should roll up in the sheets and let me spark thatL

Should we just roll some more 
So we can flow some more 
Or maybe I should just take you home 
And make you flend for my 
Like a love jones

It we evident that you were hesitant when we did it 
You rolled it, I lit it, we hit it 
Instantly you effected my state of being to cloud nine 
I can tell that the hydro got you 
by the way your eyes were half closed and mine too 
Lord knows if we would have rolled another stogie 
You would've been holding like En Vogue 
I knew that you laced it 
Yes indeed 
Cause I can tell when I tasted it 
Yes indeed 
Got me breaking in sweats 
Feeling like something crawling all over my neck 
You got me drawn yes indeed 
I can't believe that you got this type of effect on me

Musiq (Soulchild),"Before you go can we just talk a moment
We shouldn't end it like this
Can we just chill for awhile
Put your bags down, just try to hear me out
I know that recently we've been fussing and fighting
And I know that you're tired of me
But if you leave this is how I'll be
Picture me

Picture me
Down and out, lost without you
Picture me
Broken hearted
And so lost and lonely

You don't want to go
As much as I want you stay
Cause I built my whole life around you
And I'm not just about to let it all slip away
And what about the tears that we've shared
And all the things that we said
We're they all just in vain
Girl if you bounce on me
What I used to be is just a memory
This is how I'll be 

[Chorus]

I know that I fucked up alright
And I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
I mean but I got issues
You got issues, every body got issues
We're human ya mean
So what you want me to do about that
I mean cause

I can tell a bunch of lies
And make like everything is alright
But I know deep down inside that I'll be 
Deceiving you and misleading you
And I don't want to so can we just try
Try this one last time
Let's give it one more chance
Before you say good-bye

Can you picture me girl
Not wanting to eat no more
Not wanting to sleep no more
Only want to be with you
Cause I need ya
I got to have you",Poparatzo,2000
Musiq (Soulchild),"I never thought on the first night 
You would bare what you hold so dear to life
And share with me all your innermost fantasies baby
And afterwards in my arms you cried
Had me feeling some kind of way on the inside
Then I knew it was going to be me and you

So if the world was to believe that what we share weren't meant to be
Then it would be just you and me against the world
And if our friends and family if our friends and family
Can't bear to see us both happy 
Then it will be just you and me against the world, yeah

Now I'm not the kind that kiss and tell
But my man said that he really knows you well
But I don't care cause I want to know you for my damn self 
And even if my sister said you scandalous
Said that you're known to go from one man to the next
But I don't care what she say
'Cause you're going to forever be my lady

So if the world was to believe that what we share weren't meant to be
Then it would be just you and me against the world
And if our friends and family if our friends and family
Can't bear to see us both happy 
Then it will be just you and me against the world

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
You see it wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you
And you don't ever have to worry about me
As long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind 
You speak on how you feel
Stay truthful to me 
Never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets 
No matter whatever, whatever no
Girl you know what I mean

They could say what they want
But it will never change my views 
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I know you
See I'm trying to share the rest of my whole life with you
And if we got to be alone, so be it baby
If they can't understand our love
Then we don't need them baby
We can go against the whole world
Even our friends turn on us
Even our family turns on us
That's alright 
'Cause as long as we got each other baby
Then we can make it baby

Musiq (Soulchild),"So, many people
Are on a search to find
Within their days for that place
Within their minds to hide

And dump the load of this worldly life
And the things
That it can make you feel and do
Just to pass away your time

But you be alright
'Cause if you just hold on
Be strong you
You'll be alright
Yes you will

People have a tendency
To think to themselves
That they're the only ones
Going through more things than anyone else

But oh, I bet you'll beg to differ
If you would just consider much bigger picture
'Cause then you would see that most people go through
The same things that you do in life

But you be alright
'Cause if you can take it
You surely can make it
You'll be alright

Just take a good look around
Look at the things and all the people that you see
'Cause we share a joy, we share our pain
So it doesn't matter at all, were all the same

So you'll be alright, alright
Every things gonna be alright
You'll be alright

You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright

You gonna be alright
You'll be alright
You gonna be alright

Why my love doesn't love me like she used to before
Now lately the sun just doesn't shine and my paradise is gone

We argue and fight
Over things that doesn't really matter
Lord knows that I tried
To give all my love
So what should I do?

You got to understand it's all about give and take
You can't be so demanding
Things won't always go your way
If you just give it time
And think about her feelings
Then things will work out fine
Learn to make her your best friend

I hear what you saying but my girl she's always
Complaining and and blaming me for things I'll never do
And I don't know what, what it is that I did that was 
So wrong to make her feel I'll ever be untrue to her

Things won't always go your way

Learn to make her your best friend

See what you need to do is stop catching attitude's 
And just try to take the time to hear her out
Stop being so defensive and try to be more attentive to
Show here you respect what she's talkin' 'bout
Cause you know how us women can be and when we
Feel threatened we react instinctively 
When our emotions have grown to its high we can tend to
Just let it control 
Our lives

Well all right I'll try next time I'll try a little tenderness 
Even make sure that I give her more complements 
Maybe I could practice on being more patient
And compromise for my baby yeah yeah.

She been diggin' on me like a gold miner
And since then she got a whole lot finer and

I'm caught up with her, I'm so caught up with her

She got book intelligence street common sense
Ain't down for the bull,
She can switch her mode from corporate to ghetto
Even when she gone represent
She's that keep it real type, speaks her mind
When she does and who's she gon' like
'Cause see she's very opinionated
You can take it how you want it
Either you love it or you hate it see but

Sometimes I wonder why people, act like the way they do
All the drama and changes they, like to take you through
Now it's cool to think that you're cool with somebody but the bottom line reality
No matter how bad that you think you do, dawg you don't know me
When you see me in public don't you worry about it yo it's cool
I shake your hand give mad love I ain't got no beef with you
Just understand that sometimes I need my space to breathe
You probably feel the same as me, if these shoes were on your feet
I can't control how you feel about it
But all the drama I sure can do without it, yeah
So go on, and feel the way that you want bout how you think I am

And try to school me about the plenty opportunities in life

Something is bound to rub off
And I'm here to tell you

Musiq (Soulchild),"I am a victim of my time
A produce of my age
There's no choosing my direction
I was a holy man but now
With all my trials behind me
I am weak in my conviction

And so I walk to try to get away
Knowing that someday 
I will finally have to face
The fear that will come from knowing that
The one thing I had left was you
And now you're gone

You were a victim of my crimes
A product of my rage
You were a beautiful distraction
I kept you locked away outside
Let misery provide
And now I am ashamed

And so I walk to try to find a space
Where I can be alone to live with my mistakes
And the fear that will come
From knowing that the one thing
I had left was you

How everything in mama's words would ring so true
Independent people with a different take on living
Now how did we become more than just good friends?

Baby we make such a beautiful contradiction
Together we are in no two ways the same.
Baby we make such a beautiful contradiction
And it's the very thing that sparks the flame.

[musiq soulchild]
You and I should be like oil and water
But somehow we mix together and we make a very special blend
Every day we clash on politics, religion,
But we learned the art of how to kiss and make up in the end yeah.
Sometimes I believe that we were born on different planets
Alien invasion of my heart and soul

Feel somebody you gotta fall, you gotta rise

Like you didn't even notice me
And really like you didn't even want to speak
But that's cool, cause now its almost like everyday
I'm going off the things you do things you say
It seems like our lives have been syndicated
But my minds bout the music, we can both make it
Who would have thought we'd go from a straight up ignore
To talkin' bout who wants more
Just let me tell

Baby baby baby (I want you)
Baby baby baby
Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

Check it out how it transpired
We went from a spark to a raging fire
Down like a car with 4 flat tires
She my superstar, I'd be the shine behind her (ya mean)
She got a nigga wide open
Shook like a tree when the wind is blowin'
She my Missy, im her Timbaland
She rock my planet like
Zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh
My mans and them said get it in
But my plans have been to get it in
Cause I do that, never been a rude cat
I play fair so we go tic for tack till the blackness bares
First reaction was weird but it still was nice
So good that we did it twice
I'm saying in the beginning
She as scared but it still was nice
So good we did it twice
I'm telling you

Baby baby baby (I want you)
Baby baby baby
Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

All all girl all I all that I need I need is you
All that I want and need is you",Infatueighties,2003
Musiq (Soulchild),"Last night I had a dream
Of a beautiful day
And like a song
An angel passed my way
She was the embodiment of perfection
With skin like the sky
And her hair was as long as time
Then she turned to me (yeah)
With her big proud eyes
Her voice flowed like water
And it brought a tear to my eye
And she said to me

Oh you've come
So far from where you started
Don't be afraid
To let your light
Shine on the world",Soulstar,2003
Musiq (Soulchild),"Girl lately I been thinking bout
The times that I shared with you
And there's something that I figured out,
Darling you must have been heaven sent
There isn't nothing better than
Things that you say and do
No, so why do I feel I'm being played for a fool
Cause whenever you call on me I come through for you but
When I need you, you can't seem to do the same for me
And I love that you pay your phone no mind
When we're alone but sometimes
When I try to reach you
I wonder if your just busy, or you don't know that it's me

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now everyday when you're around
You always cater to my needs like
You seemed to be concerned
If I'm eating or sleeping properly (yeah)
Its has to be the greatest thing to know
The one you love loves you back
Or is the love you have for me really true or is it just an act
Cause when you're hard at work and when I'm hard at work
And we can't talk
We just page each other with our sexual wishes
But when we're spending quality time and your pager rings
I wonder
Who could be when you answer laughing at your reply
Or is it that I'm just being suspicious

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic
For these matters of the heart and so
I hope we can grow to raise a family
Nourished in trust and happiness and love

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)

I don't mean to scare you but I
See I'm not really ready for a child
In my life right now
And lets keep it real girl
You don't really know and I 
I've only known you for a little while
So I guess we got a lot of things to figure out

I'm having mixed feelings bout it cause
The idea of it sounds kinda nice but
We both gotta be clear about what it was
Cause we cant say that it happened out of love
Now I know you really want to keep it baby
So I support you and I'm always gonna be there babe
For our baby to make sure that he or
She doesn't grow up and make the same mistake

So be prepared cause we doing this regardless
Of what my mother say or what your father say
We just gotta make sure we on the same page

And mama said that there was only one thing she could get us
When God must have been with us
'Cause it is heavenly joy
When you wake up Christmas morning to every toy
Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

It's like all a sudden your life is so cool

I met this girl on Baltic Ave.
And you can tell how she steps on boardwalk,
She was from Park Place
I asked what she was doing on this side of town
She said she had some taxes to pay
I figure I'd take a chance and advance to go
And find out more about
Cause there more to know than the way she ways
And the way that she wears her clothes,
Or the way she plays this game (so cold)
She said she came up rough 
And one income was not enough
There'd be nights she'd go to sleep hungry
Cause her mom was always short on food and money
See people used to joke a lot
Tease her bout her clothes not being in style
Dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers
From the finest second hand down Oriental Ave.

Once she graduated junior high she started working overtime
Scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines
Just so she could help her mother out and
After college they moved into Marvin Gardens
And she got a job working at the city water department
To raise enough cash
In move into community chest condos on Pennsylvania Ave
She fell in love with this dude named ray
Who was a small time hustler from St. Charles place

And he was known for always bein' in and out of trouble
But the problem was that he was never on her level
She argued with her mom about ray's work
Til he was sent upstate on the same day that she gave birth
But see the baby never made it, it drove her nearly crazy
And she couldn't take it

[Chorus]

(Listen) see where she came from
Many people find it hard just to hang on
You often find them in the same place complaining
Instead of finding a better way of maintain
She could have balled up and cry
Wished that she would die
And just gave up on tryin'
Instead she grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom now she's on top and she's flying

Like angels losing their wings so they see how it feel to cry
Babies have babies for the welfare coupons
Dudes on the radio rapping, them cats is lukewarm
I get up on it, spit up on it like a new born
The family structure ruptured, there's living proof like a group home
Be-Boy being a man, throw a suit on
Stepping out hotter than ??? when the soup's on
My son like ""Daddy, I be missing you when you gone""
I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
Cause she's like ""That's what they wear in school""
Then she asked me ""Daddy, you know any superstars?""
I looked at her and said ""Stop being silly, that's what you two are""
I say it now and I've said it before
And you can trust me on this cause I've been through it y'all
Follow your heart and you can do it dog
Baby you're a star...

[Musiq Soulchild]
All of the days...
All of the days, of my life I spent on trying to find
Yet another way to show you how, how special you are
There ain't no body, that can take that away from you
No matter what...
Even though...

[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli with Musiq Soulchild harmonising throughout]
Yeah, yo, yo, yo
And even though mummy and daddy might fight all through the night
Argue and fuss, you a part of us that we've got to get right
I don't love you to death, cause I love you to life
And you a teenager, you might not want my advice
You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke
And say things that cut like a patient under the knife
I say this, cause I was once a teenager too
And respect for my peers is really all that I related to
But I made it through, you gonna make it too
So much I wanna say to you...

When I look into her eyes, I see
So much in her that reminds me of myself in awe
She's so beautiful, body, soul, and mind; and I
Just wanna be the one to make her feel good in a special way

I'm a hug and kiss her
And tell her how much I miss her when she's gone

Musiq (Soulchild),"How can I even think, after you made a scene
You and me, good again, like nothing happened
Oh, and it's kinda hard to forget what you said when you left out that door, 
Said you don't love me no more,

And now you wanna (sit and talk)
But you don't really(wanna talk)
You just wanna see if you and the things like the way they used to
You wanted change so you just (walked out)
But your new love didn't (work out)
So, now you think you can just come back and you won (No!)

I thought it was over, but you come back again
(Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back)
I thought it was over, but you come back again
(Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back)

Thought that I had it all figured out,
Had it all planned out far,
There was gonna be a happy ending,
But you chose to let go, don't you know,
Once you leave, there ain't no baby please,
Can we just go somewhere and be alone (and talk)
But I don't really (wanna talk)
Cause you just wanna see if you
Can get things like the way they used to,
You wanted change so you just (walked out)
But your new love didn't (work out)
So now you think you can just come back when you want
[Chorus]

It's nice to know that,

And that's not what I wanna do

So hear is my Dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond ill be gone
Before I change my mind
I'll just stop now and say goodbye

I realize all the promises I've made
To you through the years
And all the times you forgave me
Even when I caused you tears
But I just cant do it cant hurt you again
You might say that I'm less than a man
But this is what I need to do

Said it out your own mouth
I ain't even got to say it

I'm just trying to make this thing right

How could you think that I could ever be better without you
I mean, I could go a few months
But everyday girl I'd be missing you
For me to send you off to another dude
The thought of it is so depressing
You and I both know that we needs this that why

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more

Don't change on me, don't change baby
I'll go half crazy if you choose to leave
That's why I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more

We don't often talk about it baby but we know it's true
It's true, that you were insecure once
Cause someone really did you dirty
But I encouraged you to make it through
Showed you special was apart of you
You did the same for me too

So girl I thank you and I'm so thankful
For the times where we rise and we fall
Nights when we laugh and we talk
Lt's not break up, lets be grateful
That the strain of our arguments only brought us closer spite of it all

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more

That's why I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more

We spend more time on our problems
Instead of trying to work them out to get better
However, lets turn this negative into a positive baby
You believe in you and I
I feel there's a need to try
If I don't fight, I'll regret it for the rest of my life

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more
Who gave you love?

Musiq (Soulchild),"I never wanted a woman that wanted
Me for my name or material things
See
I always hope for a woman that's so sure, emotionally secure
With spiritual faith
A woman that I can trust with all of my secrets
And even listen to all of my issues
A woman who never judge
Me or how I was
She deals with me strictly through love

Someone who will put up with the things
Loving me can bring
But still be there to see us through
Someone who would put up
With the strange and complicated things
Cause I would do the same for her too
Someone who I can be real with
Ain't gotta be perfect
Because loving one another is all that matters
It's not hard to explain
So believe me when I say
That I found all of that in you

All that I hope for a friendship that's so pure
A girl I can talk to bout whatever is on my heart
A woman that needs me
That trust and believes me
That wont take my kindness as some kind of weakness
A woman who bares her soul who is willing to let go
That wants me to lead her but knows how to take control
And when I am feeling down
Cause things are going wrong
She fills me up and makes me feel strong

Someone who will put up with the things
Loving me can bring
But still be there to see us through
Someone who would put up
With the strange and complicated things
Cause I would do the same for her too
Someone who I can be real with
Ain't gotta be perfect
Because loving one another is all that matters
It's not hard to explain
So believe me when I say
That I found all of that in you

You are that someone who loves me
Through all my imperfections
You know my heart is filled with nothing but good intentions
You are the one that told me
Long as we got us
Nothing matters
You are the one that sees the joy through the pain
You are my light through the rain

Know that you're being pursued
Would you play innocent?
Would you just let me in?

Eat where the prices are high
Order whatever you like

Spend a whole day in the bed
Maybe I should start
By saying hello instead

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see 
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease

Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and  yeah they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

So they came to test 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the brothers leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

[CHORUS: ]

I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube (who?)
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a brother and get stomped by an African

Everybody needs to change their way of thinking

It's such a waste of love

I thought it was (I thought it was) but it wasn't
But now I know (I know it's not) what I wanted
No matter how, I tried to make it work
Things only got worse
People try to tell you just be patient
And maybe things will be better

But sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away

Oh, who is to blame, who takes the fall
Cause either way, it's no one's fault
No you can't help, what's truly in your heart
It's who you are (be true to who you are)

I thought that we were so (close, how did we) get so far
It's only now, it's all (over, I see) what went wrong
I guess this is what it means when something ain't meant to be
We should just let it go
And I know you still wanna hold on
Cause you can't believe that your love ain't enough

But sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away

It's the worst thing in life
But I believe that in the end (you'll be alright)
Cause it doesn't work no more
It only hurts (even more)
Ain't nothing 'bout it you can do
So you got to move on cause

Sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away
Just might not be right for you

Sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
Sometimes it's just time to walk away
Might go find who's right for you

Sometimes things just fall apart
And no one wants to be alone
Sometimes it's just time to walk away",Walk Away,2016

The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't want to go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I want to go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you want to do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

Mustang,"J’ai rendez-vous avec une fille
Si sexy : Anne-Sophie
La nuit s’offre à nous Anne-Sophie aussi
Et ses lèvres ont un goût de paradis

Oooh Anne-Sophie…

Depuis le ciel les astres nous voient
Et se se disent qu’on est bien elle et moi
Mais la lune s’ennuie la lune m’envie
Ho même les dieux m’envient Anne-Sophie

Oooh Anne-Sophie…

Avant elle
J’étais si seul
J’étais si seul
J’avais un trou dans le coeur
Et des noeuds plein la tête
Anne-Sophie
Anne-Sophie

Oooh Anne-Sophie…

Elle est si sexe et si blonde
Et ma tête est comme une mappemonde
Où tous les archipels portent son nom
Où toutes les sirènes chantent ma chanson

Oooh Anne-Sophie…",Anne-Sophie,
Mustang,"Je ne veux plus
Me casser le cul
Sur des mélodies
Du temps je n’en ai plus

Je ne veux plus chanter hé hé hé
Je ne veux plus jouer hé hé hé
Je voudrais pouvoir tout oublier

Bye bye les guitares
Bye bye l’harmonie
Pour tout ça c’est trop tard
Voilà c’est fini

C’est fini

J’en ai assez
De faire des couplets
Des ponts et des refrains
Comme au siècle dernier

Je ne veux plus chanter hé hé
Je ne veux plus jouer hé hé hé
Je voudrais seulement tout oublier

Bye bye les chansons
Bye bye les soli
C’était bien c’était bon
Maintenant c’est fini

C’est fini…",C'est Fini,

Belle Dame de Pique
Reine brune angélique
Quand on danse après la fête
Comme un valet et sa princesse
Je ne pense plus à rien
Avec toi je m’sens si bien

Refrain :
Danse danse chérie
Danse avec moi toute la nuit
Danse danse baby
Donne un sens à ma vie

Déjà je ne peux plus vivre sans toi
Et même si tu te moques de moi
Chérie danse, danse avec moi

Tu sais chérie
Toutes les chansons disent que l’amour finit
Et j’ai si peur de te perdre
Je te cherche partout
Ma reine brune

Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Je laisse le jour derrière moi
Le bonheur est si grand
Que je m’endors comme un enfant

Oh chérie la nuit finit
Et demain tout sera moche
Mais avec le soir
À nouveau
Tout reviendra
Quand on dansera
Toi et moi",La  Dame De Pique,
Mustang,"Seul dans ma chambre je fredonne
Une mélodie joyeuse
Et je rêve d’une adorable personne
Je rêve d’amours heureuses

Doop-doo-wop bala…

Mais peu à peu je m’abandonne
À des idées plus vicieuses
Et la belle rêvée se donne
Prenant des poses plus audacieuses

Alors en arrière et en avant
Je l’emmène au firmament

Doop-doo-wop bala…

Elle se plie à toutes mes lois
Qu’est-ce qu’on s’amuse tous les deux
Et elle ne peut aimer que moi
Enfermée au fond de mes yeux

Alors en arrière et en avant
Je l'emmène au firmament

Doop-doo-wop bala…",En Arrière En Avant,

Maintenant je m’lève et c’est l’après-midi
Je m’emmerde…

Je n’allume même pas la radio
Toutes les musiques me rendent marteau
Bébé je m’emmerde…
À toutes les heures de la journée
Bébé j’memmerde à en crever

Dès que tu l’ouvres pour parler
Bébé j’monte le son d’la télé
Tu m’emmerdes…

J’m’emmerde le soir d’vant la télé
Et j’m’endors la nuit sans rêver
Bébé je m’emmerde…

Nouvelle année à rien branler

(Écoute ce beat)
C’est le Roi de La Jungle en personne
Le Roi de la jungle qui me l’a appris
Et je le joue pour toi
Ton coeur contre le mien
Fait un si joli bruit
Allez baby viens

King of the jungle…

Écoute nos coeurs, baby
(Écoute nos coeurs)
Cogner sur le même tempo
Tes hanches s’agitent
Aux rythmiques des bongos
Qui s’emballent baby
Ton coeur contre le mien
Fait un si joli bruit
Allez baby viens

Écoute ton coeur baby
(Écoute ton coeur)
Et viens dans mon bungalow
Le Roi de la jungle
Ne joue pas qu’aux bongos

Et sur c’lui-là baby

À donner d’la voix

Pour un plus beau
Pour un plus chaud
Un plus costaud

Ma bébé me quitte
Me dit « Jeannot,
Au lit lui

Et moi je reste
Comme un enfant
Tout seul et triste
Savoir qu’elle touche
Un autre type
Ça me rend dingue
Dingue dingue

Et ça lui fait
Ni froid ni chaud

Ma bébé me quitte
Et dans tout l’hôtel

Pour un plus chaud

Me dit « Jeannot,
Au lit lui

Mustang,"Tous tous tous mes amis
Portaient les cheveux longs
Des sacs en bandoulières et
De larges pantalons

Tous tous mes amis
Chantaient des chansons
Con-contestataires
À des manifestations

J’ai longtemps supporté
Leurs élans de passion
Oui j’ai longtemps bêlé bêlé
Avec les moutons

Mais je me suis lassé
De leurs conversations
Trop cul-cul la praline et
Des mauvaises chansons

Tous tous tous mes amis
Portaient les cheveux longs
Des sacs en bandoulières et
De larges pantalons
Mais moi…
Je je me suis coiffé
Les cheveux en arrière
Et rentré ma chemise
Dedans dans mon pantalon

Tous tous mes vieux amis
Me traitent de con
De vendu de fasciste mais j’ai
Retrouvé la raison

J’ai déserté les rangs
De la Révolution
Et je serre les dents quand
Ils chantent leurs chanson

À mon pro-propre père
Je fais une réflexion
Lorsque sa chemise
Dép-dépasse du pantalon

Moi qui avais bêlé
Autant avec les moutons
Aujourd’hui je hurle
Avec les loups c’est con

Mais mes nouveaux amis
Fils de notaires ou d’patrons
M’aiment bien et me disent
Qu’j’en ai dans le pantalon

Dans le pantalon…",Le  Pantalon,
