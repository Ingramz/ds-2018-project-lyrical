Your game so tight, you got me feenin'

In other words, ma, I'm due for some kisses, I'm due
for some huggin'
And all them dudes that be buggin', I ain't with it
I'm through the thuggin', I'm due for some lovin'
I need a wife in my life and ma, you're lookin' like
you're due for a husband
I choose not to love 'em
These chicks runnin' around actin' like straight fools
in the public
Let's move with the subject because I came with a
better plot
Just play the game and you'll never flop
It's in your brain, you already hot
But you ain't close to my face, so you better stop

Have you comin out the speakers like the base do,

Raise my arm with the piece and hammer you,
Let the 8 spread, off at your face head,
Watch your face shead sorta like snake's shead,

Her booby wanna back the coochie play some luchie wit' it,

Yo these stories I spit, I seen 'em I wrote 'em
Like a teen he was boastin, ""La Vida Loc'in""
In his dream I awoke him, the Beamer I drove it
It was the beam that I showed him, that I keep by my scrotum
I seen him I showed him, I leand him I told him
The Demons arose and, bullets, pull it
A hour just to clean 'em and load em, doggy
You had a slow summer, I didn't H.2 gold Hummer
Not to mention new Range, no number
And you know the Rover...so move over soldier
Flavor Coca Cola, garage the soda holder!!
And its over over!! here's a clover dojer
I'm that nigga now, everyone that knows ya told ya
Byrd Gang but we live by the codes of Coberas
Hoopties, drive by's, long nose through Nova's
If you dope I dope ya, where the pimps are colder
The end is over, Coroner come roll him over
And I don't just look real, this crook deals coke
Only thing whiter dog is Brook Shields
Harlem, holla back, how the hood feel
Platinum, I'm that real...you that shook deal
Took deals out the building, up the block
Up 29 flights, plugged up with the Roc
Now its...hurtin ya heart to see Dame fuckin wit me
Worse than that, the whole game fuckin wit me
A little beef, a few lames fuckin wit me (Nas)

Over the ones that are dead, we'll put guns to your head
Put dots on your loaf like you was wonder the bread
Sheek, Zeke, hell rell and I got some in the feds

I contradict what ever the government says
For them boys on my back wit them bugs by my bed
They still thinkin' that we coppin' sellin raw
Tryin' to put us through them Rico and them Rockefeller' laws

I'm in L.A. the top down the pedals floored
Wit a hot stiletto whore, suck my cock tell the law
And for you fagots I see past all your cheap stares
Nowadays I see my past from a beach chair, yeah

And I the fellin' so relaxed and refreshin' when chillin'
A total change from movin' crack off the steps of the building's
Rollin' wit gangs in the back of the jects where the killin'
In Park Ave where young Chris body found
A number is all to add to task body count
Watch it boy they'll show you how that shorty bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm the most incredible, to ever do what you cats'll never do, or be able to
I'm ahead of you, 'cause I spit like I never ate
And if I did then I'm just never full
Stop the hoe jokes, I'm not a homo, better believe I'll cock the 4-4
I ain't Mexican, but I'll stretch your man, yes I am a fuckin' vato loco

I went from the pot with cocoa to the block with cocoa
To gettin' locked, catchin' a charge dealin' wit the cops with cocoa
Now I'm just hot like cocoa
You can catch me on the block, being watched, in a drop
The same color as chocolate cocoa

I don't walked in the street, with so much raw in my sneaks
God dam, got home and had corns on my feet
I see the Lord when I sleep and often He speaks
He says Juelz you better than all of these creeps

So I got all my shit light, got on my shit right
Not a lot of thems this nice, but the games funny so I gotta do shit right
So to the ball drop and the world blow up, I'm a twirl shit up
Until my peeps come home, Zeke come home
Better believe I'm a keep on beastin' on

Where should I began our pompous, a thousand wins accomplished
Known throughout the atlas, honest been accomplished
You'll be abolished, men, women, children astonished
The don is the one, jewelry way beyond it

Chunky blessed on the chest, funky S when I dress
Thunder storm damn, monkey wrenching' her fresh
But I cope wit the rain, mad I can't float with my dame
Down to the coastal wit Caine, Maine, my boat is a plane

I land on the water, here I go boastin' again
I keep toast, give a toast, inhale smoke for the pain
Girls gone wild, nope, they goin' insane
All doped off the fame, jump rope with my chain

Now that's off the chain, ma take off your chain
I'm 40 will off your brain, kids will be lost and claimed
'Cause of Walton James, now in the orphan game
Whether adoption or foster it's all the same

Jim's the rider of riders, J are's the writer of writers
Juelz you know him well, hell he the fire of fire
I'm the supplier, baffled that's the hustler
Trifle got a knife for that apple inside your jugular

The big apple, I tackle all the customers
Put it on the apple at the castle, come and fuck with us
And further more, got the birds of raw, I deserve a tour
Hey, hey holla' back, swallow that, that's murda' whore

In a Persian turban, swervin', that suburban mergein'
Curvin', herb in the air, yeah, yeah I'm hurtin' y'all
See I crash and cop it, mash and mop it, blast a rocket
Natural born hustler, yeah crack I stocked it

Now my drugs are legal, so just pass the profit
Three months alone sizzurp will smash the notic

But the stove was off, I was just rollin' hot

Hard body, I'm a rolling block

I don't know them rats, no, I don't condone in that

Normally, I don't ask that
Normally, I just blast that

Your girl told me you just obsessed with pussy
And you can't fuck, you just upset the pussy
I'm somethin' mean to watch

Food for thought, the fuck man you lames been eatin' them lies
I move the streets, do follow, I speed race, why?
Not through the streets 'cause police do follow, so watch 'em

These niggas throw flappy and sick, that's right
We young cold flashy and rich, plus we gun hoe
And SPZ on a bitch 'cause we don't pay for the pussy
The beef cum we don't lay for the pussy

Fuck 'em, watch 'em, got 'em, spot 'em
Pop 'em, drop 'em, lay 'em down
Now Lord, forgive us, pray for us
Gangstas, say what? We all religious
And y'all wangstas I swear you give us the shivers

Dipset, the new black panthers
The boys ask us questions, man, we do not answer
Life's too short for me to pull my pants up
I'm tryna let my nuts hang, system out the truck bang, bang

That's certified gangsta, you heard about me
Well, then you heard about gangsta
I'll beat the brace off a nigga
But I'm tryna keep the tapes off a nigga

To get rich we do whatever we have to do
And when we hit the hood our presence be grabbin' you

Squeeze 3 and have any OG bitchin' up

Our big shots, so doc can't stitch him up

I'm from the city where it's easy to make doe
Easy to bake hoes, it's easy to make 4's
You gettin' them pencils, the pigs and the checks know
Next week they'll have you sittin' on stake road

From HOC to CF to CF
Can't hold me, I'm prone to this BS
So imagine Bez on the phone gettin' key check
Fresh outta DC lampin' in the GS

That's how niggas do go get a clip or 2
Fifth or glock, get a block, hit the spot, flip a few
And for a brick or 2, the led I carry, shit
I'm reditary and your kids could get it too

Juelz Santana,"Daddy? 
Daddy? 

Daddy? (just to hear you breathing)
Damn man this shits crazy
Got a little son now, little me
Runnin' around, its crazy
I'd do anything man, do anything
Life is precious, remember that.

And if I die then my child'll be a bastard

I just had a newborn,
Shorty weighs 7 pounds, 6 ounces, 20 inches, too strong,
I'm happy now, I'm a daddy now,
I gotta be there, I ain't get to see my daddy around,
We ain't never get to ball out kid,
I was young, the game caught him before I did, but
Back to you son, as for you son,
I'd do any and everything, that's the truth son,
From the dirtiest diaper, till you get old enough to dirty your nikes up,
I'm your clean up man,
You ever need a hand, need a foot, need a heart, need a lung,
Reach for the phone, call me up son,
Yes, everything drops for you, everything stops for you,
I'll bury a block for you,
I'll let go every shot for you, and I'll reload the clip, just to make sho he's hit

[Chorus]
I gotta little boy to look after,
I gotta little boy to look after,
Said I gotta little boy to look after,
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard 

Everyday I look in your face, I sit back and I smile,
Look at his face, its just like mine, wow,
Damn, this kid shines,
Authority and prioritys, this kids mine, so,
That means I gotta beat him if I have to,
Keep him out of bad schools, teach him how to rap smooth,
Show him the ropes like, make sure his rope's tight,
No screws loose, no loose screws,
Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect,
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left,
You ever get craze for candy, don't take a strangers candy,
Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candys,
I'm your rider, your guider, pusher, provider,
But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you,
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you,
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom,
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

[Chorus]

I raise you up in the sky, like behold,
The only thing greater then I, YOU, my greatest achievement,
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it,
Without you I can't make or succeed shit,
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit,
You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,
You lace em up tight, you fall, get up fight,
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights,
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours,
So you just keep handling yours.

Remember Santana was next
Now its not techs, its checks and fancy collects
I want his wrist, fist, whole had, jammed with baguettes

Word to my grand ma he one bad mamma jamma, damn
So I don't write for the stardom
I get, booted, zooted, write down my problems
I've been through it headed right for the bottom
D.C. naw, would've been a sniper in Harlem (so what)

That's why I throw some doe to my cody from Kosovo
Help me get on overflow (shhh) no one suppose to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister
Thousand grams of dope smellin' like Hine Vinegar
That was a lot to linger, but to the top I bring her

But when it came to dope, I always copped in fingers
Money missin', oh shit I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrist, that's when they said oh shit he's not a singer
Fuck the rap, fuck the movies, fuck Siskel and Ebert
This pistol I'll squeeze it, missiles if needed (killa)

Remember I'm gonna spend my cake
Remember Jim we getting out of five eights (projects)
Now chefs will fry us steaks (that's true) it's a higher stake
Swiss accounts I'm goin' show you how to wire cake
And we from BBQ, now you a CEO, direct a video 

Your own album here we go
That's my man anytime I holla, holla with me
We shared chicken sandwiches they was a $1.50
But you seven dollars, nickel bag and white owl
I hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night child

Magical pops gone, shit tragical
Mom's on mission, my house is where the attics chill
I'm like a teacher, I need me a sabbatical

Its not irrational, I grew up radical

Cold night sold white duckin' the fam full of spooks...(watch the squalies)

I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down, 
Puttin' paper in my pockets grindin' all year round' 
I'm on the block with the gangstas stayin' two toes down I'm on the grind.
I'm on the grind all night until the sun come up, 
Countin' cash up in the cut tryin' to make me a buck, 
I'm making moves stacking paper cause I'm handelin' ya, I'm on my grind.

Check it out baby.
I got money on my mind, big frank on my brain, 
Intoxicated by visions of chains and diamond rings, 
One thing here to obtain is fortune forget the fame 
Been ballin' since back in the game been changin the strings, 
These lames tend to complain its a goddamn shame 
You think you flier than a plain but you washed up in the drain, 
Baby paint the picture frame its all work no play, 
My hustle schedule is simpley all night all day, 
I'm snapping like paparazzi I'm plotting on Maserati 
Been grinding since lotty dotty 
Trying to earn that pay collecting that green paper 
I'm scheming and pulling capers 
I'm giving these brouds the vapers 
From the fold to the tray.
I'm on the grind

[Chorus]

My hustle is Godzilla, my muscle is king kong,
My mind is Einstein, my flow is off the dome, 
My grind is dope feen addicted to counting green, 
My money is bill gates my ballin' is yow ming, 
I'm not impressed with bling I'm more conserned with ching, 
Grinding since I was a teen, money over everything, 
See I'm all about that paper stacks and bank rolls 
The lack on fo's with drank cold and dank roll.
Hustle is my hobby inspired by johnny gotti call me, 
Give me the wallet because its time to collect, 
V-S up in the johnny watch shining so clear 
The face look like a mirror call it time to reflect.
I'm on the grind

Damn man this shits crazy
Got a little son now, little me
Runnin' around, its crazy
I'd do anything man, do anything
Life is precious, remember that.

And if I die then my child'll be a bastard

I just had a newborn,
Shorty weighs seven pounds, six ounces, twenty inches, too strong,
I'm happy now, Ima daddy now,
I gotta be there, I ain't get to see my daddy around,
We ain't never get to ball out kid,
I was young, the game caught him before I did, but
Back to you son, as for you son,
I'd do any and everything, that's the truth son,
From the dirtiest diaper, till you get old enough to dirty your Nikes up,
I'm your clean up man,
You ever need a hand, need a foot, need a heart, need a lung,
Reach for the phone, call me up son,
Yes, everything drops for you, everything stops for you,
I'll bury a block for you,
I'll let go every shot for you, and I'll reload the clip, just to make sho he's hit

Look at his face, its just like mine, wow,
Damn, this kid shines,
Authority and priority's, this kids mine, so,
That means I gotta beat him if I have to,
Keep him out of bad schools, teach him how to rap smooth,
Show him the ropes like, make sure his rope's tight,
No screws loose, no loose screws,
Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect,
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left,
You ever get craze for candy, don't take a strangers candy,
Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candies,
I'm your rider, your guider, pusher, provider,
But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you,
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you,
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom,
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

[Chorus]

I raise you up in the sky, like behold,
The only thing greater then I, you, my greatest achievement,
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it,
Without you I can't make or succeed shit,
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit,
You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,
You lace 'em up tight, you fall, get up fight,
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights,
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours,
So you just keep handling yours.

Its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
Think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever, 
So I want to write my words on the face of today.
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and they'll say, 
Hey look at him and where he is these days.

I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the, M-5 pedal, when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious, and I, know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

Well that's what the fuck they gon need
'Cause I'mma bury these niggas this time around

Who better than me, you better than me
Shit you never will see if you dead and deceased
Keep two', lead, and the piece and I'm busting it off right
Leave a trail of smoke like a fucking exhaust pipe
Took the coke up out the stash cause they know about the stash
Now I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, yeah sown up in the bags 
I do my chicks like Ludacris blow it out your ass
I'm a mean pimp you know what I mean pimp
Four hoes on each strip all bringing me chips
Futuristic, so when I'm gon they gon have to do ballistics 
Just to prove I'm this sick
You niggas need to be spank by your mami
For ever thinking you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short late waist pack money 
I get that all straight a.s.a.p. money bring it here now!

[Chorus: x2]
Touch the coke, touch the pot, add the soda what you got me!
I am what I am I be what I be and that you will see I am crack!!

Who want it with I you want it with I 
I'll shoot one of ya eyes
You'll lose one of ya eyes
I'll jam move and slump ya
Leave your body in ranch cuckamonga with ants moving under
My flows so in order I can turn soap and water to ocean water and float the border
You never will be what I forever will be 
Your tombstone never will read we buried a G nope!!
I'm so mean and nice with the things I write 
Jesus might say Jesus Christ
It's only rap so why y'all trying to hold me back
Like y'all ain't ask for to owe me back I'm here!
My peoples play and sling cocaine
More than Billy Blanco from Carlito's Way
So you can find me on the streets okay 
With that big fucking piece okay

[Chorus: x2]

Too dope for this but you won't admit 
So my two's smoking spit make you choke on spit
You ever seen a man gag and gargle
Sound like a new born trying to ask for bottles 
They like cut it out you slacking
But I bust it out in rapping 
Can you name a nigga better without me busting out in laughing?
Nigga you couldn't spit enough to get at me 
I'll stretch ya for extracurricular activity
I'm more macing than grace is when I say shit
You should say amen after my name kid
Yes this is that of greatest
You should say amen after this statement

Nah

I mean, you mutha fuckas don't realize, how real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family, protect what's right
Ya Dig! 

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much he pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause' he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause' sister was sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'cause' he was good at handlin coke and Jose liked that
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there n hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up n spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came frome
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
So they let him go thinkin he would tell them where Jose kept the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
And he said there's no way out that
He said shoot em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And next minute someone blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on old man's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no mans great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
And he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

[Outro]
The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes
You surprised? Don't be man, It's just real shit
Holla at ya boy dipset, AYE!",Lil' Boy Fresh,2005

Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back

How to get that shit how to twist that wrist

And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
I guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one four org

Copped ten sold five then I hide three
Baking soda residue I'm gone with the other two

We got Cash Money on the table layin' underneath the flo'

Aye but I really got a pan when I hit the blo
Shit aye this beat is so

Man, first I just wanna salute my soldiers
Knahmean? We just trying to stay above water
Feel me? I mean I speak for the Gs, the hustlers
They understand me, knahmsayin?
Shit
Lock into this time and lock out (always)
I mean ain't nothing promised to niggaz like us
You know?

[Juelz Santana]
Just a, another day another dollar
Now look what you got
Another hater, another plotter
Shit, you know the drill
A brother pay, a brother holla
Watch 'em, they creeping
Another raid, another copper
Aw man
Another case, another lock-up
What
Another bail, know that cake better pop up
Yup
That's just day to day shit we go through
And results of the day to day shits we go through
Some niggaz day to day pitch, they local, and
Some niggaz day to day bricks, they coastal, and
Some niggaz day to day snitch, they vocal
I don't honor them fools
Them type of dudes get they tonsils removed
I speak from the heart of the hood
From the boarded up apartments with wood
From the cracked down crack houses (yeah)
To the burnt up black houses
To fiends inside with that burnt up glass out
And puffing weed makes my actions switch
I'm at the window, with the pistol, like Malcolm
Ain't that a bitch (man)
And I'm paranoid, paranoid
But still I got to get it, got to have it, make it happen boy

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take
And may this song play all the way
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me

[Juelz Santana]
Look now
Another dead, another born
Vice versa
Another here, another gone
Pay attention
Another smile, another mourn
Another funeral, another baby shower going on
Get it, huh
That's just life in the hood
You earn scars, you earn stripes in the hood
Huh, get it
I live the life of a hustler
No sleep all night for a hustler, buster
And if your coke weak, cut it with Bo Peep sheep
I swear fiends will chase that high for four weeks
I'm still dealing with the day to day beef and
Stress, hunger, patience
The day to day basics
Yep, shit that we go through, you know
Shit
Look at the shit that we go through, you know
Niggaz come home, can't get jobs
Niggaz getting money, acting like they can't get robbed
And that don't mix

They hand you the snub
Dismantle your mug
A head shot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs
The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

[Chorus]

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (Ay)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (Ay)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (Ay)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (Ay)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (Ay)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (Ay)

[Chorus]

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S.
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack
Come see me, little nigga, I'll give you a gat like
Here, here's a hammer nigga
Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga
Here, go murk a nigga",Violence,2005

Cold sweats (sweaty sheets)
From bad dreams (nightmares)
I hope the Feds don't grab the team
'Cause we been labeled as the trouble makers (Dipset)
We sell whole pies so you ain't got to cut the cake up
Tell no lies, so the Lord come and take us (solemnly swear)
Praise to Allah, hope the Lord He forsake us (pray for me)
And outlaws is what it made us
We live the fast life, and so we ball out major (ballin')
Until I see a ribbon in the sky
Cop plush cars put ribbons on the ride (full speed ahead)
Due to my political ties
I can't roll around without the drip in the ride (East Side)
And if my gun boys ain't heard of ya
You're lightweight I get the young boys to murder ya
You're looking at a cracker's worst nightmare
Young, black, rich and with a fresh pair Nikes
Boy you talk about my life here
Fuck wit' OGs that put dice in the mirror
And they tell me that life's but a gamble

Five thousand spent on pants, man (man)
Bitches love it, nigga's want it
So bad they wanna take it, but I kill 'em for it (huh)

You better stay out the forest, warning
It's Santana you fucks,
Money man, make you do a handstand for the bucks
I see you clear, my antennas is up
And that hand-scale is still in my pocket
What you want? (What you want?)
Dough boys in the trap, where ya at? (where ya at?)
Coke dealer's in the hood, what's good? (what's good?)

To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

It goes yes, yes yo, fresh to death balla
You can play hard, under pressure I'm stoned
We playin' tight D, I'm in the paint like a G
Some say they gangstas but they ain't like me

Came from an environment, came I was firin'
Then hit the dealers see the range I was buyin'
Don't test drive like a whole whip like you should
Shoving up pies, a whole whip that you should

Then take the proceeds, waist about four G's
Bottles in the club tryin' to get the home and skeez
I'm tryin' to get the dame to breeze
But she putting up a fight like Layla Ali

Middle name 40 on the wrist
Last name you can't afford me bitch

New York to Miami bitch
Bitch, I'm in the life of a hood star, rock star without the guitar
Got em' all rubbin' they bitch bra

Got em' all shakin' their tush like
I'ma givin' 'em a taste of the good life
But I give 'em a taste of the good liquor, a taste of the good bud
Next thing you know she'll be tastin' my good

I see it, I like it, I buy it

Flyin' at his highest, climb it

Where are my homies? Yup I'm so hood

Add a little baking soda, make it foam like aftershave
I like to serve my dope wet, cause it weigh a hella lot mo'
You can smell the residue and the fumes from next do'
Ughhh, turf superstar, microwaves and pickle jars
Portable digital scales, custom painted muscle cars
Pimpin where the razor blade? Use a safety pin
What they goin fo'? Nigga what you tryin to spend?
When it's a drought I just sit on my dope and wait
For the prices to skyrocket and rise like real estate
I got that ice cream, that candy, that girl, that white white white
My car's a Charger 2006 Hemme, tight tight tight
I'm a d-boy, BOOTCH, I thought you knew

She white, she bright, she shine like a pearl
And I ain't talkin 'bout Lindsay Lohan
I'm talkin 'bout that sniff that blow man, what that
One hit that'll get you open
Might make your nose bleed, if it's potent
So if you're not ready, homey don't tamper with it
She the chick who had Tony Montana slippin
She so bad she make you mad
But soon as you get mad, she make you cash
That white girl, but she ain't always that light
She ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white
Nope; gimme one girl, I mean one gram
I'll teach how to give a white girl a suntan
Put it in that pot, 'til it get that hot
Then start to Sir Mix-A-Lot

I like 'em black, brown, Puerto Rican or Asian
But nothin bring the bread back like a caucausian
Whether, winter fall, summer or spring
A white girl's always down for doin the damn thing (fo' sho')
Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk
Got a white girl drivin with white girls in the trunk (hold up)
I ain't lyin, it's the best thing goin
When my white girl's around, it's always snowin
Momma cain't stand her, tellin me to switch
Sayin I'ma go to jail fuckin with that white bitch (no shit)
Always around to keep me paid
With some white girls on my team, I got it made
So if you down on your luck, and got no money

I keep them stiff broads when I'm fuckin with the hogs
Cause they never get stopped by the motherfuckin cops
Bootch look hard but the bitch is a fraud
Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock a rock
Move around bitch, you need to get out the way
I keep a young Suzy when it's time to move yay
You need to learn the game befo' you try to play
Cause like Calgon, them laws'll take you away
So I keep me a snow bunny, ridin in the front
With a triple zillion head and a platinum cunt

Hello World, Sup everybody, I'm speaking to all the ppl out there.
There comes a time to where, you have to know, who you are,
(Dipset, Skoal game)
And what you are, to overcome things
Oh and by the way, My name is K-L C
The drum ma, ya heard me?
But this not about me, This is about the PPl's Champ
From Houston Texas, My Partner, Paul Wall,
Tell em who you are!

I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)
I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)
I'm gettin' money stayin' true, chasin' paper what it do,
I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)

I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)
I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)
I'm gettin' money stayin' true, chasin' paper what it do,
I'm a real motherfucker what are you? (what are you)

I'm grindin' like a rotor, and I'm postin' like a sticky note
Stackin' up that paper, pockets fatter than a dukie rope,
Boys lookin' sick, But that docta got that antidote,
Hatin' cause they broke suckers, fake as a 30 spoke.

I'm watchin the stock quotes, I'm real as a pac,
But these clowns be actin' funny, like a knock knock joke,
They cramp on my style, cause I got money and power,
My paper long as the nile, so how them hatas like me now?

Them bustas on the prow so I'm ten tokes down,
I'm puttin' all y'all to sleep so put on your night gown,
Some tattoos and a ice grill don't make you real,
These cats be actin' frauder than a 4 dollar bill.

I'm a gun holdin', blunt smokin', paper chasin', ladie banger,
Fly boy somethin' like a aviator,ha yeah,
I'm you girls super hero, her caped crusader,
So go head and hate me cause I hate a hater.

It take money to make money I said,
So you gotta have dough to make bread where I'm From,
I ain't chew get it, I stay true with it,
Barbed wire flow, don't get tangled in it,

Real nigga yes, all about the hustle,
Till I get that call from god sayin,""I want you""
I been trough it, I past struggle, thats right,
Every day I in the street trying to complete a mad puzzle

White coupe, pedal mashed down,
Seats soft like I sat on hash brownies,
I get money, don't ask me, ask 'round,
Big money like I work downtown.

[Chorus]

I'm one hundred, but them other boys frontin',
They just sideline commentating, we call it dumb fuckin',
They sweet as apple pie, as they spreadin' them lies,
They smile up in your face but so quick to jump F

You swear they so cool, but they turn like doorknobs,
They say they hardcore, but they friendlier than spongebob,
I'm tryin' to stay afloat, stayin' up on my note,
So that Highness is what I tote, affordin' the overcoat.

I roll with a platoon that'll put you in your tomb,
And then mark up your body like Mr. Cartoon,
Its real in these streets when you chasin' that guap,
Cause that hatin' around the clock, will it ever stop,
Probably not.

Watch the bubbles overlap while I pour one in the glass
I came here to watch you, baby, to watch you
Don't be afraid of the couch cause, baby, I got you

Better yet, go and get up, I ain't gon' tell you again
Why don't you stand over me and let me see what it is
And maybe my tastin' with your rotation
Will show you why I couldn't wait to get to the crib

Damn you feel so good to me
I figured I should just take some time
And only do what a man needs to do
When a man there to keep his woman pleased

Wanna make sure that you come again
Wanna be the one you call again

Go on and put your hands around it
Damn, you put your hands around it

If I play with that, think about it
Do that lil' thing around it
Don't you dare try to leave without this
Just keep doin' what you're doin'

Don't, don't take it out, baby, don't take it out
You could take as much time as you want, take it out
Trust me, I won't hit that and be gone
Just fulfill all your needs

From her head to her clothes, how she throw it on
But I'm tryin' to see her take it off

I plan on goin' deep
You the ground, I'm the casket, I'm goin' six feet
Yeah, baby, I'm a fully loaded freak
One in the head, don't make me bust off my piece

Them other dudes soft like sheets
Me, I'm tryin' to get you on my sheets
Tobago shorts say 'pink'
Oh, those Victoria's Secrets

And I know how to keep a secret
So I won't tell nobody what we did
No but we could chill and pop Heavy bottles
We can ride in the Phantom while the Bentley follows

And since then we've been inseparable
Cause I did everything to get next to you
Since day 1 you know I stay true
So ever since then it's been me and my boo

Toilet paper on the side for example homie

I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and
While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car
Smoking out with the doors ajar
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island
Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money its my i.d

Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk

There's nothing in this world
There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
There's nothing in this world
There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
Cos me love life's so right 
When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight
Cos he fills up my life
Like the Sun, he shines bright
Boy, come with me now

The first night me meet her
Yes me senorita me never want to leave her no
Because the gal look sweet and treat
And me really want to take her home

Cos she look nice and is a one of a kind 
When me look up in her eyes then she got me mesmerized
Picture perfect like a Kodak moment
When she kiss me goodnight and she feeling up on me

We been there from the jump, never front, never stunt
Never done what a average girl done
And I can tell by her body language
She feels my emotions

And got me anxious

And me love the way you flex too
We could chill girl, after school
Cos I ain't tripping girl it's up to you

Cos I did everything to get next to you
Since day 1 you know I stay true
So ever since then it's been me and my boo

Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich

Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get,
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip, 
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it,

Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon' head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt,
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt Like I couldn't really give it my all,
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall,
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me,
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't no where to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now 
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old, well it's good I'm young
'Fore my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one?
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me,
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here

Juelz Santana,"Ether boy! Hey!

How we ball in the club I know you hate it

All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!

We need more bottles tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinking bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up
(Hey!) If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (The 60)
Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back
Money in the bank man you know don't stop that (Stop that stop that stop that!)
(Oh!) Now we trying to get up in the club
(Oh!) Try to tell me no cause I'm rolling with the thugs
(We got money bitch!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buying out the bottles
(Oh!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standing on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was balling hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
Shit! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stopping at the light

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancing on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!

Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin' but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it

I wanna see you dance, see you dance

Rock star! (rock on)
Rock star! (rock on)
It's rock n roll! (rock on!)

I got ladies that love my ladies
Haters that hate my haters
I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On)
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax

Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick,l like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the four iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf
Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?)
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?)
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin', they yellin' 'Where that Nirvana?'
The crowd is rockin' n rollin', them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my lighter up?'
Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'm a 'Puff'
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby)
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby)
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!)

Rock 'n' roll fly
Bitch behold I
I am the shit
Hear the commode cry
Hear the guitar scream
That Double R lean
And if it's for me
Then its foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes
I mean my hos, I mean my flows
You dress different round then me I'm a clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the penal code
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hos
World tours, walkthroughs and T.V. shows
My hair's out (Hey!)
No Shirt (Hey!)
I stage dive (Rock Rock!)

I crowd surf (Hey!)
I'm a hot boy
I'm on my hot shit
Reportin' to you live from the mosh pit

I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, i got em rockin' they pelvic-bones
And losin' clothes
The higher my album sales get
They love me, that's right you nailed it
They treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know i ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer
Groupies tyrin' to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas

We gonna keep on rockin' n rollin' till the wheels fall off.

We the new Red Hot Chili Peppers
We on fire
Sold out arenas
Tearin' up tour busses
You Know how we get down. HaHa
Rock on, hol up, hol up, hol up

Let me drop a jewel on ya, put a roc in air 
Can I call you nana 'cause you got that rockin' chair 
It go back, and forth - then forth and back 
When I'm on Patron, or off the yak 
Can't get off the fact I'm off my Mac 
Goldie probably wouldn't, but I would trick off a that 
And I'm sick with the money, I can cough a stack 
I can sneeze some g's so baby let's roll..

Body shape just like a bottle

She revvin' me up, I got my hand all on my throttle 
I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the Yamaha 
So you can call it switchin' gears 
Zoom in inside of her 
And if it taste how it look I'ma try to swallow her 
Call me Mr. Shoe-shine, baby I'ma polish ya 
And I leave ya spit clean, I don't use no polisher 
Demolition man, tell your friends I demolish ya 
Plus I'm that nigga, baby I could make you popular 
So get another shot of that Ciroc in ya

In a whole 'nother galaxy 
Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality 
Melt your imagination and mold it into reality 
Your heart's my art gallery, girl 
Can you feel the pictures that I painted 
'cause all of them are related, like a mother to a son 
But none of them overrated 
There no others, you the one 
Our destiny is to make it 
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world 
Its so real, an inspiration for no reason 
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangeable 
The thought is sensational, its perfect bliss 
I'm ready to take the milky way to your Hershey's kiss 
You know my tongue's got batteries in it 
The bedroom, we lose calories in it and start families in it 
And don't worry 'cause the situation's under control 
So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul (Luda)..

Jugg's Revenge,"By the time I heard 
They told me you were gone 
It nearly sent me through the floor 
A thousand times I thought 
I still don't understand 
What you were living for 
I felt the pain build up inside of me 
Once through the door you walk away 
The other side you can be free 

I took a look inside of all the dreams you had 
And all the talent that was gone 
But now my life keeps moving 
Knowing all the way 
Your memory is living on 
Since you left I had to search through all the blame 
The string of lies that you were fed 
Some people just don't get their actions have a price 
Playing games with others head",Forever,1996
Jugg's Revenge,"We just try to 
Go through life 
Bold and unafraid 
We do our best 
So we'll never regret 
All the choices that we have made 

We're not exactly 
Where we want to be 
We just try to take it 
Day by day 
Our family is small 
But we're walking tall 
Right through the mess 
We made 
We are one 
I think of all the 
Shit I've been through 
And I thank God that 
Our hearts held true 
So as we go through 

This rough ass ride 
We'll sing anthem 
For ourselves tonight 
In this song we will 
Not sing about some 
Fight that happened long ago 
We are celebrating a battle with 
A far greater foe 
The fact that we can 
Write this song 
Is a freedom that we 
Won't let go 

We don't know what's ahead 
We're just playing out our hand 
With this song we'll 
Come together and 
United we shall stand 
I dream of a place 
Where things are free 
Where anyone can be 
What they want to be

This rough ass ride 
This song's for us tonight",Anthem,1999

Broken promises 
Fading after time 
Apologies instead

Run to only fail 
To catch the last train out 
Just before it derails 
Lived and learned a lot 
Forgetting all detail 
What happens when it's time to go to bed 
Sigh and say goodnight 
The dreams that you once had 
Can only live in side your heart 
Just another empty hand 
To hold before you crash 
Take me back to the start 
Just another extension 
No time for explanations 
Just settling for exceptions 
No time for explanations 
What happens after all of you are gone 
Find somebody else 
Dangling your prize 
Lay your trip upon

As true as it was 
Bring the next one on",No Time,1999

How fast you time runs out 
Life has cheated you so what 
Nothing ever goes as planned 
Some people tell you everything that you want to hear 
Fact is a day-job and a complex only kept them there 
You can wait there standing in that line 
It's easy to blame somebody else 
You have your whole like to do something 
And that's not a lot of time 
In a perfect world
We wouldn't spend our time doing something that we should 
I was sad to see you go 
But if anything 
It taught me something that I didn't know

Juggaknots,"[Queen Heroin]
Asides from gettin in you, the words will stain you
Permanent like ink in epidermis, from tattoo artists
To scar this, thought of partnership you may have fought
For this position and status, this entrepeneurship
Matter of fact, madness I planned this like serial killers are banished
Flows aquatic like fishes' surroundings, underground and
It's pounding, like pregnancies, with the expectancy
Of three times three, use my mental nine to climb
Like gladiator on wall, on call like physicians
To deliver my labor you savor the flavor like Punisher to the cure
A parent's birth picture, evade mixture of offspring
Ring ring the alarm, cause I set strong cases of fire
From my wire connections and disconnections
To settin sparks cause then I'm wettin, microphone checkin
Disrespectin amateurs plus they mentors don't be a sore sport
If it's meant yours, just pretend I liked yours

I can be a bit demanding, acceptin, nothing less than the best
I don't just flip shit anyone can kid, I stick the landing
And stand out, amongst most so don't stress
Trying to touch us, you can't come close like phone sex
I stay ahead of the pack, if you fuckin with Treds
Know that I cover the spread so always bet on black
I'll give you your money's worth, serve up somethin delicious
While, most of these rappers be makin my tummy hurt
Got me upset, sick of these crabs who can't kick it
All addicted to rhyming, I'ma stick them in rehab
Get em cleaned up you know, show em the light that they're
All bark and no bite, like a tree trunk
We slash and burn em, Indelibles, The Fire In Which
Suckers are finished, may they flow, rest in pieces
Cause we're dominating, so while they're busy happy
Just to be nominated son, we give acceptance speeches
Takin the crown, front doors, breaking em down
We some BAD MOTHERFUCKERS, that's what many said
They also said, your time will come, it's time to take it cause
We just couldn't stand the wait like Jenny Craig

Now that's my man the scripture puzzler, bringin a pain device disguiser
For infinite wisdom seeker knowledge of life rhyme provider
?on dudes that just strip time codes down for my feet?
To master one-twenty-four bits at ninety-six KhZ
While you just now trying to get up on Dungeon D&D
Thinking Indelibles will crash and burn you must be lazy and obscene
We fire sequential flyers, my verse ?provides wrecks in concert D?
Slingin em 40 bottles frozen from rooftops and projects
Beware watch below for falling objects, rupturing your optical
Two one-hundred watt mono blocks is optional
To try to match wits with the Diamondback unstoppable
Background poseurs fiend for limelight exposure
When we rally back touch the microphone playtime is over
Who's trying to see the CF graf crew that visualize
Top to bottom, and stand out in New York like an L.A. gang tag do
Master of mathematical empirical principal
Metallic medicinal, mixed with herbs, science and mineral
Yo crews start to walk, when we crack the five series hood
Disengage the ?passive, rip open an issue casing?
Trying to sidestep backwards when it's this rhymer that you facing

Aiyyo, the bullseye pulls my leg and beggin for mercy
My verse be the Don King-in, come out swinging
I'll to kill it, apply my skill shit and the floor's coming
Who ain't feelin my joint, so what that mean your jaw's numbing?
Chill let me stop, gotta get my joint dislodged
And retire armies of niggas, with my dishonorable discharge
And get real, pulling from deep and you gots to play up?
You talk about, ""Respect mines,"" steady missin your layups
Hoes to foes, I start staring, wild truculant
Heart tearing style, fuck you then, order your demise
I'm well stocked, shell shocked, describin the bombs alarms
Incoming, when drum and vocal localize
For niggaz talkin bout Lucci, must be modeling Susan
Erika Kane bitch like, reputation for losing
Listen do you hear voices saying, ""Damn that's a sucker""
Paranoid, looking like Fuzzy Zoeller at the Rukas

Hey yo my nihilist, stylus, cuts matter the finest
The prime of the sequence hides my vicious defense assignment
Your cacophonic visuals bond strictly to bitch tissue fissure
Yeah, the burn from what I'm worth operation
I hate, let's exterminate bandwidths and communicate physically
Bezerk non happers will sleep on third rails for their cemetery
Enlist as, from small pox to syphillis, all stars
Shit on punchlines insidious kid, that you barf off
Only buck fifty you ever handed out was with a Metro card
I can fit the sum of your Tom Thumb concepts in a thimble
Simple bitches, Doctor Death lacing barbed wire stitches
A herd of mad cows bust through brick walls like Jumanji
Sixty-Five upsetter, malicious sickness scatalogics
Prophets turned skeptics, skeptics found Jesus
Right-Wingers turned leftist, everybody jumped on the dick of independence
Sorry we don't want you anymore get lost kid find an exit
Bugged, isn't it? Huh, live you fuckin suckers
I woulda been a witness to collapse your fame squadron
Pardon me, still a fan trying to understand how to be a master

When dabblin with babblin
I sends the battle scene to the apocalypse
With this you grab my cock ya lips 
Be gettin sorta puckery
Gettin the Brewin gassed to save that ass come stop the fuckery
My style'll leave ya posin like a hitch hiker
Make me want to bitch microphone slap that shady ass, you bullshit nigga
Your frontin said you didn't think too hot of me
But once you feel the vocal sodomy you'll say, ""You got it, G""
I finds the virgin ears I'm bustin raw pops
Ya savin the drops, tryin to analyze my DNA, the verbal blueprint
Even if you spend eternity you're baffled, nigga
Havin not the slightest clue of how I'm swingin
Bringin styles and flow that's nastier than urine
See my shit is pure and ghetto embellished demonic funk and all that good shit
A bad nigga when it comes to grabbin mics
I love all women of the spectrum, fuck around I'm stabbin dykes
And as I hurt em I convert em, when it comes to honey dip skits 
I'm leavin pussies sore as if you just delivered triplets, I flip shit 
When niggas say the brewin doesn't rhyme slick 
I yokes em in the Heimlich just to get the fuckin garbage out ya throat 
Mentally hardcore 
There be no guard for defendin against the shit I'm sendin 
Once you're comprehendin the ill funk aphrodisiac 
Givin the hoodies woodies as I'm fuckin up the head like brass knuckles givin noogies

I be's the hell fire word reaver 
Even Ripley can't believe 
I pull a stunt as if my name was Colt Seaver 
AKA The Fall Guy
I never score, why?
I'm hittin like Mattingly
Get your fuckin Webster's dictionary 
Look under ""fat"" and you'll see my profile so smile 
You're grinnin like the Joker
Cause I chose to smoke a mic and let you witness 
Get this through your thick skull: my shit is deadly 
I kicks my verse, niggas couldn't offer competition with a medley of their works
I smirks when booty niggas try and grab this 
Survival of the fittest call me fuckin Tony Atlas, at the podium 
I pours my sodium in open flesh wounds as I mesh tunes with the vocal joint 
To become the focal point
Brothas of funk soon discover I be +deeper+ than that nigga Larry Fishburne's +cover+
Hover on the L, sorta like a stealth in the night
Then I makes the party +jump+ even when it's full of +white men+ 

Check it out
I represent enlightenment 
That have you squintin 
Hintin to rewards of the lord's charity received with clarity 
I heave skillaful syllable is the brick I stick in music mortar 
Makin ya think and raisin my floor to architect

I comes to spark a teck
Mind barrages massages carressed in peace 
The vocal acupuncture your stress released 
Like a hymen crack in my rhymin slack and never that 
Styles mysterious like under LL's hat

The curious become the furious and play the jury
Thus I'm found guilty labelin my sound filthy with the gutter in my utter 
A fat bitch goes, ""Me me me"" 
I cut her in pieces kill her sisters daughters and nieces 
Anything related to such a thought 
I crush I fought hard representin wicked Juggaknot minds 
I breaks it down to your English
I makes you say, ""I'm gooder""

What y'all know about them wild niggas
Devil child niggas
Have-you-kick-the-bucket-say-fuck-it-and-smile-niggas
The type to catch the Buddha buzz, slide up to the fuzz
Sayin ""Officer, run your shotty before I catch this body""
I knew this nigga Smokey, sorta like his pistol
Barrel when you're in peril and shit like that was wanted
But later that would die down,
Sorta like many abandoned that he ran with
His block felt sorta haunted
His only solitude was wifey, word to life, G it seemed
They was together forever and now the womb had been seeded
He needed a job and the robbin wouldn't do it
He wasn't tryin to go out like Diquan in Strapped
Her mother was a nurse, her purse was chubby
From the hospital she found Smokey some work and shit was lovely
With some cream in here, feed a patient there, he had loot
And not a nigga on the street would have to get that pocket tapped
He's workin in maternity and learnin
Seein much about the infant children
To be skilled in fatherhood
Stealin baby stuff home for self
And he didn't have to pull the Mac-20 off the shelf and get...

Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....

In Maternity, Smokey saw stuff, raw stuff,
Make-you-drop-your-jaw-stuff, hospitals get sorta wild
He saw some babies shakin, awakin if they were fortunate
His soul was scorchin, it would have thinkin of his child
Later there would be no ""Honey, I'm home,""
Strictly ""Woman if you jeopardize my seed, dead up, I leave you wet up""
On the block, a flock of zombies entranced
By the peddlers of temporary ghetto heaven had him fed up
His job was gettin hard to fuck with
They had even had him stuck with the disposal of the stillborn
Poisoned by the nourishment, the ill torn soul from flesh
From the womb to tomb
Seein shit like that'll have you crazy
That night he had a dream
And it was a child nursin upon the semen of the glass genetalia
Clouded nut after clouded nut
He woke and shouted ""What the FUCK is goin on?""
Smokey was swayze, it's time to get....

Chorus

[Brewin]
He figured there was only one way
As he rushed the runway lookin wild deranged
This was common, without any qualm inside he was tookin
Lookin at fiends of the pebble adored praised,
Devil for lord raised from the crystallized tombs
Through fumes from the floor
Blazed the sole sacrificial altar
He chose now to halt the worship dealin that ultimate headrush... 

The lead crushed, buyer or seller decoratin hell a flame
With the choir of the firearms to blame
In the mornin by the time the smoke cleared,
Everybody seen the massacre, the local folk cheered
""Oh, thank the Lord Almighty,"" the pharmacy was out of business
On the L a chubby widow cries alone because her man had gotten...

Juggaknots,"I declare war 
The joy becomes a rappifyin' weapon 
If you step in 
When your draws get mobbed behind enemy lines
You become a sittin' duck but fuck 
I ain't givin' 'em livin' trifle 
The pen and pad becomes a 12 gauge rifle 
This is no laughing matter 
Step into this you step in a minefield 
Your body's scattered 
You people drop pickin' up the pieces 
But only corny niggas 
The attack from a brotha like the Buddy never ceases 
Without a moment of silence the violence thickens
So if you ain't got it together you slim pickings 
Shorts and prisoners are never taken 
If you fakin' all the booty competition 
I'm a bag fuck a white flag 
Get down and dirty like a brotha in the trench 
Leave a nigga dead and stinkin' as he wonders what his stench is 
I'm bustin' clip after clip 
My artillery will funk on the punk 
When ya want to test my shit

Tell it to hell is it
I feel my brain swell like meningitis 
With the slightest mind motion 
Givin' me the notion
That I got it bad 
I think I got a brain tumor 
Brain rumor 
Such a pain to analyze the strain and then understand it
The seed was planted
That shit is ill but still 
The thought I'm lovin' got the dome growin' 
With the biscuit in the oven 
Shovin' nothin' but the nutrients 
My diet to support me
A whiff of the spliff 
A guzzle of the forty to inspire fire thought
To the mic there was marriage
Causin' competition 
Verbal miscarriage of the mental fetus 
Greet us with the rugged rhythm then I'm showin'
I think I feel my water breakin' thus I'm flowin'
Timin' my contractions 
Concentratin' on my breathin'
Heavin' curses at the father he has the funk 
'Cause if I flunk my shit ain't livin'
Pushin' givin' every bit of what I'm worth 
And as the Brewin' drops the lyrical 
The miracle of birth

I be the sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga 
A phony motherfucker grave digga 
I know this sounds rough 
But I had enough to funk 
So part of me the heart of me
So if you corny nigga 
It's like cloggin' up my artery 
You cuttin' circulation 
So now it's do or die 
While niggas always try to test my shit
Only preservation of the funk is why I kick this
As I give a simple diagnosis of the sickness

Now upon the fruits of my labor 
Your ear feasts 
The beast from within 
It's some shit ain't it
The picture painted 
From the use of a noun and a verb might disturb 
We make you say, ""Damn that nigga's crazy"" 
Well if we crazed, deranged well then we fittin'

She's my friend, she's my wife
But she lives away from me
She needs to feel that she is free
And even though, it's all I've got
With her I don't need much
To know I've got a lot
She's a dove caught in flight

Without a landing place in sight
But if I know her like I think
She'll find a place before she sinks
She's off alone, on her own
Leaving me to sit beside the telephone
Cast away loose the knot
She's getting sun on the spot
Where her ring used to be

Before feelings were stronger than our promise
Yesterday we walked hand in hand
You were with me, you were my own
You were my girl, you were the lover of my life
She's the girl that I love
She's the one that I think of
I have to hold on to the hope
That I did not miss the boat

So life goes on day by day
All that's left for me is hit my knees and pray
Cast away loose the knot
I'm getting sun on the spot
Where my ring used to be
Now it feels so empty
So I put it back, I had to live
And I hope you can forgive
That I've tried to forget
That my feelings were stronger than a promise

Just settling for exceptions

Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man

And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon
And I'm on that Philly fire shit
Then I come fully equipped

If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada

Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card
You chumps, you best call General Motors
I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
General toaster

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)

I guess it's the glamour that I present
Guys like my appearance and the way I rap
But they're too chicken to say they're on my strap
I know they're in love with the way I perform
Because I bring a sunshiny day from a rainstrorm
They love my voice, they know I'm their choice
My raps and my beat are equal the poise
They never reject anything I say
They receive it and believe it cause I don't play

I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted

Any MC I'll admonish on and off the stage
Spreadin fear across the land like a nuclear reactor
Measurin the radius like a protractor

Down with the Juice since the basic foundation
Blinded to the sight, to the touch I'm scorchin
Rhymes so def that they're worth a fortune
Bullet-proof sneakers, a bullet-proof vest
Killin like a villain from the old wild west
Write one rhyme and for years you run it
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
Come see our show cause it ain't like others
We roast, don't boast and we're close like brothers
You better hold your girl when the Crew walk by her
If one of us is skeezin we just might try her
If you want to step to us there's no half-steppin

Woke up one morning, I became an MC
To protest this matter and always agree

Any MC I'll admonish on and off the stage
Spreadin fear across the land like a nuclear reactor
Measurin the radius like a protractor
MC's label me as the mic manipulator
My brain is the bomb, my mouth is the detonator

With the mic in my hand I mutilate MC's

Juice Crew Allstar is who I be
And S-h-a-n-t-e is the title for me
My gift of gab qualifies for everything that I do
And that's the reason why I'm here just to tell it to you
Why I'm a Juice Crew Allstar, best believe I am the best
Guaranteed to let you know why ShantÃ©, yes, is super fresh
Never find another MC who could cope
Because ya best believe I'm as strong as dope
Knock out all the MC's that is in my way
You cannot qualify cause I am ShantÃ©
Now my rhymes are so def that they call them tragic
Couldn't be part of the Crew without a touch of Magic

[ Craig G ]
I have the greatest reputation for rhymes that I craft
And destroyin all rappers that step in my path
So all you path-steppers, you better stop steppin
Cause I release lyrics as if they were weapons
Rappers start trainin, cause I be remainin
The rhymes that I state will stay in your brain and
You'll keep dancin, I'm self-enhancin
Got more rhymes than there's rooms in a mansion
So to my opponents this won't be pleasant
You were good in '86, but this is '87
It's time to react, put records on wax
My rhymes gain more than visual impact
Ears will respond to what I'm creatin
I'll be infiltratin with the rhymes I'm articulatin
Don't say I'm wack, that's not a fact
I could never get bust by an '86 new jack
Stay in your spot before you get rocked
I'm not goin for it, so rappers just stop
Please heed my message, this is your last warnin
Turn over a new leaf cause a new day is dawnin
So bitin MC's, you know who you are

The party doesn't start until I enter the place
And all ya MC's know me by my face
Now that you know me, why don't you show me
All the respect that you owe me
Everywhere I go I get a compliment
I guess it's the glamour that I present
Guys like my appearance and the way I rap
But they're too chicken to say they're on my strap
I know they're in love with the way I perform
Because I bring a sunshiny day from a rainstrorm
They love my voice, they know I'm their choice
My raps and my beat are equal the poise
They never reject anything I say
They receive it and believe it cause I don't play
When I rock upon the mic I'm bound to go far
And Glamorous is down with the Juice Crew Allstars

Country comfort in a heart that's going back home

The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
Hey but that ain't natural old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Country comfort in a heart that's going back home",Country Comfort,1981
Juice Newton,"Listen to the story 'bout the man who tried
To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry

The river ran dry and it broke his heart

Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side

You know it's sure good to see you again
There's no need to explain where you've been

No, I won't scold you like a runaway child

And if they tell me our love's just too hot to survive
I deny them, I defy them
 
And if true love is unending then this love is true
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you

When it comes to forever, it's never too late
And if this isn't heaven, then heaven can wait

And if love was a candle, I'd shine like the sun
When the sun is an ember, you'll still be the one
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you, it must be you
It must be you, It must be you",It Must Be You,1999
Juice Newton,"He said, ""I've seen you before"", 
As the band broke into Misty.
I put one hand on the bar.
The whole room by then
Was starting to spin.

I said, ""you've got Hemingway's eyes"",
And that night I called him papa.
It seems that there are so many lovers
Who hold you and yet,
Whose name you forget.

[Chorus]
Dance, they said
Life is only for the moment
The light is brief,
Don't waste it.
The taste is sweet so taste it.
So I said I understand,
I'm dancing as fast as I can.

Maybe were just shooting stars
Needing something to hold on to,
But each thing we touch seems to vanish, 
Like candles and friends
They burn at both ends.

[Chorus]

He said I'll see you around,
And as I brushed my hair
I winked and said, ""you might"".
Cause I know by now how it's done,
After all the mornings after
And all the nights.

I’m the guy your girl been texting with
Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit
That’s potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish
In a box Chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship
Legolas and Aragorn cruising through Connecticut
Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks
Throw around bread, I’m on my Hansel and Gretel shit
A psychopath on a path of destruction
Popping Xanax til I’m seeing black
I better pass the Dutch Master I’m puffing
The first up the the mic but the last to the function
Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking
East Coast, we don’t borrow your swagger for nothing
We’d rather start a battle instead of having a discussion
So pass it back to me, cousin
Shit I’m so nice I could spit this shit right here backwards in Russian!

No sound like the one I got
They can hear it anytime I rock
Cause all I got’s my balls and my word
And this baggie full of herb
And I’m coming for that #1 spot

I’ve always been a loose cannon
They say I rolled off of a pirate ship
High as shit, Bobby Costas, look how red my eyes’ll get
I’m out in Sochi, 720 to a flying split
And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh
See I be showing them what I can do with this shit

I’m hitting and missing, and I’m just here trying to vibe
Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me
Now they all love me, or hate me
Like there ain’t no in between
I’m doing me, and that’s all I know
Out on the road doing these shows
To give you the fans a little piece of my soul

And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask

Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back

Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices

Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it

The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrate our [?]

Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it

And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange

And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs
I’m just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works
Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I’ll never hold a curse
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts
Help an older lady across the road, “hey can I hold your purse?”
Then kick her in front of a moving bus, “oh no, she’s hurt!”
Shit I’m pretty sure she’s dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
I’m on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail
I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in
He’s a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen
I don’t need a reason
I’m creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
You won’t see me leaving, I’m running through that
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike’s back on the shoe rack
Huh I’ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out?
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T til it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
It’s weird that I ain’t crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor
Sike, I’m off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker

Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out
Tryna stack absurd amounts with a purdy spouse
Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out

And get fucking intense like Native American sex
Fuck the money, when I started I was there for respect
That’s why I’m still in Connecticut where my chariot rest
I’m on the edge, do y’all dare me to step?
Will y’all just find another rapper to rep and even care if I left?
Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous
Now all of em fucking famous and boy I’m just fucking waiting

The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew

Scrawny little punk, to the Razor Ramon type
Independent and continually making fans
Turned down a lot of deals, and chose to make a stand
Fuck selling out, homie that ain’t the plan
Why push the envelope? I’m tackling the mail man
So here I am as I’m rambling, pants sagging
And ransacking the game, no receipt for the transaction
And they hopping right on to the band wagon
With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and
Attacking these beats thoroughly, in my prime currently
Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me
Sure to be a legend, impressing with every story told
Go balls to the wall like I’m fucking y’all through a glory hole

Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
'Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
'Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that

Just tell them to throw there fist in the sky and start a rebellion!",Stand Up,2014

Juicy Fruits,"We'll remember you forever Eddie
Through the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love

Little Eddie Mitty born in Jersey City
Started singin' when he was five
Never knew his father mother didn't bother
To catch his last name fast as he came

He was off and flying
Times were really trying
Eddie and his mother alone
Soon another mister soon a baby sister
Mama kept swingin' and Eddie kept singin'

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

And now the tragic story
Eddie's sister, Mary Louise, needed an operation
To get the money he would have to become an overnight sensation
Eddie believed the American people
Had wonderful, lovegiving hearts
His well publicized end he considered would send
His memorial album to the top of the charts...and it did

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

When a young singer dies to our shock and surprise
In a plane crash or flashy sports car
He becomes quite well known
And the kindness he's shown has made more than one post mortem star
Well you did it Eddie and though it's hard to applaud suicide
You gave all you could give so your sister could live
All America's choked up inside

We'll remember you forever Eddie
Thru' the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love","Goodbye, Eddie, Goodbye",1974

No fresh clothes 'cause a playa was real poor

Lookin' for y'all cowards 'cause y'all talking out the side of your mouth
Knowin' that the Triple 6 is one of the hardest rappers out
DJ Paul and Juicy J, best producers in the town
I've been got the crown those that ain't down get run down

Man, if one of you bitches wanna step up to the juice
Talking 'bout that nigga wrong talkin' 'bout what cha gonna do
Man, it's on, if you rappers wanna bring it to the door
To you crosses in my click, I'm treat you like a hoe

I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
That's because they record company wouldn't spend dough

Yeah, my label got a hook up with MTV
But they just keep forgettin' to tell 'em 'bout me
They try to play like its love and it's family
But all my marketin' dollars goin' to, shh

Juicy J,"Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though

And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed

Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P

My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally

To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!

Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let’s fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch

Uh, just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
Uh, it don't stop here nigga
Yea, uh

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got's your name and your words will never break
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
'Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it out
Selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate now let's get medicated

Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Rolling weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy begin so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali' bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twistin' marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we on us
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in no hole
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef 'cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
On-doers get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

Bought some shit that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows

She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

I’m sprung and I don’t care

Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscing on wild us and rolling the miles up
So [?] I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, know what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green [?]
Bucketlist complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fucking with me?
I think nada, lame rappers you make me gog up
The part, depart these niggas like I'm shooting commas

Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks depending on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listening to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
We be breaking it all the way down so anybody could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was buffy
Hand-to-hand combats, sometimes I live lovely
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinking you making history
But looking back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then
And ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary

Whole life we grinding for the dough
And leave behind a legacy, the legend of it too
It's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth
If anybody gon' do it know we gon' do
Whole life we grind so hard to stay official
And make them niggas hating back [?] tissue
They shit you 'til they stomach, fuck 'em
I ain't never loved 'em
Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth, the young soldiers in the street
[?] to the money, they reminding me of me
When you get get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
Cause someone gon' be right there then take your spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna be blasted, man, they better stop
For shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late to serve you, they can't get you mopped

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I could sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high and bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone
You don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons

Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sisters daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Whore without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines, 'bout the section lines, I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact

All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

Gettin' money is what I do, thought you knew

Get money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen inshallah

Juicy J,"Be careful, 'cause you can't trust these so called friends out here
They be jealous

What about your friends will they stay on they grind?
What about your friends will they be around?
What about your friends will they let you die?
What about your friends?
With friends like that I don't need enemies

I had a lotta niggas that was down with me
Or should I say a lotta niggas hang around with me?
But when I took my fall
I found out I really didn't have many friends at all
When I was out there rollin' in the Benz and ball
My momma used to get a lotta telephone calls
Niggas tryna see how we was, I had a buzz
But all that shit stopped when I got popped by the fuzz
A couple niggas kept that shit true indeed
But not the ones I used to bail outta jail and feed
We used to smoke weed and get drunk off brew
I went to TDC, nigga, I couldn't find you
You couldn't find me that's what you told yourself
But you couldn't tell that bullshit to nobody else
But when they asked you how I was doin', you told 'em I was cool
Knowin' you ain't talk to me since I went to the pen, fool
No pictures, no commissary, money to eat
And now you think it's all good, 'cause I'm back on the streets
I'm back on these beats and still blowing like the wind
But these is the niggas that we call friends

What about your friends will they stay on they grind?
What about your friends will they be around?
What about your friends will they let you die?
What about your friends?
With friends like that I don't need enemies

In these streets and these traps, nigga you better be strapped
Niggas out here plottin' be prepared to shoot back
Nigga ain't no rules, nigga it ain't no love
A nigga put a knife in your nigga, could be your blood
Kill a nigga over money, kill a nigga over drugs
They killing niggas over hoes be careful who you fuck
One false move and you fucked and out here on that bullshit
Catch a fuck niggas and they hit his ass with the full clip
(What about your friends)
Niggas ain't real
Niggas ain't trill
Niggas be jealous
Over the hoes, over the whips, over the crib
Niggas be broke, pockets be hurt
Nigga be stressed
Nigga be learning
Whoop your friend, you gotta murk 'em
Payback it's closed curtains

What about your friends will they stay on they grind?
What about your friends will they be around?
What about your friends will they let you die?
What about your friends?
With friends like that I don't need enemies

It's so ill, pop no pills
Straight Henn' a toast to Pimp C , now on to fake friends
Tina best friend husband fucking her cousin
Her cousin, she think her baby by Tina husband
But Tina had a miscarriage by me
Ten months later, Tina had a baby, it's deep
Soon the whole hood will be related
Like an African tribe, misplacement situated
13, she's already ripping
So whoever daughter she is, you about to be in grandpa position
And pot, no pot to piss in
Man, stop and listen
Your man from the sand box, he on the stand snitching
His John Hancock, got 'em lamb chops with his misses
Home exonerated 'cause he cooperated
I peep the bullshit coming, the streets taught me
And in abundance, now my circle a hundred

Spitting game switching lane to lane in that new mustang

All we do is roll some joints and smoke until the sun come up
All we do is grind all day and try to get the money up
All we do is hit the club and tell some bitches come with us
Party and get high

Juicy J,"It's KK what I'm smoking nigga

And I done popped so many bottles think I'm through with it
Been smoking so much weed in public own a school with it
Been on my grind since I was young and now I'm stupid rich
You niggas stupid, I'm in the club and it's ruthless
My crew ain't part of that bullshit
My new whips the hardest
Walk in the office like a business man
I'm just an artist
Smoking and all, crib full of weed
Plaques on the wall
My face on all the magazines
Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese
Pants skinny rubber bands plenty
Whole team going hard like it's the last inning
Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning
Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pinning
I play the game left hand like my man Jimmy
You just a right hand man call that man Semi

Real shit a nigga do

All of this off the internet
Those who ain't seen it coming dog I been a threat
Been smoking up all this weed
Been rolling up while I drive
Been to the bottom and back
Been seen you haters disguised
Niggas telling me lies
Just to try to get close
Shades cover my eyes 'cause I be higher than most
Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn’t tired
Live by the code, money power
Once I got on, my niggas hired
Juicy J he ride, it’s the gang or die
The game will stress you out but that’s what this dubie is for
You acting like you know me now
Never knew me before
Snoop sat me down, schooled me to more
Kick it with my son and don’t even do the awards
Said next year I might win me one
You got problems don't lend me none
Got a pound then go send me one

Niggas out here broke because they scared of that bread
My money so old I got mold on that bread
How you think I win and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche?
Turn around and bought a Maybach next week
A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap
Nigga ain’t shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets
Ever since I was a youngin I been
Getting it in the streets
Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas
All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese
I ain't too good for that brown paper bag
I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe

Most of these niggas ain't been in the streets
Can't let a bitch take advantage of me

Two shots of my liquor, she leaving with me
Feeling like two, I may leave here with three
I blew so much money, I feel like Big Meech

In the jungle getting money
Smoking L's by the hundreds
We got blow, we got molly
We got blood on the money, dedicated to the money
Killing niggas for the money, the power and the money
I went from the bando to the island with the money
In the room, bag it up, for four hours with the money
I go bang, bang, bang, bang, for the power and the money
All these zeros in my check, the bank keep piling up my money

They say Young Khalifa, why you sound like that?
Then how the fuck you blow it by the pound like that?
How you young but you still run your town like that?
Got that talk shit, believe it's goin' down like that
Why you keep them G's around like that?
Why you treat them niggas like some clowns like that?
We ain't do it, he got found like that
Fuck around and catch a hundred rounds like that

All of my niggas so violent
I just might buy this whole island
I'm lovin' the view but it's time to bust moves, so I might just hop in the Coupe
Watch what you say to me, watch what you do to me 'cause my young nigga might shoot
Bitch, you know I got the juice, why you think they call me Juice
Five hundred dollar shots, you might wanna mix it with juice
In the Rolls or the Benz, bankroll full of bands
Fuck some girls and her friends, tryna do this shit again
Yeah it's blood on the money, we got love for the money
But I ain't got nothing but slugs for a nigga tryna take something from me

Yeah, since they're sleepin' on me, let me wake 'em up
Got the world in my palm, watch me shake it up
Everything I'm talkin' real, I ain't make it up
I know you probably think I care, but I don't give a fuck
But I ain't givin' up, I'd rather live it up
Everybody sound the same, you need to switch it up
They still swervin' in my lane, they need to give it up

And shake and then fall and break with that bottom bass
Make you wanna tear the club up and go tattoo your face
Country boys, gutter raised, what a blend, that's all it takes
Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock
With a cop I'm a nervous wreck
I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take
And I leave you with nothing left, but mama tried
Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died
If she ever said I was a good boy
Trust me, mama lied
Leave these haters with a cane to walk
Take these lames with a grain of salt
All I wanna do is take aim, assault
Tell my story, paint the wall 
From Alabama to Atlanta from Atlanta 
I began to build a plan, a panoramic view
To center who my friends, the men around me was the culture is that slum, uh
And I'm not alone
I put a flag in Nashville, and I'm feelin' right at home

Damn right, so give me that bag of money real quick let's go

Jukebox the Ghost,"There's a dead man hanging, slumped over the steering wheel of an interstate
Runaway bursting into flames
And the devil was gently breathing, sleeping face-down in my
Apartment, and like all his friends I'm growing tired of his games...

And there's a homeless man arranging his hands, grooving to the beat
Radiating from a police scanner, who said ""The air was feeling good to
Me, just as cool and ripe as air can be,"" and a woman who sincerely
Believes in UFOs and who can blame her when the stars are hanging
Overhead, dangling by a thread, floating ten thousand feet off the ground...

(This was a story told to me when I was just the age of 17, one which
God himself dictated to me, he said, ""This is how all this shits gonna
Be when I blow your little planet into smithereens."" It haunted my
Dreams like an accident on reply on a TV screen.)

She sees faces in her dreams--strange machines she'd never seen
Blueprints of submarines to reassemble in a time of dire need
And there were preachers in the desert, waving to the crowd
Dictating seven angry letters from a man up in the clouds

And there were 27 soldiers telling 27 lies
And a hole inside a hurricane with a pair of beady eyes
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

There were strangers in the subway and men in limousines making deals and
Swapping photographs of cans of gasoline, and there are no angels in the woodwork
Or devils on the ground, and they are looking through a hurricane's tectonic wall of
Sound and a man who smokes his cigarettes the other way around and she is looking
In behind him from inside a wall of sound and she is dancing with the neon because
The air is feeling good against her arms and legs and fingertips are measuring the
Distance in the spaces in between me and you and all your friends when there's no
Time to load a weapon and no time to make amends and people frozen in their tracks
Staring at the sky at a hole inside a hurricane revealing...

A pair of beady eyes!
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

This is not a test, this is the real thing...

End of the hall, it's just the stars stooping down to sing their goodbyes while a

Safely in your arms
All at once it came to me
Love´s never to be as seems
You and all this time
And how could I see it too
The dream of love was just for fools
But still I fell for you
I could leave when I might try
I could run away
But something inside drives me home
I´m a hungry slave enslaved

Strange how the wind blows
And love you´ll never know
When did it come to you and me

Perhaps this dreaming is real

Throw up my hands, enjoy the ride

Jula De Palma,"Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment we kissed the night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm while takin' a sleigh ride

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call that tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve to send you some flowers

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

(The way that we cheered whenever our team was scoring a touchdown)
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down

The Halloween hop when everyone came in funny disguises

Well I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you

Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved

Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you

Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye

Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose,
You are still on the square,
I'll be gloomy
But send the rainbow to me
Then my shadows will fly,

Jule Styne,"The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy 
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

 The moonlight on the lake

 The bell I (you) rang to prove that I was

 The rented tandem bike
 The lunches that we used to pack

Do you remember our picnic lunch?
We both went up to the lake
And then we walked among the pines
The birds sang out a song for us
We had a fire when we came back
And your smile was beautiful
You touched my cheek and you kissed me
At night we went for a stroll
The wind blew our hair
The fire made us warm
The wind blew the waves
Out on the lake
We heard the owl in a nearby tree.

Flow like they did when I saw

As bells sounded
In the night.

On the water
It was only a reflection
Dying with the swan.

When you walked into the room
I found I couldn't even move
There was magic in your eyes
(I tried to hide, then I knew)
You could see inside my mind

There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

When you touched my hand I knew 
That I had helplessly fallen for you
You had cast a spell on me
(I was blinded, but)
You were all that I could see

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

Now the moon is full tonight
So maybe this is why I've lost my mind
But the spell you cast on me
Has made me feel so free
I think we're gonna fly away, up to the stars
And I don't even know who you are
Maybe it's just and old superstition, but,
You're a warlock aren't you?

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight

We could be shoveling tons of coal, down in the boiler room.

Take a sugar-cured ham, a candied yam, 
Or take your favorite Uncle Sam, 
And shout a big hooray, it's strictly USA. 
You never can know a country 
Till you know the folks, see them 
In their own native locales. 
If you wanna see young acorns 
Growing into oaks, you gotta 
See the fellas and gals. 
And inspecting extra special, 
A bunch of merchandise, 
The all-American Cow wins the prize. 
Your All-American man is nice young man, 
He is a handy man in a pinch, 
Maybe he can't make love 
Like a clam who can, 
Till he gets his gal in a clinch. 
All-American Man may not get what he wants, 
For the All-American Girl wears the pants. 
Like the flag on the little red schoolhouse 
Like the ball on election day, 
Like a brass spittoon, and Daniel Boone, 
It's strictly USA. 
That is to say Bud! Down South it's hi-all, 
Cowboys say Howdy, Indians say How 
No matter where you're meeting folks. 
It's the real American way of greeting folks. 
Bring your gal to the rodeo in Reno 
Or to the beach in Chesapeake Bay 
Like the ice cream cones, or Casey Jones, 
Like Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones 
They're really here to stay, but strictly USA.",Strictly U.S.A.,2002

I want to be a part of it, New York, New York

Right through the very heart of it, New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

Jules Pacy-Cole,"

I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

But I´m steady

So hard to change
The more they stay the same

Jules Shear,"Down in Piedras Negras you gotta watch yourself
There's a whole lotta hungry people lookin to share some wealth
And when the oilfield's busted and the peso takes a dive
Stay off the side streets if you wanna come back alive 
Yo no busca nada I'm just standin here
Mindin my own business, gonna get back outta here

Back to the safe side
Back to the safe side

And at the base of the barstool there's a drain in the floor
You better not go in there, if you don't know what that's for
It's no place to take your lady, she'll get the evil eye
Sizin up their prospects, sharpin up their knives

No me gusta nada, yo no queiro ver
Once I get across this river, never gonna go back there

Stayin on the safe side
Stayin on the safe side

Yo no fuma mota yo no quiero ver
Once I getacross this river, never gonna go back there

Up in San Antonio all the pretty people know
They better stay off of the west side where the black tar flows
They hide in their sheltered enclaves up around Olmos Park
They got their own policeman so they can stay out way past dark

Back down in Piedras Negras, the children play with dirt
We keep our pistols loaded so we don't get hurt
No importa a nadie, it's always been that way
Never gonna get no different, long as we got our say

Stay on the safe side
Stay on the safe side

No me gusta nada, it's always been that way
Never gonna get no different long as we got our way

Is' mir egal

Ich trau der Ruhe eines Toten
Ich traue niemand' der mich liebt
Doch mich zu hassen bleibt verboten
Und es bleibt ein echtes Wunder wenn es dich noch gibt

Wenn du lachst
Is' mir egal
Wenn du lachst
Dann is' mir egal
Wenn du lachst
Is' mir egal
Was noch kommt
Dann ist alles andre

Wenn du lachst
Dann is mir alles andre
Wenn du lachst
Dan ist mir alles andre
Wenn du lachst
Dann ist mir alles andre
Scheißegal was kommt
so egal",Wenn du Lachst,2004
Juli,"Ein neuer Tag beginnt
Es fängt von vorne an
Ich lasse es hinter mir
Lass los, was ich nicht ändern kann

Ein neuer Tag beginnt
Ein Tag wie frischer Schnee
Ich hab noch nichts kaputt gemacht 
Ich geh'

Ich werde sein wie Glas
Sein wie Teflon
Alles wird
Der Himmel wird schon hell, hell, hell
Ich stehe ganz allein
Ich gehe über neu gestellte Weichen
Über Zäune
Über Leichen
Über Los, los, los
Ich gehe ganz allein

Ein neuer Tag
Ein neuer Plan
Ein neues Ziel
Lalala
Ich fang' an!
Ein neuer Start
Ein neuer Plan
Ein neues Spiel
Lalala
Wir fangen ganz von vorne an
Wir fangen ganz von vorne an

Ein neuer Lauf beginnt
Wohin ist mir nicht klar
Die Zeichen stehen auf Sturm
Und die Ferne ist zum greifen nah
Der letzte Atemzug
Ist viel zu lange her
Und was mich unten hält
Will ich nicht mehr

Ich werde sein wie Glas
Sein wie Teflon
Alles wird
Der Himmel wird schon hell, hell, hell
Ich stehe ganz allein
Ich gehe über neu gestellte Weichen
Über Zäune
Über Leichen
Über Los, los, los
Ich gehe ganz allein

Ein neuer Tag
Ein neuer Plan
Ein neues Ziel
Lalala
Ich fang' an!
Ein neuer Start
Ein neuer Plan
Ein neues Spiel
Lalala
Wir fangen ganz von vorne an
Wir fangen ganz von vorne an
Wir fangen ganz von vorne an
Ein brandneuer Tag
Ganz von vorne an
Ein brandneuer Tag
Ganz von vorne an

Juli,"We watched the season pull up its own stage
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away

You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

Invitation only grant farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnight

You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

And from the ballroom floor we are a celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we are; we'll sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well

You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart

I watch you spin around in the highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
We all look like we feel

You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart",Stolen [Multimedia Track],2007
Juli,"Atemlos und ferngesteuert
Abgestumpft und sorgenschwer
Ich bin völlig weggetreten
Ich spür mich selbst nicht mehr
Ich will aus 15 Metern,
Ins kalte Wasser springen
Damit ich wieder merk'
Das ich am leben bin
Ich geh nach vorne, bis zum Rand
Ich spür mein Herz pulsiert
Ich atme ein und lass mich fallen
Ich spüre jeden Teil von mir

Elektrisches Gefühl
Ich bin völlig schwerelos
Elektrisches Gefühl
Wie beim ersten Atemzug
Elektrisches Gefühl
Und die Stimme dir mir sagt
Heute wird ein guter Tag
heute wird ein guter Tag

Auch wenn mich 1000 Sorgen quälen
Und sie mich nach unten ziehen
Es ist besser loszulassen
Als dran kaputt zu gehen
Ich nehme was mir Angst macht
Und schreib es auf Papier
Ich zünd es an und lass es brennen
Ich lass es hinter mir
Alles um mich herum pulsiert
Ich spür den Schmerz nicht mehr
Der Boden die Wand, der Raum vibriert
Ich bin wieder unbeschwert

Elektrisches Gefühl
Ich bin völlig schwerelos
Elektrisches Gefühl
Wie beim ersten Atemzug
Elektrisches Gefühl
Und die Stimme dir mir sagt
Heute wird ein guter Tag
heute wird ein guter Tag

Wohoo oh
Wooh wooh
Wohoo oh
Wooh wooh
Wohoo oh
Yeah yeah
Wohoo oh
Wohoo oh

Alles was dich runter zieht
Alles was dein Herz lahm legt
Lass es los
Lass es los
Lass es los
Alles was nicht wichtig ist
Alles was nicht richtig ist
Lass es los
Lass es los
Lass es los

Elektrisches Gefühl
Ich bin völlig schwerelos
Elektrisches Gefühl
So wie beim ersten Atemzug
Elektrisches Gefühl
Und die Stimme dir mir sagt
Heute wird ein guter Tag
heute wird ein guter Tag",Elektrisches Gefühl,2010
Juli,"Die Stadt ist leer, die Häuser sind Waisen. 
Unbewohnt - Die Menschen auf Reisen.
Der Wind streift durch die Straßen und fegt die Gassen.
Und die Wachposten haben Wache und Posten verlassen.
Und die Wörter mit denen sie Autos verkaufen.
Wie Liebe, Herz und Glück, die holen wir uns zurück.
Denn selbst Gott ist im Urlaub 
und wir fahren Rollschuh auf der Autobahn. Denn

Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.

Die Bank ist leer, das Erbe verbrannt
Keine Sicherheit mehr, kein Geld, keine Angst.
An diesem Ort, an den alle ziehen
Fall ich rückwärts den Himmel hinauf.
Die Welt ist von oben so schön.

Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love.
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.

Eine gestohlene Stunde. Noch nicht schlafen, noch nicht wach.
Bäcker und Blumenverkäufer und ich sind Komplizen in der Nacht.
Und auf den Straßenlampen sitzen Vögel
Und sie rufen: eine Stunde eine blaue Stunde.
Bist du nicht mehr Teil der Zeit.",Ich Bin in Love (Paris),2010

She worries me so, mother-in-law,mother-in-law
If she leaves us alone, we would have a happy home
Sent down from below
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law

Sin should be her name, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
To me, they're about the same, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
Every time I open my mouth, she steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low?
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law

I come home with my pay, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She asks me what I make, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She thinks her advice is a contribution
But if she will leave that will be a solution
And don't come back no more

Julia,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow,1999

Na hora de amar reclama do colchão

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2001

Oh, can you help me?
They're caging in my soul
Overloading angels
Can you bless me?
Oh, can you save me?

I'm turning into them
And I don't know why, 
I feel straight when I'm high
It's not my dream to fly, 
In anybody's sky

You left me, 
You left me, 
In the dark

Can you feel me?
Oh, can you touch me?
I'm here behind my smile

You left me in the dark
Overloading God, can you hear me?
