Fraternity of Man,"Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me
Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me

Roll another one
Just like the other one
You've been hanging on to it
And I sure would like a hit

Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me
Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me

Roll another one
Just like the other one
That one's just about burnt to the end
So come on and be a real friend

Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me
Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me

Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me
Don't bogart that joint, my friend
Pass it over to me

Fratta,"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and
twist of fate
On a bed of nails
she makes me wait
And I wait... without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm,
we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you...
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied,
my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you",Angelitos Negros,

Meine Heimat ist Berlin, eine Welt für sich
Denn sie blendet jede andre Stadt in grelles Licht
Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin
Deutsche wollen in diese Stadt, doch haben's nicht verdient

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall
Hier ist Silvester schon am ersten Mai
Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug
Die Lichter brennen wenn das Nachtleben losbricht lichterloh
Groupies werden hier bedroht
Ich wünsch' mir die Mauer zurück
Wenn du nicht raust kommst, wir laufen ein Stück
Jeden Tag gibt es neue Probleme (Doch keine Lösung)
Willkommen in meiner Gegend

Willkommen in Berlin, in der Stadt der Probleme
Das hier ist Berlin, diese Stadt in der ich lebe
Man steht in Berlin, Sport man die Macht der Straße
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz, wir sind einzigartig

Willkommen in Berlin, wir haben die größte Schnauze
Das hier ist Berlin, das hier ist mein Zuhause
Weil ich lieb Berlin und hasse dein beschissenes Kaff
Aus der Gosse in die Charts wir sind die Kinder der Nacht

Willkommen in meiner Stadt wo die Nacht zum Tag wird
Wo die Spack die grad' turnt nachts im Park stirbt
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht mach dich rar, Knirps
Blas' die Bars mit einer dieser Hits, die im Lauf liegt
Spits bis sie auffliegt, spit bis mein Licht in den Rauch zieht
Spit ich vernichte dich auch, Freak!
Du bist es nicht gewohnt, hockst den ganzen Tag im Dorf rum
Wo wir herkommen ist Hass oft an der Tagesordnung
Pack' die Rapsticks um ich mach Business
Hinter verschlossenen Türen wie Kabinettssitzung
Wie die Mücken auf der Bank in Bronx
Oder bar auf die Hand, oder ganz in Fonds.
Für den Rolls Royce und das Stückchen Land in France
Deine starken Strahlen strahlen wie Lampions
Und du boxt dich von unten durch
Auch wenn der Shit den du bringst nicht stimmt bist du unten durch

Die Stadt ist wie ein Dschungel, diese Narren in Berlin
Jeder hat hier seine Wumme, Megaloh made in Berlin
Wir ballern euch um, das ist die Realität
Von früh bis spät, wie ich mein Leben gelebt
Man die Stadt ist wie ein Dschungel

Scheiß auf Politik
Aggro Ansage Fünf

Nutte komm' klar
Ich ficke dein' Arsch
Keiner fickt mit den Aggro-Stars
Du bist am Start, wir sind am Ziel
Das Business ist ein Kinderspiel
Wir bleiben die Spitze
Wir schreiben Geschichte (yeah)
Auch, wenn du was dagegen hast
Die Krone ist das Sägeblatt
Jeden Tag hör' ich wie Leute die Mucke pumpen (pumpen)
Du machst mich krasser als ich bin und verdoppelst die Kunden
Wir haben schon Gold, dank dir folgt danach Platin
Ich rede über mein' harten Schwanz
Denn ich weiß du magst ihn
Ihr wollt mich wegsperr'n
Nie wieder meine Raps hör'n
Vergiss es, verpiss dich
Ich sage fick dich, also fick dich
Rede, doch du willst mein Geschäft töten, doch ich lebe noch
Mit jedem Track, den ich mach', ficke ich dich in jedes Loch

Ich bin immer noch ich, ich bin immer noch der Selbe
Jetzt will jeder rappen
Guck jeder gründet ein Label
Ihr seid nicht wie wir
Guck wir sind im Visir
Von den Bullen und dem Staat, der uns kontrolliert
Du bist ein Angsthase, du bist 'ne Blamage das war's
Das ist die Ansage, endlich ist was hartes am Start
Du bist cool! Oh, guck ich hab' dich gerade verarscht
Man sieht eher 'n Mann auf dem Mars
Als dein' Arsch in den Charts
Ich lass nichts erspart, ich scheiß' auf den Fokus und Spiegel
Und auf die taz, weil ich mehr als diese Homos verdiene
Ich red' nicht weiter über mich
Man sieht sich zweimal im Leben
Wenn du nicht aufpasst, sieht man deine Leiche im Regen

Nutte, mach' mir Platz, ich bin hart wie ein Stein
Ich pack' dich am Zopf
Und fick' deinen Kopf
Komm' mal klar! Komm' Mal klar!
Mein Schwanz ist Anabolika
Verbiete meinen Rap und du pushst mein Geschäft, ja
Ich bin Untergrundkönig
Baby, verwöhn' mich
Ein Schwanz in deinem Arsch du fickst mit Frauenarzt
Meine Existenz, mein Weg, mein Team
Berlin Crime Entertainment und Aggro Berlin
Du kommst in meine Welt
Willkomm'n in meiner Welt
Meine Fans unterstützen mich mit ihrem Geld
(Aar, arr) Was ist los mit deinem Mann
Was kann ich dafür, dass er dich nicht richtig ficken kann, Nutte

(Ah) Und es geht los
(Ah) Hol' die Pitbull
(Ah) Keiner hält sein Maul bei uns, Fotze
Du wirst gefickt wie ein guter Dick
Scheiß auf Politik

Scheiß auf Politik
Aggro Ansage Fünf

Mit den härtesten Liedern
In die erste Liga
Unvorstellber, doch es passiert grad'
Wir kassieren Optik
Wie ein Arschfick
Ist es für euch, weil ihr nix abkriegt
Wir denken mit dem Penis, du mit dem Arsch
Bei uns wird alles gesagt
Du nimmst alles mit in's Grab
Ich muss hart sein, keine Gnade
Wie 'ne Granate
Hochgeh'n
Du musst es so seh'n
Es kommt gut an, Rap mit Blutbad
Frag jede Frau dicke Schwänze fühl'n sich gut an
Meiner ist ein Mutant
Du siehst ihn und tust dann
Was ich will
Was ich will?
Ich lass' duch killen

Jetzt ist meine Zeit
Bitches machen die Beine breit
Es geht gar nicht, dass du auf meiner Party alleine bleibst
Ich steh' auf Bräute mit 'nem Hang zur Arroganz
Auch wenn sie tanzt, sie will nur meinen Schwanz
Die ganze Nacht ficken wie ein Tier, tja so ist das
(Ah) Pussys essen meinen Schwanz auf wie Whiskas
Und ihr wisst das
Doch wollt's nicht einseh'n
Ich kann machen was ich will, denn das ist mein Leben
Verbiete mich so viel du willst, doch ich mach' weiter
Wenn du mich störst, schieb' ich dich einfach zur Seite
Auch wenn, meine Art zu ficken für dich billig ist
Mach dir keinen Kopf um die Braut, genauso will sie es

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

I know this nigga and he always be talking that bullshit
But little do he know he gon suffer a wig split
Like fucking with the realest the illest will fucking kill him
A straight up headbuster and also a real nigga
There's gon be consequences so niggas just run in here
I'm unloading the tone and popping an extra clip
A bitch nigga talking is something I can't stand
Or every last will pick up the mess that's gonna land
The I.V.'s in his arm the bullets up in his chest
His shop about to close he shoulda had on a vest
Don't fuck with me nigga that's something I have to stress
Keep talking shit boy your gonna end up with one less
I'm out the Bay nigga that's something you gonna respect
And stay out of my business before you feel the Tech
Don't give a shit bout you I treat you like my hoe
Gon wake up one night and I'm kicking up in your door hoe

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

Got you ducking muthafucker, turn that smile to a frown
I will pop em, drop em, bullets launching, resting all up in your chest
I'm guessing letting bullets wet ya
Shoulda been drenched down in vest hoe that's fasho
I'm most definitely bringing pain to you niggas
like some bitches when I step up in this thang
All you niggas do is gossip like some lil' hoes
You might as well go down to the Shake Junt and slide down poles
Now you running while I'm gunning
Stomping hoping to get close to some shelter
Better catch up with some polices, hope that they can help ya
Help to ? you just better get some younger quick and fast
I'm holding the match and your body's drenching down with gas
Got the tone to ya head yo life flashing right front your eyes
Blow yo ass off ??????????
Me and Project Pat toting gats we do this for sport
Have you made lights, camera, action on the news report

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

Now fuck this goddamn talking
Make you bitches bring the pain
Catch yo hoe ass walking stick a tone to ya brain
You insane if ya think I'ma still let ya breathe
I got Anna on my chest with some tricks up my sleeve
I'ma blast on ya hoe give a damn who was looking
Blow the top off your skull then your life has been tooken
You was cooking up a scheme tryna put me in the beam
But the jokes on you jack slapped his ass with the gat
Beat 'em down to the pavement squealing like a pig
My nigga I don't save 'em beat em like a bitch
Ain't nobody tryna help ya, what they finna do
Hollow lead's gonna melt up, you and your crew
Superman stick your chest out
And watch this 38 slug blow your back out
Bout to bust on you boys shoot you till you dead

Bitch, I got money, I got clothes, 
I got whips, I got hoes
Bitch, I got money, I got clothes, 
I got whips, I got hoes

Im riding tall on 24's, spittin' game right to the hoes
My windows tinted black, make you think you saw a ghost
My hoe painted whit on white, inside leather white on white
Cheefin' drinkin' up all night, ballin' now thats life
Ladies wanna roll with me, roll a bag of dro with me
Party till the crack of dawn, when I'm down in your city
I'm all about this pimpin' when it comes to women
Get some head while tryin' to mac, oh what a feelin'

[Chorus]

Here I am so fresh so so clean
Off in the club, now shut up I said I blew the hoes brain
Before I came, I said I blew the whole thing
Clean off the dollar off in my black on black Impala
The Don Dotta is what they call me over seas
But over here I say I'm the king of Memphis Tennessee
Wrap its a wrap, haters wrapped off up in my duct tape
What it takes, I been hard since my first mixtape
Fakes get your cheese up, way, way, way, up
To my level high in the clouds where my Daddy rests in heaven
But on another note so squad, so I changed the name
I surpass clean like a baby, I'm clean clean

Sellin' pills, 
Sellin' crystal meth, 
Sellin' weed, 
Sellin' speed,

I got a brand whip I put some low pro's on 
So I can hit the club strip get some chose on

Wanna be us ass niggaz out there
Stealin' motherfucker, take ya fake asses on nigga keep it real nigga
Make this money like we makin' it nigga, throw it down

Hypnotized here just to get that grip
Y'all niggaz talk 'cause ya talk like a bitch
Y'all niggaz walk 'cause ya walk like a bitch

Now ain't that some shit ya hatin' on this click
You gon' make a nigga get up with cha kid
Split yo wig oh yes, I did
I told you, you don't want it with a hard hitta kid

I done warned the glock spot to spot hit the locks
Hit a nigga for his stash spot
Took the rock nigga was got that was the plot
Dodge the cops they labeled it another closing shop

Open it up for closin' it up I don't give a fuck
On a daily basis I be postin' it up
Smokin' it up choppin' it to match it wit dub
Give us a club six mane tearin' it up

These niggaz misleaded I'mma throw the first blow
Leave a nigga shirt soaked playin' getcha merked hoe
Chop it yeah, I hope folk money what I work fo'
Paul and Juicy sent me gotta put you in the dirt bro

Comin' with the pistols is easy we can get you guys
Frayser boy bizzle or beezy it's the hypnotize
HCP them my folks weed got my eyes low
If you know what I know run that shit to my doe

We back motherfucker we smack motherfuckers
If you step in our way killaz attack motherfucker
But ya'll know ya'll done heard all that befo'
Y'all done seen the fo-fos and folks kick in ya doe

You done seen the gauge pump bout to see a Chevy trunk
Lights out next to the Mississippi river plumped
Duck tape hog tied wrong place wrong time
Hypnotized minds trick knocked ya up off ya grind

All my muhfuckers you niggaz should already know
I'm the truth and out the booth never been a hoe
Get yo ass flipped sideways cut ya through the doe
You ain't know I'm a young rich gangsta nigga

Never been one of them old type wanksta niggaz
I'm a smart muhfucka ask my mama who made me
A lotta niggaz mad 'cause they know they can't fade me
I'm Chrome Carleone Paul and Juicy who pay me

Well it's ya boy grandaddy call me Mr. Man
Fuckin' ya aunties ya nieces and ya mammies
See I could give a fuck about ya tossin' all ya tough talkin'
You don't like me nigga hit me in my mouth

Man don't talk about it be about it get cha point across then
Candy ass nigga boy you softer than cotton
Fight me or squash it 'cause I ain't 'bout the spit boxin'
Hootin and hollerin' like a cheerleader squadron

You can't be like me slangin' D 'cause I'm hurtin' ya
No competition with the juice 'cause it's curtains
It ain't nothin' shakin' but some pimps in this bizitch
That's why you muggin' and yo face lookin' pizzissed

Stay flippin' cars ballin' out like to shizine
You stay askin' questions how the hell them niggaz do that
We smoke the best of dro while she down with some jack-jack
My eyes like the red carpet still on the blue side

They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went platinium
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at 'em
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggaz rob, kill, murder steal for that ghetty green

U.S. marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like, ""I ain't did shit why you hatin' this?""
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

I been doin' this too long to still be strugglin' livin' like this
Fuckin' off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin' free shows

Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
That's because they record company wouldn't spend dough

Yeah, my label got a hook up with MTV
But they just keep forgettin' to tell 'em 'bout me
They try to play like its love and it's family
But all my marketin' dollars goin' to, shh

Tear da club up was the first crunk fight song
I made that in 92 a lil' not long
That it took 10 million sold and we still ain't on
That's why three 6 is the most known unknowns

Why you fakin' a deal, it don't cost nothin' to be real

All ya gotta do is keep that shit real
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' you got deals
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' that you'll kill

The infrared be beamin', I got this scope-a behind your door
You niggaz can't take it you hate the fact that we runnin' it
You ain't gotta love it but you gon learn to respect it bitch

Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south
Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up
It's a hold up, everybody fold up
Niggaz talk like they tough but they ain't got no nutts, bitch

I'm shootin' a dike in her breasto, coward in his chesto
And this police nigga, what we call em' Donnie Brasco
If you bitches want war, you can bring it, let's go
When I put this tone in yo face presto

Leave you in da street wit a bloody Willie Esco
Drankin' on some scotch and we choppin' down that coco

Don't you make the wrong move and you'll get your ass killed dawg
A fake ass nigga but he claimin' that he real dawg
You ain't gotta lie to kick it actin' like you down dawg
Always lookin' lite trying to wear a murder frown dawg

Don't you get smacked and be gettin' off the pavement dawg
Don't you make me act a fool when somebody hatin' me dawg

Frayzie Bone,"-Layzie Bone-Intro-
I love music (What kind of music?)

-Layzie Bone-Chorus-
We love the Reggae and Jazz, the Rock n Roll could be cool, Alternative too/ We love the Rhythm and Blues/ But I'm a Hip-Hop Baby, from the heart, I never flip flop baby

-Layzie Bone-
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be? (Where would I be?)/ Prolly standin on the hot block, sellin crack rock, runnin them streets, runnin them streets/ I say ""My music is my best friend, my confidant""/ I love the way we live us one together we the perfect bond/ Me and my radio, doin 90 on the freeway, knowin the way to go/ And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin, don't it? And I love to give it to y'all, because I know you want it/ And if you feel like I feel, you love the Rhythm and Blues, Reggae and Jazz the Rock n Roll could be cool/ But, I'ma Hip-Hop baby, this from the heart, I never flip-flop baby/ Give me a drank and a song and I be stress free kickin it, all night long

-Krayzie Bone-
It ain't nothin like Hip-Hop music/ Careful how you use it and please don't abuse it, when you do it/ Music can keep you party people dancin and put your mind in a trancin, keep ya happy, give it a chance come on/ Just flow with the music, get blowed off the music/ When I was 13, like Dr. King ya had dream' to be one of the greatest musicians alive/ To be remembered, when I die/ I love, I love, music...it's got me stayin alive/ And if you took my mic right now, one thing you'll never do is take my love away/ Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

Tossin and turnin, I'm burnin with different melodies, words my niggas tellin me sellin it to the world/ Been rappin, since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Slick Rick, always been a singer mayne/ Late night foster home, workin on perfection my selection of the songs that I heard was my direction/ It's when Tommie was my girlfriend, rolled or go back/ Said ""I'm the baddest mama jamma"", half white and black/ Have my babies: D'Jodecy, sick with Serena, little breed born Bryon, Miss Moe, and Shanika/ Little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus Aaliyah, and the newest one is Shelby/ I can't wait till I see em (Dada), they are the music in my physical form since they was born, I've been singin wit tears in my eyes as I perform, for the whole world/ Until I die like Confuscious, tell the world my name is Bryan, I'm in love with my music/ (Yea, uh) Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop

-Layzie Bone-
Now everybody got that jam, that make ya get up, want to boogy to the beat now/ And if it wasn't for the drums and the strings and the lyrics that we sing what would life really mean now?/ Would it be just as fun? Would ya, kick it the same? Could ya, live without it? Could ya still maintain? My thang, is crank up the volume because it help me escape from my problems/ Till I solve em', and I'ma solve em'/ It's all music, Bone Thugs music

Frazey Ford,"You better get up for your mama
You better grab the best of your life
I know you're ready
To get older
Anyhow
Well all you have to do is wander
Over fields of dark time
Where do you find yourself
Feeling lonesome
Do you reckon your body & your mind ?
Day on earth by the streets at night
Oh yeah
I saw you passing
There in the street lights
Do you have
A home for the morning
And are you holding
Holding on so tight
You say that's what you have been given
A whole lot of nothing for your time
And have you sunken
Down in your bones
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are you holding, holding on so tight
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are holding, holding on so tight",September Fields,2014

Frazzle,"There's a monster name of Frazzle
Who's a good friend of mine
He looks ferocious, but he's really fine
Go up and ask him for his autograph
He'd be so happy that he'd start to laugh

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had

Now you know my buddy Frazzle
He's got fangs on his jaws
His fur is orange, and he's got these claws
He looks so mean that he could scare a crowd
But if you tickle him he laughs out loud

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had

Mr. Frazzle has emotions like the rest of us do
Sometimes he feels low down and ugly, too
And then the tears begin to fill his eyes
It's so pathetic when a monster cries

He goes Argh! That's how he cries
He goes Argh! That means he's sad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The lowest time that he ever had

Argh! That means he's hungry
Argh! That means he's hot
Argh! That means he's sleepy
Argh! That means he's not
Argh! That means yes
Argh! That means no
Argh! Means thank you for the dinner
But, it's getting very late and I really must go

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.

Wash me in the water
He sings to me, to the fallen (water)
And I hear him singing out

I'm nervous in my skin I feel it has been read (rent)

Only the devil could have sent

Prayin' for water to take my breath

Wash me in the water

And I hear him singing out (say do it now)

My muscles have grown weary dragging this cloak of frogs
(Now mosses have grown where he dragged in his cloak of frogs)
And I cried when the deal was struck
Oh please no gun
For I am a murderer hidden in a gasoline shroud
You were my healer you were my match

And it's a doggone shame

Where I'm slowly keeping score

Would drive it home on a spinning wheel

Knittin' her sweaters with their pointy little tails

Tried to get smart back when he was alive

Like she did on that date tacked to the back of her door
The date she gave her word it wouldn't happen anymore


Dream your sweet dreams, little bird, before your demons
Take your wings and you fall to earth
Or is it too late have they found you or were you never alone
Now she knows there's no keeping the poison buried so deep in the ground
For it will always seek the well where the water is drawn

Where the last one crying burns the last before the fire
And the children of the dying hold a matchbook to the pyre
A river of tears drown the last ember's glow
When the cold winds blow and the leaves begin to fall

Where the beauty of the season turns to gray and ashen white
In shattered rooms lit only by the moon and stars at night
Shine down from above on the sorrow below
No reason to stay and nowhere to go
When the cold winds blow and the leaves begin to fall


Turned down turned away and lost
Into the fire your fortunes have been tossed
As we rock all our babies to sleep
And sing of sweet dreams
Sing on the ocean wide and deep
So close your eyes my little darling
You're in my arms 
The world won't turn
The ice won't freeze
And the hunger won't burn

Wit the real deal street life","Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimas and Benz",1995
Freaky Tah,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With  mans on linden and devane we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing glocks on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my reeboks
Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yeahyo
Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like norman bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gats
Carry across town because we tapping niggas hoodrats
But they don't want the fam
See a south side jamaica queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped
Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing levis and pro-keds
Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some powder head
(Freaky TAH) hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..
I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark
I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends
That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain
I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.
Fools make your moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes
Stepping to the CHEEKS you made an error
You been to the “house of pain” now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my tim chukkas
Who who you stepping to the lost boy crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a wanna I do what I gotta
Survive I might not be around in 95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We racking grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons
A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and big tig in Atlanta and Va.....

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street

Freaky Tah,"Here's a tune about this honey named Renee
That I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peepin' shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name
She said my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say
So may I walk you to your subway
She said if you want
So yo, we started talking
I brought two franks and two drinks
And we began walking
I had to see where that head was at
Because the gear was mad phat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for 
She wants to be a lawyer
In other words shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token
She drops a package of the EZ Rider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rock
I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly Blunts
She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts
I said, nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on I can get to show ya

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

Now we sittin' on train
Besides the fingernails
Now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket,with some jeans 
And a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog so we hit the store
Went to the crib
And turned the lights on
A crazy magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch
Stero system with crazy cd's
Understand kid
She got cheese
She said cheeks do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said alright well I'm gonna roll this blunt
She came back with strech pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, Fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chattin
We're smoking blunts on her balcony
We're stearing at Manhattan
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on her breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate
And a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted Bo to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever shorty rock
We can swing it like that
Cause on the real this is where it's at.

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow 
And this what the letter said
It said cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep
So I didn't want to bother you
I left a number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed
Smoked a blunt
Then I bounced to the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you
She's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty
Crack a 40 with my naughty freaks
A man, I never been in love
But everytime I'm burstin' in and outta state
It's shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee
Because Renee uses code two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She said Renee has been shot
So cheeks, meet me up at St. Lukes
I jumps on the Van Wyck
I gotta make it there quick
A yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po nine
I'm doing a buck
Who gives a fuck
I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital
They tell me Mr. Cheeks
Renee is gone 
I'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto
So listen
This is how I shed my tears

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday

Freaky Tah,"this be a message to the ghetto when will this shit stop
we lost 2 ill niggaz B.I.G and 2pac
this goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
you can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
see you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
your life is how you living kid just give it your all
we strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
the plan's to make you niggaz understand, understood
yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
but that's all we know cause from the street we got the training

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast

yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
all the suffering we've been through niggaz still is into squeezing
mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
you rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
one night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
cause niggaz out there they felt that I owed them something
talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
a 13-year old could just up, and end me
if he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
now does that make shorty rock the man?
not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
it's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
that's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
so take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
to the motherfuckin day

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast 

2 of the illest rap artists underground bodies slain
they both did they thing went platinum in the game
at home where I zone there's a TV I watch
BET, MTV, video, music box
it bugs me out for real I'm in the zone kid that's ill
it only goes to show up in the rap game it's real
it's just a little something on my mind how I feel
now niggaz kick raps, and caps get peeled

kid I thought we was rhymin man fuck that actin tough
enough is enough let's dead that East and West stuff
I'm callin niggaz bluff yo my rap game be tuff
let's take it to the stage and let the lyric game buss
I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
to hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl

look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
that's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track
the media they tryin to throw dirt in the game
but me and my fam we found ways to explain
throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
it's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid

I'm in this tight situation
I'm at this chicks crib uptown 
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down 
Now it seems like a set-up 
and niggaz try to wet me from the door 
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour 
Shot through the glass hit the balcony 
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain
There's beef walkers walkin I gotta play it cool 
Even though he's firm with that I walk covered up my jewel
I'm in a tight situation? 

""Black B the shit went down world wide B""

""Word, what happened?""

""Yo nigga started mouthing off
I don't know if nigga's still breathing
All I know is that I made moues""

""Well yo, 8 moues I'ma need you my fault
I'll meet you there""

The block is rather hot they got surveillance tapes and cameras

Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty cant wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we wont forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool 
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover 
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long 
Shorty had to go back to work 
Something inside said that will work

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be to demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding
Like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street get your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinkin to me short 
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to 
I had to run her down the line this aint no walk through 
Now who the fuck you think you talkin to chick
Your complaining's makin me sick 
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday I be there fo rmy friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word
She began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing byebye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
To many threats kid 
Got to let her go
Always in your corner 
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give
We talked out
I'm feeling pain as it come to an end
I said to shorty ""I will always be your friend""
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I aint going nowhere
For real

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms

Little kids in sweaty suits, with niggas like Lost Boyz

Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga

[Freck Billionaire]
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got rich like Federline
Fuck a g-pack, I'll show you how to read crack
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac
The weed good price, plus it smoke speci
Three thousand full pound of some Dro Pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker
This is family nigga don't ever cross my brother
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty

[Paul Cain]
Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate

[Joe Budden]
Yo
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is San-jaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like +Brother Man+
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E.R
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans, g-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Techs now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards
Every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be trying to be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking
You gonna need a ""Weekend At Bernie's""
If you trying to see a +Dead Man Walking+

[Red Cafe]
I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For for the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low, kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gonna sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
East-side, west-side, I'll be in my Converse
This a convict rapping, It's a con's verse
Arm & Hammer mis-man, 'Los, Joey, or Ris-am
All they gotta do is chirp
And them things are gonna blis-am
Shake down, fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Block-ay block-ay

[Fabolous]
Now if they get me on wire traces
I'm gonna die in com-stat
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Fire bomb box, set up by your mom's block
Go off on time, 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by arms lock
We gonna go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found in a Bronx lot
Rifles on the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here that's better than buying Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Maybe' Miss
Before I pull this curb and start swerving like Baby sis
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors

This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree

be	-boy religion. I'll rock and claim position
Maim the opposition, tradition, got 'em on lock
Follow the greater mission, freedom marks the top
Beat 'em off the block, now cock-wrap they bop
Number one on street spots, Homeskill' the hard rock
I drop steady, cripplin non-believers like Teddy
Pendergrass, tense up ya tender ass, you're not ready
Hold steady, think first, my ink burst floods and blunder
Crown Hi-Tek sound thump pounds of thunder
Street hunger, the universal man works wonders
Mic and hand breakin land, rockin up from down under

I'm jiggy and all that, black and get control back
But fuck that, control over mind, body and soul

When I spit this here it's easy as.. {""1-2-3""}
+You Can ""Huh?"" You Can Hear Me+, you ain't heard nuttin yet

Practice the incredible, shit ain't even competable
Due to that I'm technical, TKO's I got those
I got control but I'm wreckless in studios
I got Harmony and Thug tendencies all in my Bones
No need to be flashy, for heads to recognize me
Hi-Tek throw them joints that magnetize me
We global, East, West, North, South, we robo
Hands that touch mic's get smacked 'cause that's a no-no

Before I lived the hustle, swore this poor man would give the law

They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold
My journeys, I march through madness like atorneys
Send you out on a gerdy talkin 'bout yo' eternity
Can't stand it, search for your wind like Ban Enti
One man band on the MP and a nigga ran simply
Hi-Tek, all these other niggas can exempt me
Say he's the nicest out loud and gently

Measurin blocks, releasin this live like Desert Fox
Hear spiritual, remain plentiful, same generals
Train criminals to get the most plus the minimals
Rob past, raw cash, facin the God last
Spot grabs, sure pop laugh, jump out of stock caps
For cop cash, watch taps, eyes on my top hat
Flop fast, stock crash, how when I drop math?
This rare rap, air vac', exit and fair fact
We share packs, stare back, cover our bear tracks
Ya peeps move, each choose, jump in our Jeep smooth

Quero um tempo pra ficar sozinho
Quantas vezes te falei que você ia me perder

Eu não aguento sua falsidade

Que apesar de ser tão forte disse não
Achou melhor tomar coragem pra dizer

Fred Applegate,"In all the famous love affairs
The lovers have to struggle
In garret rooms away upstairs
The lovers starve and snuggle

They're famous for misfortune which
They seem to have no fear of
While lovers who are very rich
You very seldom hear of

No little shack do you share with me
We do not flee from a mortgagee
Nary a care in the world have we
How can love survive?

You're fond of bonds and you own a lot
I have a plane and a diesel yacht
Plenty of nothing you haven't got
How can love survive?

No rides for us on the top of a bus
In the face of the freezing breezes
You reach your goals in your comfy old rolls
Or in one of your Mercedeses

Far, very far off the beam are we
Quaint and bizarre as a team are we
Two millionaires with a dream are we
We're keeping romance alive

Two millionaires with a dream are we
We'll make our love survive

No little cold water flat have we
Warmed by the glow of insolvency
Up to your necks in security
How can love survive?

How can I show what I feel for you?
I cannot go out and steal for you
I cannot die like Camile for you
How can love survive?

You millionaires with financial affairs
Are too busy for simple pleasure
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour
For l'amour all the poor have leisure

Caught in our gold platted chains are we
Lost in our wealthy domains are we
Trapped by our capital gains are we
But we'll keep romance alive

Trapped by our capital gains are we
We'll make our love survive

Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine

I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing.

I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.",Pick Yourself Up [*],1950
Fred Astaire,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely 
Never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it ?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Mm, mm, mm,  mm,
Just the way you look to-night.",The Way You Look Tonight [*],1950
Fred Astaire,"I was never able to recite a fable
That would make the party bright;
Sitting at the table I was never able
To become the host's delight
But now you've given me my after dinner story,
I'll just describe you as you are in all your glory.

[Chorus]
You were never lovelier,
You were never so fair,
Dreams were never lovelier,
Pardon me if I stare.

Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
I can only say they chose the proper place.
You were never lovelier,
And to coin a new phrase;
I was never luckier in my palmiest days.
Make a note, and you can quote me,
Honor bright,
You were never lovelier than you are tonight.

Fred Astaire,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",The Carioca,1953

Heaven, I'm in heaven 
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to climb a mountain 
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Will carry me through to heaven

Fred Astaire,"Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.

It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.

It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.

Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.

You kiss while you're dancing.
Not a bad idea. 
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.

Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.
You will find while you're dancing

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

And oh, what a sweet little miss was this
We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

And every night just to see this miss
He used to risk his scalp
For the house where she lived was away up high
And the poor guy didn't know how to fly
So he jumped from alp to alp
What a chump (What a chump)
To jump (To jump)
From alp to alp

And then beneath her balcony
He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""
That's the Swiss idea of a melody
And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""
He said, ""How I yearn for you, I burn for you, I do! I do!
Oh, lady, oh, I swear it on my knees
My love for you is just as strong as a piece of Sweitzer cheese""",Swiss Miss,1986

It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.
Remember it's my heart.
The heart with which so willingly I part.
It's yours to take to keep or break,
But please, before you start,
Be careful, it's my heart.
From: Gloria ""Montcomags""

Spring, Spring, Spring

All the henfolk are hatchin', while their menfolk are scratchin'
To ensure the survival of each brand new arrival
Each nest is twittering, they're all babysittering
Spring, Spring, Spring

Why, it's a beehive of budding son and daughter life
Every family has plans in view
Even down in the brook, the underwater life
Is forever blowin' bubbles too

Little skylarks are larking, see them all double-parking
Cuddled up, playin'possum, they're behind ev'ry blossom
Even the bubble-ink  
Is merrily wobble-ink

In his hole, though the gopher seems a bit of a loafer
The industrious beaver puts it down to Spring fever
While there's no antelope who feels that he can't elope

Each cocoon has a tenant, so they hung out a penant
Don't disturb please, keep waiting, we're evacuating
This home's my Mama's isle, soon have my own domicile

Lay off butter fat and all French fries

If their offspring are large, it might be dan-ga-roos
Why, they've just got to keep them pocket-size

Even though, to detract, Spring is more like a habit
Not withstanding, the fact is they endulge in the practice
Why, each day is Mother's Day 
The next day some other's day
Spring, Spring, Spring

To itself, each amoeba softly glows ?
While the proud little termite fills his life as a worm might
Old papa dragonfly is makin' his wagon fly
It's Spring, Spring, Spring

And from his eerie, the eagle with his eagle eye
Gazes down across his eagle beak
And a-fixing his lady with a legal eye
Screams, ""Suppose we set the date this week""

Ah, yes siree, Spring discloses, if it's all one supposes
Wagging tails, rubbing noses, but it's no bed of roses

So I think of things that'll tickle his funny bone

Lonely old ghost upstairs

Regular folks, droppin' our worldly cares
Swappin' our jokes, me and the ghost upstairs
And then he slaps his shroud and laughs out loud
And says ""Oh boy, that'll paralyze all the crowd""

Jolly old ghost upstairs

He's quite a cook, he serves a beautiful drink
He wrote a book and in invisible ink
I took a look and the title 'pon the page
Was 'The Groups of Wraith'

Once in a while he brings a gang of friends
Does it in style, careless of what he spends
And though the place is small we have a ball
'Cause you know those spooks don't require no room at all

We have some mighty fine affairs

We have some mighty fine affairs

To Harpo goes my shiny silk hat
And to heaven, I give a vow
To adore you, I'm starting now

Any yam today?
The sweet potatoes that he'll fry
Will be yam today

With every yam that he sells to you

Come and yam today

Come get what I've got
It will hit the spot
Get your sweet and hot

Fred Astaire,"I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began,

I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground,

Fred Astaire,"A police car and a screaming siren
A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete
A baby wailing and stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamp lights blinking, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth
Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Days of speed and slow time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays, that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway, that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and traveling on buses
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs,I say that's entertainment.

Fred Astaire,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Just like the strain of a haunting refrain, 
She'll start up on a marathon and run a-round your brain.

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.

That was me.
I clipped it and I saved it.

But no. No, no, no

Amos was... ZERO
i mean, when he made love to me, it was, like, he was fixing a carbouretter or sommink
'i love ya honey, i love ya'
Anywaays... I started fooling around
Then i started screwing around
-which is fooling around without dinner-
Then, I met Fred Casely
Wo said he could get me into Vaudeville
but, That didn't really work out as i planned
and I guess it didn't work out too great for fred either
So, I gave up on the Vaudeville idea

Fred Astaire,"What to say
Where to start
I’ll just tell what’s in my heart

Life is beautiful
In every way
Life is lovely
As a spring bouquet

Since I fell in love with you
Life is like a dream
That has come true

For life is sunshine

Fred Astaire,"Listen to the wailing of the willows,
Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Living in a world of different places, 
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see

My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear like a radiant star
First so near, then again so far

I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so
Far","So near and yet so far, song (from film ""You'll Never Get Rich"")",2002

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun

Is forever blowin' bubbles too

Cuddled up, playin'possum, they're behind ev'ry blossom

Is merrily wobble-ink

Gazes down across his eagle beak

If your time of life is at hand
Well don't be the rule, be the exception

I see in the mirror each morn

It's something daring, the Continental

An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, the Continental

You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, oh, it's continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental

You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control

With no insults, and all the morals

And christened it the Piccolino.

Everyone this season is strumming and humming a new melody.

e poi gettare via i perchÃ¨
amarti come sei
la prima volta, l'ultima ...

Champagne, per un dolce segreto
per noi, un amore proibito
ormai resta solo un bicchiere
ed un ricordo da gettare via

Lo so, mi guardate lo so
vi sembra una pazzia
brindare solo senza compagnia.
Ma io io devo festeggiare
la fine di un amore

L'altra notte mentre uscivo dal mio solito caffè, 
Quando incontro un bel mammifero modello centotré 

Fischio 
Che Bambola!

Riempiva un bel vestito di magnifico lame, 
Era un cumulo di curve come al mondo non ce n'è, 
Che spettacolo, le gambe, un portento, credi a me,

Che Bambola!

Ehi, ehi ,ehi, 
Le grido, piccola, dai, dai ,dai, non far la stupida, 
Sai, sai, sai, io son volubile, 
Se non mi baci subito tu perdi una occasioni 

Lei si volta, poi mi squadra come fossi uno straccino, 
Poi si mette bene in guardia come Rocky, il gran campioni
Finta il destro e di sinistro lei m'incolla ad un lampioni 

Fischio 
Che Bambola!

Lei, lei, lei, spaventatissima 
Lì per lì diventa pallida 
Poi, poi, poi allarmatissima 

Mi abbraccia per sorreggermi le faccio compassioni 
Sai com'è, ci penso sopra e poi decido che mi va 
Faccio ancora lo svenuto quella abbozza e sai che fa? 
Implorandomi e piangendo un bel bacio lei mi dà!

Se ci penso mi sento le ossa rotte
Beh, M'aspetta quella bionda che fa il pieno al Roxy Bar
L'amichetta tutta curve del capoccia Billy Carr

Che nebbia, che nebbia quella notte
Me le semino, tre auto poliziotte
Ma per un appuntamento, se c'è zucchero da far
Quando esiste l'argomento lo sapete so rischiar

Ci vado, la vedo, è lei
Ma dalla nebbia ne spuntano altri sei

Mentre, sotto ad un lampione

Mi ricordo di sei mascelle rotte
Ho un sinistro da un quintale
Ed il destro, vi dirò
Solo un altro ce l' ha eguale
Ma l' ho messo Kappa O

Li stendo, li conto, son sei
Poi li riconto perché non si sa mai
Ed intanto quella matta s'avvicina e sai che fa?
Mi sistema la cravatta
Mormorandomi, si va?

Che baci, che baci quella notte
Sono un duro, ma facile alle cotte
Mi son preso un imbarcata
Per la bionda platine

I don’t wanna misrepresent the miracle man
But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she’s on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it’s my gift
Her hand was heavenly
Since 1970
Every hug, every kiss, every book she read to me

An incredible sight
An unforgettable ride
And it still ain’t over
Tho I’m deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain’t trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don’t know what it cause
And I’m not saying that I’m any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain’t blind but it’s times, I’m too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it’s easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I’m loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn’t
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep
Imma pray for the angels he sent to me

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free

Fred De Palma,"Vedo te che ti allontani dalla ferrovia
Siamo passati dal buongiorno al buenos dias
Ti chiamo al telefono
Cade la linea, lo tiro via
E ho trovato un reggiseno tuo in tintoria
E mi chiedo cosa da te mi ha spinto via
Chiedi perché rido
Ti rende irascibile la mia ironia
Di te mi resta solo questa melodia
E la sento sempre meno mia
Baby, buenos dias
Baby, buenos dias

Ho ritrovato il mio cuore nello sterno
Il mio cuore è un organo scordato e mi ero scordato di averlo
Ti giuro che ad amarti ci provo
Anche se tu non riesci più a fidarti di un uomo
Quanto pesa sapere che vali
Ma non puoi separare i carati dall'oro
Ci svegliamo piangendo, sudati
Come fossimo nati di nuovo
Ora stiamo qui a guardare il sole
Aspettando che bruci il mondo
E da te io più vorrei allontanarmi e più ci torno
Ora siamo confusi
Giriamo al buio senza luce intorno
La nostra storia ormai è un tunnel senza luce in fondo
Diventiamo qualcuno per apparire
Cresciamo ad appassionarci
Invecchiamo per appassire
E tu mi guardi come un pazzo lunatico

Non sono io, Dio ho marcato troppo sul mio tratto somatico

Perdonami se insisto
Ricordami che esisto

Vedo il buio più scuro
Siamo così avanti che per noi è già futuro

Vedo te che ti allontani dalla ferrovia
Siamo passati dal buongiorno al buenos dias
Ti chiamo al telefono
Cade la linea, lo tiro via
E ho trovato un reggiseno tuo in tintoria
E mi chiedo cosa da te mi ha spinto via
Chiedi perché rido
Ti rende irascibile la mia ironia
Di te mi resta solo questa melodia

E la sento sempre meno mia
Baby, buenos dias
Baby, buenos dias

Non sono bravo a soffrire, lo vedi che soffro male?
Non riesco neanche a mangiare, ho paura di soffocare
Mi chiedo un uomo quanto ancora può sopportare?
Il problema è che quel che voglio non lo posso toccare
Ma appena lei mi vuole corro
Sono sempre sveglio e non so mai che ore sono
Penso solo a risolvere gli errori come Norton
Ho paura a guardarmi dentro, baby c'ho un cuore d'horror
E adesso che peso le parole cadono a goccie
E tu tieni le mani sotto a forma di coca
Così non ne perdi nemmeno un sorso
Lego un ago al filo del discorso così quando parlo ti cucio la bocca

A ripensare a te non ti ho mai vista ridere
A parte che con quelle quattro vipere
Che tradiscono per sentirsi libere
Hanno studiato lingue per mentire a più gente possibile

Perdonami se insisto
Ricordami che esisto
Vedo il buio più scuro
Siamo così avanti che per noi è già futuro

Vedo te che ti allontani dalla ferrovia

Fred De Palma,"Non sei qui, come mai
Mentre ci penso bevo drink e sto nei guai (sto nei guai)
Torna qui, dove vai
Canterai questa canzone si, ma la stonerai
E tu sei bella ma 'sto mondo no
Tieni il mio cuore appeso al collo come un ciondolo
E ti fai spazio tra i pianeti
Le stelle cadono ai tuoi piedi
E ora che sono solo in ogni mia scelta
Mi ricordi che il dolore è lì che mi aspetta
Mi dici come pensi io ti dia retta
Disegna il mio cuore, fai una linea retta
Tu nella vasca con le bolle
Io testa calda come un boiler
Ti ho sentita dire a tutti che farò una brutta fine, spoiler

Non volevi 'sta canzone ma già lo sai
La canterai
La canterai
E anche se, di 'sta canzone non ne parlarai
La canterai
La canterai

Perché parla di te

Ormai non mi chiedo neanche più dove sei
Tanto se uscissi di casa ti troverei
Ti vedo tutte le sere non è colpa mia
È la città che ha nostalgia di vederci insieme
Non dirmi che ci sei anche tu
Ogni sera ormai me la rovino

Dovrei cambiare casa e non vederti più
Ma finiresti ad abitare nel mio condominio

Si, è tutta colpa mia
Si dice meglio soli che mal accompagnati e sono sia
Solo che mal accompagnato
Perché quando sono solo io mi faccio compagnia
Ora sono all'aereoporto e mentre cammino rifletto
Ma è meglio se ora mi fermo
Perché mentre ti penso suona il metal-detector
Di te ricordo tutto, una memoria di ferro
E vado avanti con la testa
E non arriva l'assist
Nessuno sa davvero cosa passi
Non sai quello che trovi, sai solo cosa lasci
San dirti di cosa muori ma non di cosa nasci

Ora sono ricco col Cristal
Ma io mi sento un po' come
Quando c'è troppa gente in pista
E ti guardi intorno e ti rendi conto
Che hai perso i tuoi amici di vista

Che se vado in banca mi fanno l'astratto conto
C'è chi dice ""si fa il divo e non si va vivo manco morto
Sarà in qualche privè esclusivo
Che beve vino ad alto costo""
Ma io non li ascolto e cammino
Finché avrò l'asfalto sotto
Tanto qualsiasi
Strada io scelgo al bivio
Avrò sempre un auto contro
E se sei nato povero
Quelle catene di metallo
Te le togli per scappare dalle catene di montaggio
Ti dimentichi di loro
E quelle catene di metallo
Diventeranno d'oro giallo
E sarai schiavo di nuovo, nah

A furia di dare le perle anche ai porci
Finisce che i porci poi sembrano ostriche
T'abbasso la cresta fra, ti faccio le treccine giù
Ho visualizzato la tua fine hai le freccine blu

Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?
Asciugameno
E se lo faccio spero che ne chiuda una almeno
Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?

Ogni volta che lo chiedi io mi chiedo:
""Se i rapper fossero noi""

Che la tipa se s'incazza fra non ci lascia ci dissa!

Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper come noi

Sputo, cago, stupro mentre rappo multitask
Fatti due domande sceme e scemo dopo chiudi Ask
Qui mi pressa-no, ma quale ""Web Star"" bro
Ti schizzo in faccia mentre guardi il video web-cumshot

Quante cose dette su di me, cose stupide
Ultimamente chiunque si sente giudice, più umiltè
Frate fatti meno cessi e più bidet
La cover del tuo cell ha le orecchie, man, e le usa piu di te

Tra la morte e amici la prima tutta la vita
Non mi ascolto la tua merda sennò mi spunta la figa
Vuoi sfidarmi col freestyle? Ma farlo in chat non è una sfida
Sono tutte un po' suicide, ma poi nessuna si suicida

Hai fatto due foto non sei una modella
Io odio la donna moderna
Se metto le hogan e pesto una merda
Penso che la scarpa diventi più bella

Non siete creativi, siete cretini
Incredibile che vi crediate anche divi
Mi senti rappare
Mi chiedi respiri
Svolto la mia vita mica i risvoltini!

Fred De Palma,"Qualche volta
Penso di tornare da te
E se non l'ho ancora fatto
Non è perché l'amore sia finito
Io ti amo ancora
Non l'ho fatto solo perché
Perché ho paura
Di trovarti cambiato
Ma stasera
Ho deciso di tornare 
Tutt'al più
Mi accoglierai
Con la freddezza che
Non hai avuto mai
E forse fingerai
Di non sapere il nome mio
Magari parlerai
Dandomi del lei 
Oppure tutt'al più
Mi chiederai
Quanti ragazzi ho avuto
Dimenticando te
Eppure tu sai bene
Che una ragazza come me
Non scherza con l'amore
Non ha scherzato mai
Tutt'al più
Mi offenderai e
Poi mi caccerai
Dicendomi che oramai, no
Non mi interessa più
Una ragazza che
Serviva solamente
Per divertirsi un po'
E allora me ne andrò
E mi rincorrerai
Per chiedermi perdono
E mi accarezzerai
Ricorderai il mio nome
E quello che c'è stato
Magari fosse vero
E magari fosse vero
Tutt'al più
Ti troverò
Insieme a quella che
Ha preso il posto mio
E allora

Non ci crederai 
Infatti non ci credi mai 
Non ci credi mai

Ci messaggiamo 
""Come sto?"", ""come stai?"", ""bene"" 
Ma come siamo arrivati a un forse 
Da un forever

E da quando ci siamo lasciati 
I cuori instagrammati 
Ma se clicchi sulle mie foto 
Escono i cuori spezzati

E ti rivedo in un hostess 
Mentre mi prende all'imbarco la borsa 
Talmente uguali che mentre la guardo negli occhi 
Sembra che mi riconosca

E sembra fatto apposta 
Sulla targhetta c'è pure scritto il tuo nome 
È strano quando il destino 
Cambia destinazione

E insieme non riusciamo a stare 
Ma senza noi non ci sentiamo più vivi 
Noi che ci amiamo per mille ragioni 
Ora lasciamoci senza motivi

E ti giuro che io non lo so 
Se la distanza ci divide o no 
Ci siamo perdi io e te 
Tra i miei ""non lo so""
Ed i tuoi ""vorrei"" 
Adesso in che parte del mondo sei? 
Ti fai troppi viaggi che non sono i miei

Sei tu che guardi il cielo o lui che guarda te 
Se guardo quella foto io mi chiedo se 
Sei tu che guardi il cielo o lui che guarda te

Mi pensavi, chi ci crede? 
Noi che ci siamo lasciati con un ""ci si vede"" 
Io pieno di ma, lei piena di sé 
Ha gli occhi troppo grandi per guardare solo me

Io che non penso al futuro 
Perché il futuro è già oggi 
Devo imparare a lasciare il mio segno 
Senza lasciare i miei sogni

Le speranze con cui darsi carica 
I problemi di cui farsi carico 
Tu che non metti neanche l'orologio 
Per non sentire il tempo farsi rapido

E piangevi guardando là fuori 
In mezzo alle macchine che transitavano 
Perché dicevi che certi paesaggi 
Tu li vivi come stati d'animo

Noi parlavamo di tutto 
Ma forse un ""ti amo"" non siamo riuscito mai a dirlo 
Ma ci saremmo buttati nel vuoto 
Insieme solo per riempirlo

E ti giuro che io non lo so 
Se la distanza ci divide o no 
Ci siamo perdi io e te

Siamo immersi nel silenzio e nel rumore dei singhiozzi 
E tu che piangi fino a perdere il colore dei tuoi occhi

Sono un dipinto sopra il muro di Berlino 
Fatto nel minuto prima che cadesse giù 
Tu sei come un aquilone senza filo 
Che vola via da un bambino triste a testa in sù 

E a furia di guardare cosa fanno gli altri 
sei finita ad annoiarti 
Pensi la tua bellezza sia l'unica certezza che hai davanti 
Ti stai arrampicando sugli specchi in cui ti guardi 
E il mio cuore tra un martello ed incudine 
Dietro le porte del mio cuore c'è un macello, richiudile 
Andiamo a vivere insieme in solitudine 
Andiamo ad abitarla e a trasformarla in abitudine 

Mi chiedo come tu possa pensare che non abbia fatto niente per noi due

È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù

Mi volevi diverso
Ti dicevo non cambio
Ti imbruttisce il successo
Solo se non sai indossarlo
E stavi da sola per ore
Chiusa a piangere in bagno
Eravamo un dipinto bellissimo
Sopra la tela di un ragno
Ma tu ci credevi a sta favola
I nostri sogni dentro a una scatola
Senza nemmeno poi renderci conto
Che stavamo arredando la nostra trappola
Io ti dicevo ‘non ci son speranze’
Tu non credevi nelle disgrazie
Poi il cuore si spezza in due metà intatte
E i sogni diventano realtà infrante
No, no, vado via
Finché non avrò
Nostalgia della nostalgia

E anche questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù
Mi chiedo perché a volte
Le stelle sono poche
Perché non si accendono se non le guardi tu
E adesso che non ho te
Non è che
Ho smesso di pensarci su
E anche se questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù
Ma non mi ricordo come

Questa notte nel cielo
Nemmeno una stella
Anche la luna è vuota
Non riesco a vederla
Tu vuoi essere
La mia vita
O preferisci saperla?
Ma senza rompere il guscio
Non puoi scoprire una perla
Bruciavamo nel fuoco in tre ore
Poi cadevamo nel vuoto interiore
Ora che non c’è niente che mi fa impressione
So che non andrò all’inferno ma a un piano inferiore
L’amore dà sintomi e la fama agli intipodi
Ma io amavo i tuoi pregi
E i tuoi difetti
Amavo le tue curve
E pure i tuoi spigoli

Il vento parla
Sento gli spifferi

Fred Durst,"Yeah, gangsta's make the world go ?round
I heard that true
Make things go up an' down
I heard that's true

I been through the full court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine, the first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet
Down solid mashin' on top of concrete

Before all the ways of war
House an' car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
An' we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986

It's all about lics, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts, worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy, just worn all night

Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest hoes
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin' an' layin' some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
An' I'm walkin' on this earth like I don't give a fuck

An' now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
An' corrupt my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
An' back the fuck up with that buck free style

Nigga, what freestyle, nigga?
Walkin' on a razor blade
Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid, sunny California, baby

I got subs in my trunk an' it's bound to bump
Straight smashin', hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Kurupt??
Wassup? I'm fillin' in my right mind, one to the head
An' I'm on the smash, hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Fred??

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

I don't give a fuck, so fuck what they say
Nigga, won't you pass? Say, ?Pass the bombay?
Niggaz, they decide to ride an' they ride
Niggaz, they decide to lie an' they die

I can bust a fleet of hoes with my skills
I can make them hoes bow down, pay my bills
Think I can make them hoes convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them hoes in the scrill'?

If you love a bitch, a bitch can drive you crazy
Anythin' a hooker do, it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie 'coz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me

If you hang around with suckaz then you may be
Another type of brother I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
'Coz I'm tryin' to stay out the penitentiary

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Your favorite band is winger, 
Winger? 
And all you eat is Zingers. 
You're like a Fruity Pebble, your

Yea! 
It's just too bad that you're a fagot on a lower level. 
So you're from Jacksonville, kickin' it like Buffalo Bill. 
Gettin' butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck, 
While your sister's on her knees waitin' for your 
Little peanut.

Fred Everything,"All I want to do is love you
I just want to take you there

Baby, I don't want to argue
Don't even want to fight
I just want to love you
And hold you all the night

Nothing to do with how
Try to keep it happy
Then depress yourself to cry
All I want to do is love you
You've got to move on up

All I want to do is love you
I just want to take you there

The world is trying to make us
Go against our will
There's too many mountains
Grown up from a hill
Just take nothing less
Than the second best
Do not obey
What most people say
'Cause you can pass the test
All I want to do is love you
Baby, we've got to move on up
We've got to move on up

All I want to do is love you
I just want to take you there

It feels like I'm already there

The world is trying to make us
Go against our will
It's early in our language
Of how the human feels
I just want to love you
I just want to cry

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

Fred Fried,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

Where the mountains high
Seem to kiss the sky
Someone is out yonder, o'er the hills
Waiting patiently, Waiting just for me
 
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona, they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair
Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the water fall
I dread the dawn when I awake to find you gone
Ramona I need you my own
 
Let's wander out yonder o'er the hills
By a babbling brook
Where we'll find a nook
To build our own love nest, o'er the hills

Fred Griffin,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And then it had to be with you

Fred Griffin,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Fred Hammond,"(Background vocals) Whoa oo oa oa oa ooooa
Trusting in someone who?s made of flesh and blood
Such a frightful situation
Continual emotional intensive care
Is from too high expectations
So like a flower depends on rainfall
And like true lovers depend on phone calls
Like a song needs a tune
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

Some folks build their life only on wealth and fame
Or if they get high place employment
Not knowing they?re building hopes and dreams on sand
They soon are disappointed (disappointed)
So like a good day (good day) depends on sunshine (on sunshine)
And like the harvest depends on the time
Like the tide needs the moon
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
Like a comedian needs to be funny
And like a banker depends on money
Like a bride needs a groom
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You

Having a heavy heart in hand
Knowing full his promise still remains
That He would safely guide
If on his shoulders I would lean
And his perfect will I would remain

And weakens my confidence
Confusion urges me to curse the day
But when I patient wait
Under the shadow of His wing
Then I softly hear the Spirit say

All your understanding
Shall guard your heart and mind
Through Christ Jesus
