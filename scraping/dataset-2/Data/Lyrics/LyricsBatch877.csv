Ralph Penland,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1992
Ralph Penland,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast",I Fall in Love Too Easily,1992
Ralph Penland,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2000
Ralph Penland,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,2000
Ralph Peterson,"It sounds like a whisper
It seems like a dream
It breaks and it falls
It tears at the seam

Suppose that it happens
Suppose that it's real
Supposing you're right
Suppose it won't heal forever

And I will get old and tired
And nothing will get to me
No one will want to have me
Longing to be set free

If only the sun would take me
If only the wind was on my side [2x]

I wish I could see you
I'm stuck in a fog
I wish I had patience
A virtue says god

I wish I had wishes
A gold magic charm
I'd wish for more time
I'd wish to go far away

And I will get old and tired
And nothing will get to me
No one will want to have me
Longing to be set free

If only the sun would take me
If only the wind was on my side [2x]

I can hear voices calling
And I can feel weight upon my mind
You'll hold my hand in your hand
And after I'm gone you'll still have
Time to figure out the things,
The things that left me empty inside

If only the sun would take me
If only the wind was on my side [2x]
If only the wind was on my side...
Wooooa... on my side]",On My Side,1990
Ralph Peterson,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no diff'rence who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star,1994
Ralph Peterson,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,2000
Ralph Rainger,"Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

I never regret the things that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand
They just don't understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love

And I'm so in love

Ralph Rainger,"Night and you and Blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness there should be love

Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we, so are we

Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)

Ralph Rebel,"I caught the train, I met a dame,
She was a hipster, well and a real cool dame,
What a chick! She was pretty, from New York City,
Well and we trucked on down in that old Fairlane,

Ralph Reichert,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2004
Ralph Schuckett,"I only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold
You just might get-a left now out in the cold

Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold
Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold
",Out in the Cold [#][*],1971
Ralph Schuckett,"Some people say life's like a merry-go-round
I think it's more like a ferris wheel
'Cause sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
Sometimes you just don't know what to feel

And just when you think you've got the game figured out
And you say you've had enough
The mysterious mad man with his hand on the lever
Don't seem to never ever want to let you off

You can't get off this wheel of karma
You can't stop the hands of time

Now I have a friend, I might have a few
Sometimes I think they just don't care
But I think sometimes they think the same thing of me, yeah
You might say we've got a problem there

You know we all got this habit
We like to talk too much
And that always tends to slow you down
But we never change direction
We just keep going round and round and round and round

And let me off this wheel of karma
Let me stop the hands of time

Seems like I've been around so many places
And I must have learned a lot of things
And although I ain't yet come up with a so-called answer
At least I think I finally learned how to sing

And there's just a few things I ain't got sorted out
Sometimes they make my brain get sore
Like if kids were left of all devices
Would they ever come up with a thing like war

Let us off this wheel of karma
Let us stop the hands of time",The Wheel,1975
Ralph Sharon,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Ralph Sharon,"The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gray
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me",I Left My Heart in San Francisco,1962
Ralph Sharon,"Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came, my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go
Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know

Ralph Sharon,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Ralph Sharon,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.

That this is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger than Spring",This Is All I Ask,1997

High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Every day would be the first day of spring
Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man could end
No my friend, not if I ruled the world
Every head would be held up high
There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky
If the day ever dawned when I ruled the world",If I Ruled the World,1999
Ralph Sharon Trio,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Fading too soon, that's why I say

Till a fine young American from the sea, to her garden came

For many years where I may lay.

She's drinking away her troubles

A shining in the moonlight

With a forty-four around her

As I listened on and on
Heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong

And you will never loose his love

Call for me, I will be there
If I cannot come myself
Please, don't call on no one else

I will wait for you in the morning
I will wait for you in the dawn
I will wait for you, my darling
I will wait for you 'till I'm gone

Sun is spinning, my oh my
Stuck up on this barren hill
Pray for rain, it never will

Count the days until parole
With silver chalk marks on my soul

I will wait on burning sand
Wade to you through rivers and
Make your every dream come true
If that is given me to do

I will wait for you in the morning
I will wait for you in the dawn
I will wait for you, my darling
I will wait for you 'till I'm gone

Seven horses dressed in gray
Come to bear my heart away
Nothing ventured, nothing lost
I would rather pay the cost

Set my reason on the line
Wreck my health and lose my mind
Grit my teeth, ignore the pain
Smile at loss and count it gain

I will wait for you in the dawn
I will wait for you, my darling

There was nothing else to know
I was yours, you were mine

Sun broke through the clouds to shine
Summers come and summers go
Can't say where but this I know

Ralph Stanley & the Clinch Mountain Boys,"In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
White dove will mourn in sorrow
The willows will hang their heads
I'll live my life in sorrow
Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray",The White Dove,2004

We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way

To worship our Lord up above
And let all our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above

Wise men came from near and far
To see the Jesus in the manger
The pathway lighted by the stars

No more I'll sleep there all alone
But carried up to Him on high
On the wings of angels headed home

They crucified our Lord and Savior
He humbly died there on the cross
That we might someday rise and join Him
Our souls be saved and not be lost

Ralph Sutton,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

This is how the story ends:

Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:

Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why,

Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2002

Ralph Towner,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!",See,1994
Ralph Tresvant,"I've been feeling lately like being single or just alone,
to get into myself
Love ain't easy, it can be crazy games that we play,
Sometimes the rules have to change
I don't wanna treat her cruel, but I like honesty,
so what am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I guess I'll do what I gotta do and break her heart.
I don't wanna see her cry but it's hard to live a lie
So I gotta do what I gotta do and break her heart
And though I love the girl I know that the best thing
is for us to be apart

Any good relationship starts inside of a happy man
I think she will understand
If I tell her straight then she can only respect me,
even if we don't agree
I don't wanna treat her cruel, but I like honesty baby,

Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when road is alone 
Keeps me company with love to guide you
He walks beside you just like he walks with me

When I am weary, and filled with despair 
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there
And who gives me faith 
I will never, never, never, never, never doubt
Somebody bigger yeah 
Somebody bigger than me and you
Bigger than you and I
Somebody bigger 
My Lord is bigger than you
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when the road is long
Keeps you company with love to guide you 
He walks beside you just like he walks with me 

Somebody bigger than you and I 
Bigger than the open sky 
Bigger than the tallest tree
Bigger than the deepest sea 
Somebody deeper than the desert sands 
Bigger than the tallest man 
And phatter than the phattest phat
Bigger than the Shaq attack

Ralph Tresvant,"When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while

Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

[Chorus]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl, understand me
You will always be my candy girl

While you sucked caramel apple lollipops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that want to socialize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the temperature was high as could be
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled, I remember all that

[Chorus]

(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

[Chorus]

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
Candy girl
All I want to say
(Word is bond sweetheart)
I need your love
(I swear I'm down for whatever)
Candy girl
(sometimes you gotta go back home)
Look so sweet

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the 'Thriller in Manila'
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drug flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia

Dímelo tú también

Si pensaste cuando
Tu te fuiste que me moriría
Yo te digo que te
Equivocaste por pensar así

Porque yo soy uno de
Los hombres que toda la vida
A mi me gusta sonreír pasar
Los días tan feliz para sobrevivir

Yo te deseo bien con tu pasión
Mañana ha de nacer un nuevo amor
El cielo sigue azul
Tú volverás a amar

Na, na, na

Yo te deseo bien con tu pasión
Mañana ha de nacer un nuevo amor
El cielo sigue azul
Tú volverás a amar

Es por eso que te pido este favor
Hablaremos con cariño y razón
Yo te deseo bien
Dímelo tú también
Yo te deseo bien
Dímelo tú también

She's got a hold on me
She got her hand on my soul
I can't quit her
'Cause I see her face everywhere I go
In the city streets, in the country fields
In the back of my mind
I know it can't be real
For a woman to possess
All the tenderness she had
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
'Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me
Yeah, I know
I can't quit her
'Cause on my darkest night
She comes on like a light
I can't quite her
Try as I may, with all my might
She had a woman's touch
And a young girls eyes
And in seconds flat I was proselytized
Turned around
And made to feel sweet love
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
'Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me

And he fights his whole soul all the best to find some

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand

Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,1964

Most anywhere you go,
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe.

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar.
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law.

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
Did offer him my hand.
He gave me a string of horses
So old they could not stand.

And I nearly starved to death, boys,
He did mistreat me so.
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw.
Nearly drove me crazy
With the waggin' of his jaw.

And the tellin' of his story,
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe.

Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so.
I'm still punchin' cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go,
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.",Diamond Joe,1964

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time

He robbed the Danville train
He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor
He'd a hand, a heart, and a brain

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor
He couldn't see a brother suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Springfield bank
And he stopped the Glendale train

Poor Jesse had a wife, a lady all her life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave

It was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward
And I wonder how he feels
For he slept in Jesse's bed and he ate o' Jesse's bread
But he laid Jesse James in his grave  

It was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Gallatin Bank
An' carried the money from the town
It was at that very place that they had a little chase
For they shot ol' Captain Sheets to the ground

Poor Jesse had a wife to morn for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave  

They went to a crossing, not very far from there
And there they did the same 
For the agent on his knees delivered up the keys
To the outlaws, Frank an' Jesse James  

It was on a Wednesday night, not a star was in sight
When they robbed the Glendale train

Just talking with his family brave
When Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night
And laid poor Jesse in his grave

Now, the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to die
It was one of his own gang called little Robert Ford
An' he shot Jesse James on the sly

Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward

And there are many who never saw his face
He was born one day in the County of Clay
And he came from a solitary race

He said there's no one man with the law in his hand

Of Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw, Oklahoma knew him well.
Was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in the wagon as into town they rode.
A deputy sheriff approached them in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard.
Well, Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down.
Then he took to the trees and rivers to lead a life of shame.
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name.
Yes he took to the trees and timbers on the Canadian river shore,
And the outlaw found a welcome at many a farmer's door.
Yes, there's many a starving farmer, the same story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage and saved their little home.
Others tell about the stranger who came to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin left a thousand dollar bill.
It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas day
Came a whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say,
""Well, you say that I'm an outlaw, and you say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief.""
Well, as through the world I've rambled, I've seen lots of funny men,

By the fire in that neat little cabin

They moved us miners out of doors
Out from the houses that the company owned
We moved into tents at old Ludlow

I was worried bad about my children
Soldiers guarding the railroad bridge
Every once in a while a bullet would fly
Kick up gravel under my feet

We were so afraid they would kill our children
We dug us a cave that was seven foot deep
Carried our young ones and a pregnant woman
Down inside the cave to sleep

That very night you soldiers waited
Until us miners were asleep
You snuck around our little tent town
Soaked our tents with your kerosene

You struck a match and the blaze it started
You pulled the triggers of your gatling guns
I made a run for the children but the fire wall stopped me
Thirteen children died from your guns

I carried my blanket to a wire fence corner
Watched the fire till the blaze died down
I helped some people grab their belongings
While your bullets killed us all around

I will never forget the looks on the faces
Of the men and women that awful day
When we stood around to preach their funerals
And lay the corpses of the dead away

We told the Colorado governor to call the President
Tell him to call off his National Guard
But the National Guard belong to the governor
So he didn't try so very hard

Our women from Trinidad they hauled some potatoes
Up to Walsenburg in a little cart
They sold their potatoes and brought some guns back
And put a gun in every hand

The state soldiers jumped us in a wire fence corner
They did not know that we had these guns
And the red neck miners mowed down them troopers
You should have seen those poor boys run

We took some cement and walled that cave up

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your dust bowl and Westward we rolled
And your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold

I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California, Arizona, I harvest your crops
Well its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in the Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win

It's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die

Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty,1995
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country.
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball.

I'll take you through a door, and up a high stairs.
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere,
I will let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance round that big Christmas tree.

You ask about work and you ask about pay;
They'll tell you that they make less than a dollar a day,
Working the copper claims, risking their lives,
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air,
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere,
Before you know it, you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall.

Well, a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano, so you gotta keep quiet.
To hear all this fun you would not realize
That the copper-boss thug-men are milling outside.

The copper-boss thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""There's a fire!""
A lady, she hollered, ""There's no such a thing!
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.""

A few people rushed, and it was only a few
""It's only the thugs and the scabs fooling you.""
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor.
The gun-thugs they laughed at their murderous joke,
While the children were smothered on the stair by the door.

Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree.
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there were seventy-three.

The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon,
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned,
""See what your greed for money has done."" ",1913 Massacre,1996

Knew the train would roll that day, but I did not know what time. 

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time. 
Knew the train would roll that day but I did not know what time. 

Good morning Mister Railroad Man, what time does your train roll by? 
Nine-sixteen and two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five. 

At nine-sixteen, two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five. 
Thank you Mister Railroad Man, I want to watch your train roll by.

She wore her hat on the back of her head like high-tone people all do,

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"In bed with my woman, just singin' the blues, 
Heard the radio tellin' the news: 
That the big Red Army took a hundred towns, 
And Allies droppin' them two-ton bombs. 
Started hollerin', yellin', dancin' up and down like a bullfrog!

Doorbell rung and in come a man, 
I signed my name, I got a telegram. 
Said, ""If you wanna take a vacation trip, 
Got a dish-washin' job on a Liberty ship."" 
Woman a-cryin', me a-flyin', out the door and down the line!

'Bout two minutes I run ten blocks, 
I come to my ship, down at the dock; 
Walked up the plank, and I signed my name, 
Blowed that whistle, was gone again! 
Right on out and down the stream, ships as fur as my eye could see, woman a-waitin'.

Ship loaded down with TNT 
All out across the rollin' sea; 
Stood on the deck, watched the fishes swim, 
I'se a-prayin' them fish wasn't made out of tin. 
Sharks, porpoises, jellybeans, rainbow trouts, mudcats, jugars, all over that water.

This convoy's the biggest I ever did see, 
Stretches all the way out across the sea; 
And the ships blow the whistles and a-rang her bells, 
Gonna blow them fascists all to hell! 
Win some freedom, liberty, stuff like that.

Walked to the tail, stood on the stern, 
Lookin' at the big brass screw blade turn; 
Listened to the sound of the engine pound, 
Gained sixteen feet every time it went around. 
Gettin' closer and closer, look out, you fascists.

I'm just one of the merchant crew, 
I belong to the union called the N. M. U. 
I'm a union man from head to toe, 
I'm U. S. A. and C. I. O. 
Fightin' out here on the waters to win some freedom on the land.

Blue eyes cryin' in the rain.
When we kissed goodbye and parted,
I knew we'd never meet again.

Only memories remain.
through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain.

Someday when we meet up yonder,
We'll stroll hand in hand again,
In a land that knows no parting,
Blue eyes crying in the rain.

Well, it filled her old heart full of joy 
But she didn't know 'til she read the inside 
It was the last one from her darling boy 

""Dear Mom,"" was the way that it started
""I miss you so much,"" it went on 
""And, Mom, I didn't know that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won"" 

""I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom

And would come home with mud on my feet""

And mom we will carry them through 
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get 
But for now I'll just say I love you""

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

I was trailed by twenty hounds 
Didn't get to sleep that night 
Till the morning came around 

chorus:
I set out running but I take my time 
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine 
If I get home before daylight 
I just might get some sleep tonight 
I ran into the Devil, babe 
He loaned me twenty bills 
I spent that night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills 

I ran down to the levee 
But the Devil caught me there 
He took my twenty-dollar bill 
And he vanished in the air 

Got two reasons why I cry 
away each lonely night 
First one's named sweet Ann Marie 
and she's my heart's delight 
Second one is prison, baby 
the sheriff's on my trail 
And if he catches up with me 
I'll spend my life in jail 

Got a wife in Cheno, babe 
And one in Cherokee 
First one says she's got my child 
But it don't look like me

You can borrow from a friend 
But the Devil will give you twenty 
When your friend only got ten

Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be

If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry

Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none

Feelin' full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave this dark behind

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Prettyboy Floyd,1998

When I heard the report of a pistol
I hollered, ""I wonder what was that!""

""That was a report of a pistol""

And I thought I was gonna faint when he said it
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Lord, I knew the President was supposed to be down the depot that day
But I just wouldn't let myself believe that he'd been shot

So I told my brother, I said, ""Hey let's get on a train
And go to that Big House up there and see how the President is""

""Let's go up there to where he's laid up hurt and sick we'd see him""
So we went on up there and that big White House
And there was a soldier boy standin' round upside, outside

And, I sidled up to him and I said to that soldier boy
I said ""Who was it that did it?
Who was it that shot the President?""
And he said that, ""It was Charlie Guiteau that shot Mr. Garfield""

And I said, ""Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man

And she said, ""Now James"", she called him James

She said, ""James, I won't hear to that now
'Cause I love you too much""

And he said that ""You'll make some good man a good wife, good wife
You'll make some man a good wife gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life, good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life""

That's what he said, ""Don't pull in single harness all your life""

Well a little while later, we come back around there
And things have changed
The flag was hangin' halfway up the flagpole

And everybody was cryin' and standin' 'round sad
And I walked back up to this soldier boy and I said
""Soldier boy, is he, is Mr Garfield?"" and he said, ""Yeah, he's gone""

Gonna lay him by that cold lonesome branch down low
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
Oh, Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low

Have you heard the news?
Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low, Lord

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time, too
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess out of you

Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon

Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you, and man, they expect the same

Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost

I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough",Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,2007
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Two men rode in from the south, a rainy autumn night
The Sky above and the mud below
They walked into the Deacon's bar, they were Mexican by sight
The sky above and the mud below
They threw a horsehair bridle down, we trade this for whiskey rounds
The Deacon slams a bottle down, the two men start to drinkin'

Their hair was long and black, tied up behind their ears
Their faces were identical, like one man beside a mirror
Then someone whispered that beats all, their wanted posters on the wall
Twin brothers name of Sandoval, horse thieves from Boquillas

Now the bridle and the belts they wore were braided gray and black
The color of a roan horse once belonged to Deacon Black
The fastest horse for miles around, he'd been stolen from the old fairground
A month ago outside of town we tracked and never found him

Now the Deacon was a preacher who had fallen hard from grace
He owned the bar and a string of quarter horses that he'd race
Yea, Deacon he could drink and curse, though he still quoted sacred verse
He was sheriff, judge; he owned the hearse, a man you did not anger

The sky above, the mud below, the wind and rain, the sleet and snow
Two horse thieves from Mexico drinkin' hard and singin'

One brother he spoke English, Deac inquires as to their work
The man says mister we braid horsehair bridles, ropes and quirts
Yea, that fine bridle we did make, a roan horse killed by leg-bone break
He's horsehair rope now; horse-meat steak, we cleaned him to the bone

Well these gentlemen they were ignorant or didn't know just where they were
The Deacon's face grew darker as he measured every word
You horsehair braidin' sons o' witches stole my claim to earthly riches
Someone go and dig a ditch, there may well be a hangin'

One brother reached inside his shirt searching for his gun
Too late, for Deac had whipped around his sawed off Remington
The twins, they raised their hands and sneered, Deac was grinnin' ear to ear
He says court's in session, hear ye hear, yours truly is presidin'

Well the trial commenced and ended quick they didn't have a hope
Deac says we'll cut your hair now boys and you can braid yourselves a rope
The Old Testament, it says somewhere eye for eye and hair for hair
Covet not thy neighbors mare, I believe it's Revelations

Now the fancy horsehair bridle, it hangs on Deacon's wall
Next to that wanted poster of the brothers Sandoval
And he twisted rope so shiny black, the artifact that broke their necks
Their craftsmanship he did respect, they shoulda stuck to braidin'

You know the family is the solution to the world's problems today
Now let's take a look at the family
In the family the father is like the head, the leader, the director
Not domineering, but showing love, guidance
For everyone else in the family
Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
There's supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not
'Cause you'll bleed

Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night,2012
Ramin Karimloo,"The day starts, the day ends
Time crawls by
Night steals in, pacing the floor
The moments creep,
Yet I can't bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing

And weeks pass, and months pass
Seasons fly
Still you don't walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more.

And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the cold night air

And years come, and years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can't be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more

And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you're not here

Let hopes pass, let dreams pass
Let them die
Without you, what are they for?
I'll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more",Til I Hear You Sing,2012
Ramin Karimloo,"Inside a second you can hear a flower growing in the wind
But does it reach you when there's darkness all around
How many days will this go on
How many thoughts can I obsess
Why do we come apart
And watch it all go down

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

I see it shining on the sun
A road that leads beyond this place
A way to push aside the walls that block our path
If time can truly be a lie
There's nothing left but you and I
Denying everything and shattering the glass

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

Out of mind out of time
All alone stuck at home
Can't decide Full of pride
I want it all
Left to be only me
Far away everyday
Sanity Vanity
I want it all

Symbolize separation
Let me be set me free

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

La encontré en el camino

O tiene un amor escondido

El que se ahoga un gemido, no, no, no

Un corazón al desnudo

Quisiera repetir ese pasado

Pero ya es muy tarde, el mal ya esta hecho
Y escrito en tu vida todo tu desprecio
Que después que te diviertes abandonas
Hoy sin remordimiento dices que te deje sola…
Y para colmo de mis males
Y con la mente dios sabe
Lo mucho que te quiero y lo que te necesito
La gente me gritaba, que no me convenías
Que tu no eras buena y yo te lo creía

Pues a mi no me importaba

Que en ti no ay inocencia
Tienes corazon de piedra

I can praise him in a dance (oh)
I can praise him in a song
Every chance I get to praise
I'm gonna turn it turn it out

I have a right to praise
As much as anyone living today
I'm gonna celebrate
You better move on out my way
He's given life to me
And that more abundantly
I must respectfully

I was never the kind of girl that would go and look four ways
To make my life and yours have better days no ways

Everywhere I looked there was nobody

I showed I'd never leave you alone
But you needed what you wanted
Then you asked it was done

I told you I'd be there for you
Isn't my power strong enough for you
What must I do to show that I am true
If you look, you will find
That it's yours, that I know

I was never the kind of girl to believe what I couldn't see
For the world was mad at me and I was mad at He
I never really had it all but I wanted to be closer to God

Ich nehm sie heut gerne mit zu mir nach haus
Sie wirkt so kühl an sie kommt niemand ran
Doch vor der Kamera da zeigt sie was sie kann 

Sie trinkt in Nachtclubs immer Sekt, korrekt
Und hat hier schon alle Männer abgecheckt
Im Scheinwerferlicht ihr junges lächeln strahlt
Sie sieht gut aus und Schönheit wird bezahlt, ja

Und wird von Millionen Augen angeguckt

Mit einem Fächer jeden Tag
Der Alte macht das Wasser glatt

Ich werf den Stein zu meinem Spaß

Der Alte sieht mich traurig an
Und hat es wieder glatt gefegt

Im weißen Sand der alte Mann
Zitternd seine Pfeife raucht
Nur das Wasser und ich wissen
Wozu er diesen Fächer braucht

Die Ahnung schläft wie ein Vulkan
Zögernd hab ich dann gefragt
Den Kopf geneigt es schien er schläft
Hat er bevor er starb gesagt

Das Wasser soll dein Spiegel sein
Erst wenn es glatt ist, wirst du sehen
Wie viel Märchen dir noch bleibt
Und um Erlösung wirst du flehen

Den fächer an den Leib gepresst
Im Todeskrampf erstarrt die Hand
Die finger mussten sie ihm brechen
Der Fächer bleibt zurück im Sand

Den Alten ruf ich jeden Tag
Er möchte mich doch hier erlösen
Ich bleib zurück im Mittagswind
Und in dem Fächer kann ich lesen

In the grave an angel's choir

Alone in fear they question why

Hab' mich geniert
Doch hab' es nie bereut

Sie rief mir Worte ins Gesicht,
Die Zunge lustgestreut
Verstand nur ihre Sprache nicht
Ich hab' es nicht bereut

Oh non rien de rien
Oh non je ne regrette rien

Wenn ich ihre Haut verließ 
Der Frühling blutet in Paris

Ich kannte meinen Körper nicht
Den Anblick so gescheut
Sie hat ihn mir bei Licht gezeigt
Ich hab es nie bereut

Die Lippen oft verkauft so weich
Und ewig sie berühr'n
Wenn ich ihren Mund verließ
Dann fing ich an zu frieren

Sie rief mir Worte ins Gesicht,
Die Zunge lustgestreut
Verstand nur ihre Sprache nicht
Ich hab' es nicht bereut

Oh non rien de rien
Oh non je ne regrette rien

Wenn ich ihre Haut verließ 
Der Frühling blutet in Paris

Ein Flüstern fiel mir in den Schoß
Und führte feinen Klang
Hat viel geredet nichts gesagt
Und fühlte sich gut an

Sie rief mir Worte ins Gesicht
Und hat sich tief verbeugt
Verstand nur ihre Sprache nicht
Ich hab' es nicht bereut

Oh non rien de rien
Oh non je ne regrette rien

Wenn ich ihre Haut verließ 
Der Frühling blutet in Paris

In Paris

Wenn ich ihre Haut verließ 
Der Frühling blutet in Paris

In Paris

Wenn ich ihre Haut verließ 
Der Frühling blutet in Paris",Frühling in Paris,2009

Macht euch bereit
