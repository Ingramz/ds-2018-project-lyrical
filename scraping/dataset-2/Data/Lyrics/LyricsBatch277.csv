Fred Hammond,"Unconditional, unconditional
Unconditional, unconditional

Who else would let someone nail them to a cross
For the sake of others so they would not be lost
No one, no one will go that far for us

Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong
But still extend them grace
No one, no one have so much love for us

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

Who else but Him, He's a constant friend
Even when others turn their backs against
No one, oh no one is always there for us
So what kind of love

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

So even when your closest friends and family give up on you
There's not a day when you can't depend on Him

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

The kind of love He shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

Fred Hammond,"Blessed (x4)

We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed

(Verse 1)
Since thou has walked uprightly
As a light in a dark land
Since thou has placed in thy heart
All the Lord's commands
He's set thee above nations
and cast thine enemies away
He's standing up within thee
So let me hear you say

(Repeat Chorus)

We know that God's word
is clothed in truth and righteousness
We are His children
and with our heart we do confess

(Repeat Chorus)

Late in the midnight hour
Go's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favor

Fred Hammond,"When the battle makes me weary
It seems that I've lost ground
It's so hard to hear Your voice Lord
With distractions all around
I try to lift my hands, to give You praise
But then a spirit of heaviness
Tries to shield Your face, so I'm saying breathe

[Chorus]
Breathe into me oh Lord, the breath of life
So that my spirit would be whole
And my soul made right
Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day
So that my heart is pure before You, always, always

Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul
It's only by Your hand
That I can be made whole
So Lord breathe on me
And revive my spirit within
And I'll never be the same

[Chorus]

Condemnation tries to hold me
Like a prisoner in chains
And the weight of my burdens
Is calling out my name
That's when I lift up my voice worship You
Because I know
You promised You would wash me
Jesus wash me white as snow

Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul
It's only by Your hand, that I can be made whole
So Lord let Your breath revive me again
And I'll never be the same
I will never be the same, I will never be the same

[Chorus]",Breathe into Me Oh Lord,1996
Fred Hammond,"I'm not the same

I was lost, didn't know my future
So alone, couldn't see who He was
But He chose me, changed my life completely
Fixed my heart, cleansed me and made me holy

It was no good that I've done
To make You call me one of Your sons
Couldn't pay the price to save my life
But You took the cost, and found what was lost

[Chorus]
Call me righteous, since He changed my nature
Call me righteous, changed my name
Call me righteous, I'm a brand new creature
Call me righteous, I'm not the same

I can't believe it, He knew all bout me
Still He loved me enough to forgive me
I never thought my name would be royal
Since He gave I will give Him all

It was no good that I've done
To make You call me one of Your sons
Couldn't pay the price to save my life
But You picked up the cost
And You brought back what was lost

[Chorus]

Baptized me, justified me, purified me
When He changed my nature
Sanctified me, glorified me
When He changed my name
He just called me righteous, say

For be grace we are saved
It's a grace thing
My name has been changed
He just called me righteous, say",Call Me Righteous,1996
Fred Hammond,"Lord my heart chases after Thee
How shall I draw You close to me
A broken spirit and a contrite heart
To this You will draw nigh and I'll draw nigh

[Chorus]
I will draw nigh to You and You will draw nigh unto me
I'll sing a serenade while tears of joy wash my face
You are my reward nothing else compares to You Lord
My God and my salvation 
I'll draw nigh to You, I'll draw nigh to You

Craving righteousness I'm thirsty for Your presence 
With all I have I'll worship the beauty of Your holines

Fred Hammond,"He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty

Fred Hammond,"Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Never go away

Gotta be something about this time of year
That makes everybody act just a little more sincere
There's nothing like stepping outside
To exchange a neighbor's smile
Or just shaking hands a little longer, maybe talk a while

Lugging shopping bags down the street
Making time to speak to everybody that you meet
Making the cruise through the old neighborhood
Just taking in who's decorated and it's all good

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same

I had to stop over my mom's crib the other day
'Cause she's getting older now, gotta make sure she's okay
A smile and a hug would do her heart some good
Just chilling with family on Christmas like a family should

I am grateful for all that God has given me
I'm compelled to go help somebody else in need
Come back home and in for the night
Telling the kids the season's really all about Christ

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same, the same, the same

Why can't we show each other the same love?
The same, the same good love, real love
To me, once a year is really not enough

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on
Why does this feeling had to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same

On and on, on and on, and on, say

Fred Hammond,"All the angels held their breath
As Heaven put on human clothes
Rang the news God did not forget
His promise that was sent from the prophets old

The answer came in a sacred birth
Truth and justice, meek and mild
All the hope and the peace on earth
Rested in the hands of a newborn child

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

For the ones who were lost He came
Every child of Adam's fall
Emmanuel was the precious name
Of the small boy who would grow
And would touch us all

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
A child to save the world

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

So let the kings and the nations bow
To the baby so divine
As we lift up our voices now
Praises to the Savior of all mankind

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Took a child to save the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
He came to seek the lost like you and I

He came to seek and save
Redeem us back to Him
For God so loved the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son

If you will believe in Him eternal life you'll find

As Your glorious return is approaching fast
It's not enough for us to sit and wait
As Your awesome power on Earth we must demonstrate

As Your children who seek Your face
We sincerely come to You
'Cause we can't move until You saturate us, oh Lord

Oh Lord won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit
Come on let it rain on us
With the oil of Your anointing
And Your glory like a flood

As sons and daughters, Lord, we do rely
On Your word that said we'd prophesize
And being strong in faith, flesh we defeat
And the Gospel in our mouth we set the captives free

As Your children who seek Your face
We sincerely come to You
'Cause we can't move until You saturate us

Oh Lord, won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit
Come on let it rain on us
With the oil of Your anointing
And Your glory like a flood

Pour out Your Holy Spirit
Come on let it rain on us

And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through

Before I waste another day

Fred Hammond,"(Verse 1)
The evening now in sight
I earnestly contend
To just stay grounded
With the absence of the light
The enemy moves in
And I am surrounded
With a weary heart
The battle goes on
Lord I will rest in the Words
That You spoke to me

(Chorus)
You are my Life
You are my Strength
My Faithful Defense and my Cover
My Shield and Shelter
Savior and Shepherd
You're my Life and my Strength
Jesus You Are

(Verse 2)
The warfare rages on
The toll it takes is that
My heart is tender
My spirit yet is strong
But as usual my flesh
Wants to surrender
Though it's hard to wait
On Your Word I'll depend
And believe with my heart
Until the end

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
In my distress
I called on You
And from Your throne
You heard me and saved me

You are, You are, You are
You are, You are, You are
Oh, You are

But let me say I know that feeling well

And then watch them take a downward spin

Let me encourage you while I encourage me

But He'll speak peace and it will come to an end

The truth is He cannot lie
I'm in His hands and I'm on his mind
He promised me He'd always be there
So by faith He will answer my prayer

All things are working for me even things I can't see

Because I felt let down, let down, let down
But I won't always receive good, I know
But a praise in my heart will remain, oh

Know sometimes it will get rougher
But say, Lord, I love you more

You have been my strength in the time of weakness
There's never been a time I couldn't count on You
So I will bless You, oh, Lord, in the midst of the people

Come on somebody, right here, right now
We come to give Your name to glory
Somebody help me
Sisters tell me something, come on

Looked around the week was gone
Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known
That the struggle I had faced wasn't over
Drama won't leave me alone

When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint
My first and the last real defense is to stand and to say

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Join in together like this, like this come on
Sister tell me something else

Turned around I'd made it through
Wasn't sure of how I would but the Lord you knew
That my strength would surely fade but You'd cover
And my joy You would renew

You know the enemy seeks and he roars with his plans to abuse
In the midst of his rage and his lies let us stand on the truth

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what the circumstance
I know my life is in His hands
The storms may come but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say
That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way
But this will be my choice, will be my choice

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether this or that, just don't hold back
Keep your praise flowing

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praisin' God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your faith always

No matter what the day may bring to you

There’s no one there to see me
Participating on the wrong side
Then I hear a voice in my mind

When I see you running away
It makes me wanna cry
When I see you
Reminding me of the day I had to die

Don’t you know that in My heart I still can feel the pain
'Cause when I see you it’s like killing Me again

A Holy King is returning
It could be any time
He’s coming back for a spotless bride
Not for those who’ve got something they’re trying to hide

This time is sanctified
We drink of the rain and eat the bread
For our iniquities his body was bruised
And for our peace his blood was shed

But we gather not in sorrow
To commemorate ah

That he died to bring us 
Back to the father

What you must realize
Its time to eat the bread
And drink against of 
The bonds was set
That you agree with every word
That's in this eat
And that you embrace the masters hand

But its only to remind you
The law has been fulfilled (ah)
A new covenant abides
And that held is broken
We're trapped no longer inside

So eat the bread
And drink the wine
So we can have
Sweet Communion
He gave his life
Once for all time
So we can have
Sweet Communion

So eat the bread
And drink the wine
So we can have
Sweet Communion
He gave his life
Once for all time
So we can have
Sweet Communion

For I received from the Lord 
What I also pass unto you
The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed
Took bread, and when he had given thanks
He broke it and said,

""This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."" 
In the same way after supper, he took the cup, saying
""This cup is the new covenant in my blood
Do this whenever you drink in remembrance of me
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup
You proclaim the Lord's dad until he comes.",Communion Song,2011

That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

And when I get home after workin' all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am if you wanna play
Well, playin' sounds real good to me

'Cause girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do

Searching high and low, here and there
Wondering if anyone cares
All that you're going through
Who will be there for you

Hard times you've faced
Reminding you of all your mistakes
Is there really a brighter day
When will the drama cease
Will there ever be peace

A love that looks beyond my faults
A love so true
The only love thats meant for you

This love isn't like anything that you've ever known
He has a better love, better love
I know you've probably heard it before
When someone can give you love, affection and more
But this love I offer you will come through for sure
He has a better love, better love

I have been there
Feeling that theres no one to care
Believing that life is so unfair
Thinking they'll never be
Someone thats good to me
So please believe
Open up your heart and receive

Remember what you prayed for
Hold on, please don’t let go in this season
Know that flowers bloom when rain falls
You just hold on

You ask when will this go away
Know that God can feel your pain
Believe He’ll never fall short of His word

No one, no one have so much love for us

His love don't come and go it's unconditional

Who else but Him, He's a constant friend
Even when others turn their backs against
No one, oh no one is always there for us

The GOD we serve will make
His presence known, when you praise,

And merciful and kind
Our GOD has been to us.
Then we know every glory hallelujah

And break the enemy.

You have been my strength in the time of weakness
There's never been a time I couldn't count on You
So I will bless You, oh, Lord, in the midst of the people

Come on somebody, right here, right now
We come to give Your name to glory
Somebody help me
Sisters tell me something, come on

Looked around the week was gone
Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known
That the struggle I had faced wasn't over
Drama won't leave me alone

When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint
My first and the last real defense is to stand and to say

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Join in together like this, like this come on
Sister tell me something else

Turned around I'd made it through
Wasn't sure of how I would but the Lord you knew
That my strength would surely fade but You'd cover
And my joy You would renew

You know the enemy seeks and he roars with his plans to abuse
In the midst of his rage and his lies let us stand on the truth

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what the circumstance
I know my life is in His hands
The storms may come but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say
That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way
But this will be my choice, will be my choice

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether this or that, just don't hold back
Keep your praise flowing

For our iniquities his body was bruised
And for our peace his blood was shed

But we gather not in sorrow
To commemorate ah

That he died to bring us 
Back to the father

What you must realize
Its time to eat the bread
And drink against of 
The bonds was set
That you agree with every word
That's in this eat
And that you embrace the masters hand

But its only to remind you
The law has been fulfilled (ah)
A new covenant abides
And that held is broken
We're trapped no longer inside

What I also pass unto you
The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed
Took bread, and when he had given thanks
He broke it and said,

""This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."" 
In the same way after supper, he took the cup, saying
""This cup is the new covenant in my blood
Do this whenever you drink in remembrance of me

You proclaim the Lord's dad until he comes.",Communion Song,2015
Fred Hartley,"When you come to the end of a perfect day,
And you sit alone with your thought,
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought,
Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart,
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray,
And the dear friends have to part?

Well, this is the end of a perfect day,
Near the end of a journey, too;
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,
With a wish that is kind and true.
For mem'ry has painted this perfect day
With colors that never fade,
And we find at the end of a perfect day
The soul of a friend we've made.",Remember Me,1989

And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2006
Fred Hersch,"Quem acreditou
No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditaçao,2009

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes

And you can do the same thing if you please

Change your ways and repent,

When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

Fred Lind,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you",I'll Never Smile Again,2000
Fred Lind,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2000
Fred Lipsius,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love

Fred Longshaw,"I hate to see
The evening sun go down
I hate to see
The evening sun go down
It makes me think, oh
On my last lone round

Feelin' tomorrow
Like I feel today
Feelin' tomorrow
Like I feel today
I'll pack my dreams
And make my getaway

St. Louis woman
With her diamond rings
Pulls my man around
By her apron strings
Wasn't for powder
And his store-bought hair
The man I love
Wouldn't go nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues
Just as blue as I can be
He's got a heart that's like a
Rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone
So, so far from me",St. Louis Blues,1991
Fred Lowery,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,
Fred Lucas,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific],1992
Fred MacMurray,"Small fry, struttin by the pool room
Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my put down that cigarette
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet
Samll fry, dancin for a penny 
Small fry, countin up how many 
My, my just jlisten here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea
You practice peckin all day long to eome old radio song
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
You better listen to your (maw, pay)
and someday practice the law 
and then you'll be a real success
Ys, small fry, (you) kissed the neighbor's daughter
Small fry, (should) stay in shallow water
Seems I should take you cross my knee
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea
You've got your feet all soakin wet
You'll be the death of me yet
Oh me, oh my, small fry

Fred Martin,"Gather your deeds and your possessions,
Whatever certainty you've known.
Forget your heroes,
You don't really need those last few lessons.

Stand in the open,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

How right they knew that they could hurt you,
And you let them cut you to the bone.
But, God forbid, you allow them to rid you of your virtue.
Forget their laughter,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

Throw down your truth and check your weapons.
Don't look to see if you're alone. 
Just stand your ground,
And don't turn around, whatever happens.
Don't ask directions, 
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear will be your own.",The Next Voice You Hear,2006
