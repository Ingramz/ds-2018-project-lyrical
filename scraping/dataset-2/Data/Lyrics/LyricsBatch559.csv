Ever had a feeling that you can't go on
Trying to be strong but getting weaker
Carrying the weight of every single day
Have you lost your way, feeling defeated

Sat staring, counting spiral patterns on the wall
You wonder if your luck is ever gonna turn around at all

You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're all alone
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high

Your bedroom carpet stained with Rosé wine
Empty's left behind, the morning after
The distant purr of cars on soaking roads
And the street echoes the noise of laughter

The bottom of the bottle, finds you almost every night
You wonder if your life is ever gonna turn out right again

You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Confused and battered by the motion of the changing tides
You're nearing empty and you've barely got the will to fight
You wonder if you're gonna live or if you will survive
Ohhh

You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high

Kodaline,"It's harder to see through the eyes of a stranger
It's easy to love when the world doesn't hate ya
When you tryna send out but nobody hears a word
It's easy to swim when the tide's not against ya

(You've been here before)
I know that you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And giving up is letting go
(Never fight alone)
But you don't have to fight alone

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leaving you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
That I shed a, I shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear
Shed a tear, shed a tear)

And I feel your pain when I know you're in trouble
And I'll take the blame from your hurt in your struggle
And when you tryna speak out but nobody hears a word
I'll be your voice, lay your head on my shoulder

Oh (You've been here before)
I know you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And nothing is impossible
(Never fight alone)
You don't have to fight alone

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

That I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)

And when you're livin' in your darkest hour
And when you're gettin' closer to the ash

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)

Kodaline,"Friday night and no one's home
There's no point getting drunk alone
Grab your coat and make a call
I meet you down in Temple Bar
People come and people go
So raise your glass to who you know
Winter hasn't taken hope
So why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong

Saw a girl that I used to know
It's funny how a heart moves on
She's got a home and a family
I get the feeling she's forgotten me
People leave their mark and go
Like footprints in a winter snow
Winter hasn't taken hope
Why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong",Temple Bar,2018
Kodaline,"The stars in the pavement
Are washed up and jaded
There's blood on the streets of gold
A beautiful waitress
Who just couldn't make it
So far away from home

Are you strong enough? Are you wise enough?
Are you giving up? Will you disappear?
When it comes to me, I don't know you see
I don't want to leave, but I can't stay

Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know

No one can see them
The angels and demons
Are testing how low you'll go
The sunsets and sunsets
As dark as your heart gets
It's best if you just say no

But are you strong enough? Are you wise enough?
Are you giving up? Will you disappear?
When it comes to me, I don't know you see

Reaching for the light

Kodaline,"When we were young we were the ones
The kings and queens oh yeah, we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes man no regrets
Wish I could relive every single word

We've taken different paths
And travelled different roads
I know we'll always end up on the same one when we're old
And when you're in the trenches
And you're under fire I will cover you

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

I've got you brother-er-er-er
I've got you brother-er-er-er

Oh brother, we'll go deeper than the ink
Beneath the skin of our tattoos
Though we don't share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you that's the truth

We're living different lives
Heaven only knows
If we'll make it back With all our fingers and our toes
5 years, 20 years, come back
It will always be the same

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I would give you my lungs so you could breathe

I've got you brother-er-er-er
I've got you brother-er-er-er

And if we hit on troubled water
I'll be the one to keep you warm and safe

Kodaline,"My house, I'm all alone
I got a picture on my telephone of you
This tree will never grow again
Our hearts are dominoes
Tumbleweeds on a desert road somewhere
Our love is coming to an end

And there's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now my mind is moving down the road
It's a new day beginning
But there's a piece of me clinging
To all the memories and episodes

I won't do anything for you
But I want do that again
We might never get closer
Heaven knows it have to end

There's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now I'm looking through another lens
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again

Singing
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

We're drinking lemonade
It taste bitter but we're not a free
To speak our minds so honestly and true
I know when I'm eighty-eight
I'd still remember all the better days
Right now I gotta say goodbye

Tout mon corps devient mou
Overdose d’hormones
Viens t’asseoir sur mes genoux
J’arrêterai de boire

Quand je pourrai plus tenir debout
Dans le club grab le mic freestyle
Crache partout on
Bounce jusqu’au matin
Comme une meute de kangourous
Hé yo! Barman!
J’ai besoin d’une autre broue
Chill comme un eskimo
Assis dans son igloo
Quand je me lève matin
Y’a pas plus marabout
Sur un lendemain de brosse
On dirait que je sors de l’égout
c’est pas tous les jours fête
le travail passe avant tout
y’a un temps pour chaque chose

Koen De Cauter,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,2000

Safely back where you belong

Hey Hey
Heey-heeayy

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
It's bout that time we got the tunes
Hot on the block sippin' on 'yac like some damn fools
Consumin' liquor by the ounce
Ya guys is rollin' up to get their grub on,
wit the dubs on and the car that bounce
Help at the park, barbaques wit roasted pig
And can nobody eat until the meat is done and we feed the kids
Nieces, nephews, uncles and aunties
Yea, you ride wit plenty of folks but ain't got nothin' up on these
Seeds from the weed, up out the bangs of optimos
A bunch of pimps, playas, and hustlaz to fock the hoes
Pros comin' off, when the barbaques done
ain't really focus on that, but hell a playa bound to get some
Kids runnin' back-and-fourth cryin' on who pushed them now
We all fam, but I be damned if they push my seat down
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Hook: be	-12]
M-dub, three thugs sittin' on duece dueces
Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices
barbaques and half-ounce, bounce wit the music
Wide-identical pipes (?) wit dukeys

[Verse 2: Coo Coo Cal]
Midwest is the timezone
When it gets hot,
We go block-to-block, open up shop, and get our grind on
Now I ain't lyin' homes to whoever make a playa change
To release the tension, mention basketball and play a game
Wit dames on the sideline cheerin' you on
And haters that can't play on the side while,
cryin' foul, screwin' you on
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya

A lot of them cut the top, hookin' up decks and sounds to roll to
It ain't the old two-hundred twenty twins

Bendin' corners in an orderly fashion
Twenty cars deep,

Flashin' bread at them chickenhead
Yea they jumpin' in to sin dawg,

Hear what I just said
Pick 'em up in the presidential rento limo, TV's and (?)
Ghetto celeb is the gear we wear
Naw ya'll don't hear it there
But by the end of this year you gonna feel the player
Sippin' on Henn, and Cris is gettin' plenty drunk
Which switches from the candy-coupe dawg, an empty front
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

Lets take a little time
And talk about it

I hope you stay
So we can do our thang

Let's go somewhere and finish
What we started
Cause right from the beginning

You know I felt you rise

Just how deep
Does your lovin' go
So tell your boys ""good night""

Koffee Brown,"One two I remember when we first met 
I fell in love with the sex hickeys on my tities
Bite marks on my neck wifey like next 
But now you get vexed and in the last six months
Seems you lost respect you don't call when you hang out
Ball with the range out act all wild in the mall want to bang out
Shit nigga you don't know who I be
Instead of flippin on me get a J.O.B.

Loud talkin pickin my clothes like a orphan 
And when ever I'm out you be stalkin
911 paging you be callin what so important
Use the bathroom then you come back and say you want to talk
With your hands not washed and the seat up
Get a job and get your ass up and make the bed up yeah

What do you do when your man is a bum
can't keep a job for more than a month
Your friends don't like him and his game is dead
You blew it off with him cause he's good in bed
Take your keys and throw them out
Or just get mad and run your mouth
You work all day he's on the couch
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]
Think I'm about to blackout blackout 
Grabin out wildin out 
Flippin on me I'm flippin on you
Don't want to make me act a fool
Think I'm about to blackout blackout
Grabin out wildin out
don't want to lose my cool
I'm about to blackout on you

Talkin like you got room 
Don't even clean the house
Never seen a broom
Movin my shit don't know where its at
I told you more than once I wasn't havin that
I'm about to blackout got to let it out
Doin crazy things make me want to shout
Blowin up my cell what's that all about
Sayin you was home when I seen you out
I'm havin doubts

Now what do you do when your girls a bird
Pack her shit kick to the curb
Lose your cool catch your case
Sleep wit her friends throw it back in her face
Do ya take her back try again
can't leave home don't trust your friends
Turn your back she'll play you out
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]

Clothes smellin like perfume or makeup 
Call me somebody else when we make love
You trickin my dough at the strip club
You think its a game but I'm gettin fed up
You talkin in codes on your cell phone 
You do it on the low like I ain't gon know
You movin too fast better slow down
You playin me close gonna make me blackout

Yo pluck an independent woman like beyonce
And I could give a damn what you and your boyz say
No need to kick me out I don't want to stay
Pack the coach bags and be on my way I don't need you 
You need a broad that wake up in the morn clean cook and feed you
And that ain't luck nigga that's what's up
Key up the truck and clear the bank account when I blackout

Tell you right now I qualify
Come at me for real, all games aside

Baby just relax, see you don't have to ask, I got niggas flippin' packs
I'll give you finer things, like carats in your ring
I'll take you to the lot, which one you want to cop, the seven or the drop
Just tell me what you need , it ain't about the G's

See money ain't the thing, it ain't about the rings
And those artificial things 'cause all it really brings, is a lot of pain.
What I need is trust, a little bit of lust, so that every time we touch
I feel it in your kiss nothing means more than this

With the platinum on her neck, how you put her in a Lex
Refusing her beggots, I know what she needs
How you couldn't believe she was with another kid
All up in the club, blowing up the spot, all up in the Marriott What?

Anyone could tell, she took me through some hell
Wouldn't even post bail, having you around, I think I finally found
A lover I can feel, someone to keep it real, so baby let's chill
Just let me know you care, we can take it there

And I understand you and you understand me
Whether I'm from Mars and you from Venus
Let's sit on a pear and dip our feet in the sea
And agree that sometimes we disagree ya see

Love, it ain't absolute we know how we do
So the question is moved to the strength of the brew
The power of our kiss is how we get stirred
Love is when the line between me and you gets blurred

And the coffee tastes just right
The perfect amount of sugar and cream
How I like my coffee? Light brown
You know what I mean?

I hear a deep brown voice speaking softly saying
Let's make our coffee sweet and us
Got love like sleeping late on Saturdays
Like slipping into old slippers on Sunday Morning

We got love like French toast and Mondays off
All I need is promises you can keep
I don't need nothing deep
All the fancy things I can give myself

We be all we need, like, like coffee

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Caught up in circles confusion--
Is nothing new
Flashback--warm nights--
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after--

Sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said--
Then you say--go slow--
I fall behind--
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus:]
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting 
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has 
Turned to gray
Watching through windows--you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time--

Hair too long but the skin don't crack

And all I asked was space to breathe tho
My last was yours to take
I needed nothing but my people to understand and over stand

There was always more to see
These towers blocks vision but the ends still feel like home to me

What a damn shame that
You would keep us confined to a little
For your own game, it's a gold game
Played the defense well

As if your never down.

to feel your heart beating fast
and stay there as i whisper
how i loved your peaceful eyes on me
did you ever know that i had mine on you?

Darling so share with me,
your love if you have enough,
your tears if your holding back,
or pain if that's what it is.
How can i let you know?
I'm more than the dress and the voice.
Just reach me out then,
You will know that you are not dreaming.

Darling so there you are!
With that look on your face.
As if your never hurt.
As if your never down.
Shall I be the one for you,
Who pinches you softly but sure?
If frown is shown then,
I will know that you are no dreamer.",Eyes on Me,2000

Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up

Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)

Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches

Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore

Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time

Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'

That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
When ya comin from the eastside, ghetto

Popping collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more

(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-moma's house 
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfucking first telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up cause she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and applause
And I put my hand on my balls and said what's up dog

[Chorus]

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperon plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Top cat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fucking with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt (bitch!)

Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast
(So fast)
Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's
And ask them niggas in the Source Awards
When I caught them while y'all was pacin', the homies
Was bringin' up situations, eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

Shit, I ain't got nothing to say, wit no time to play

When I bust this bitch I put my dick in her mouth

But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga

Yeah, it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist

Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act
I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

Admit 'cause I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it

From Mexico, man I like this ho 
The homey little Tony told me a long time ago

Unless that shit OD like the party's at the Hutch 
What? what? remember double dutch 
Ow, the bubble butch 
All up in the party swangin' E's and C's 
Wit a car full a heat, hope you want my beats

Twenty out a twenty-one I'll leave wit somebody else

And point blank, can't nobody fade my clip 
Don't even thank the trick 
You know what we ain't inta hatin 
But anythin you tryin' to brang we ain't inta takin 
Can't you tell these outfits cost a fortune 
Security stay alert to use enforcement 
Ass cheeks pass me, I grabbed 'em hips 
Dancin through the crowd to a badder bitch 
The gas was quick, but not for mack I spit 
I stopped at Iceland and got this platinum dick 
You can't attract a bitch, my game accurate 
You wanna laugh and trip, I'm out to crack the whip 
I ho that's fast and thick, and ain't gonna ask me shit 
Get a blasted lip, and she attacked the dick

And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out

To mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
Get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice

And me and my fellas up in here like good one pimp, we all won

Trying to have some things
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Oh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

Kokane,"Too Sheezy, (whats up main?)
Playa (for life baby)
You got to go out there 
and handle your business (get my money)
Handle yours, playas play on (bitch)
Nigga that's pimp shit (bitches gonna pay me)
What you say? (Oh these hoes gon' pay me)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (born to mack)
Nothin' but the hog in me (that's what I said)

I was born to mack and at a young age
I knew I'd be a real pimp someday
So I practiced my walk, I studied the game
I never been a sucker but I was still lame
Some things never change but my game elevated
When it comes to pimpin' hoes I been truly educated
Cause I'm so slick, I make hoes turn tricks
Players University, class of '86
And I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho
I was 17 then and now I'm 34
I'ma still be a pimp till the day I die
On every street corner, and every high rise
I got the best women that money can buy
When I talk about the game, I never lie
Ask me why that lil girl made her momma cry
You want to know I'll tell you why, nigga

Nigga that's pimp shit (get that money main)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (that's right)
Nothin' but the hog in me 
(get that money bitch, get that money bitch)

She got lost and turned out at a young age
I knew she'd be a real ho someday
When she was 10, she was freaky back then
She would let the lil' boys rub on her pants
She liked sittin' on a grown mans lap
When she was 14, she let em fuck her from the back
For some scratch, she let em hit
Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit
Lil fine ass bitch, with some big ol' tits
Made her first pimp rich with that good shit
But at the age of 26 she's an old ho
She don't really look that good no mo'
But she could make a trick cum in a minute
Anything you want you can get it
Anything you pay for, she'll earn
Give her some money, she'll take your sperm, nigga

Nigga that's pimp shit (get your money girl, get that money girl)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me bitch)
Niggas that's pimp shit (pimp shit, yea, fa sho)
Nothin' but the hog in me 
(Oh you know pimpin' is the oldest profession)

He used to give the girls his lunch money when he was young
For a kiss on the cheek, he thought it was fun
I knew he'd be a real trick one day
Lettin' girls ride his bike, let 'em win when they play
He was soft, and females made him week
When you got no game, the only way to make a freak
Is to pay em, and that's what he grew up and did
He won't lie, ask him what he do for a bitch
Spend cash, just to get some ass
He tried to marry a ho, but the shit didn't last
He broke the golden rule, I hope he never tried
His own wife, own house, and he still had to die
that's fucked up, but that's the life of a trick
Be a sucker for a bitch and she'll suck your dick
I know he loves her, I don't doubt him
She pulled out his money, said ""I love things about him""

Nigga that's pimp shit (pimp shit)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get that money girl, get ya money bitch)

And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang
PCR, Dogghouse when I bang, and I'm out, nigga

[Chorus]

[Yukmouth]
What? Nigga, ery'thang, ery'thang..
Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Are you real motherfuckers, for real motherfucker?
Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch
I'm somethin you don't wanna fuck wit
I'm the nigga wit the pistol, launchin six from the clip
I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga
Nate, Yuk, Kokane, Kurupt we back nigga
Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit
What up pretty mama, a.k. pretty bitch
This Kurupt, I know you fucks to get rich
I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K
Kurupt, the analytical, phenonomal, the most anticipated
Highly hated, top graded
Ig'nant than a motherfucker, I don't give a fuck

Crushed your flow you got jealous club me for

Undercover ho's be real soft spoken, why would you slash my tire?
And I got stock in Goodyear, bitch I'm all good year
Tryin' to fuck up my clutch so I'm forced to change gears

So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes

I'm feelin' like a throw-away-blue
Like God's first draft of the sky
Balls it up for something new
And if you got somethin' better
Than I'm listenin to you
If you got somethin' better
Than I'm listenin? to you
I let the beat ride
When I'm listenin? to you
I'm through

J-Live

I been
Listenin' to records I've collected
Records I've selected
And inspected
Dissected on examination tables
'Til my technique was perfected
Records that have served and protected
A confidence
In my own perception of the world
Once the wax is reflected
I found myself connected
To the music
Like the lyrics were injected
So now when times are hectic
I close my eyes and listen
To the words
Like advice from somebody
I respected
When I was found dejected
That saying about art and life
Is really just the half
When you recognize
That music is math
Like a true song
Is really just a product
On the answer sheet
Life's craft is a scrap
When you show your work
I would listen with a smirk 
From irony to Irief
From Bob Marley smokin? stones
At the building refused
My girl left me
Roberta Flack said
Never you mind
Love may lose
But at least you tried
The wisdom hit me in the eyes
And I almost cried
Stevie Wonder saw my tears
And put the joy inside
Sade showed me a love
That was stronger than pride
Minnie Rippleton
Invited me to come inside
Marvin Gaye taught me
Lessons of anger and time
That's just the tip of the ice berg
Floatin' in my mind
Not to mention
All the jazz and instrumentals
That's essential
And the Hip-Hop elders
That taught me to rhyme
That's why I'm still listenin'

Kola Rock:

I'm competent with competitions
I'm competitious
I'm compliment my compositions
With lots of pictures
An album full of mental photographs
And sorted similes
Back between the documents
Of dowries and pedigrees
Hip-Hop is like my family
On holidays we bitchin? like
Why you don't freestyle no more!?
I'm better written
I like to place my posture
In a positive position
I like to be the conduit
Controlling my condition
I'm sittin' on the back porch
Thinkin' and I'm listenin'
To the earth spinnin'
To trees rustle
Wind whistlin'
To the grass being crushed
By the feet of small children
Generations of women
Whose end was my beginning
Settling
The foundation of the building
Settling
Of the foundation of self
Knowin' that my best work
Has yet to be written
I'll probably never press it up
To put on the shelf
But when times are rock hard
And money is skin tight
I'll write my love songs 
On the back of my battle rhymes
The question wouldn't be
If I sold my soul
My soul's been sold
The question is:
Was it worth your dime
Listenin'
Listenin' to this
Listenin'
Listenin' to this

Kole,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls

As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing

Und egal was er anstellte, du warst immer auf der Seite von deinem Sohn, Mama
Und ich glaub hätt' ich das als Vater gesehen
Wie mein Sohn für die Schule seit Jahren schon überhaupt nichts mehr macht
Und hätt ich ihn dann auch noch mit Ladungen an Rauschgift ertappt
Dann hätt ich ihm lange schon den gnadenlosen Rausschmiss verpasst
Aber du nicht und es tut mir wahnsinnig Leid
Dass dich wegen mir seit Jahren stets gleich die Panik ergreift

Im Sommer vor zehn Jahren, als wir fast ärmer waren als du es warst
In 'nem Loch lebten, das mehr Baracke war als Wohnung
Statt 'nem Sofa und Betten bloß 3 Matratzen auf dem Boden
Du warst Mamas neuer Freund mit etwas dunkler Hautfarbe
Weshalb die Verwandtschaft meiner Schwester und mir laufend sagte
„Passt auf vor dem Algerier da""
Und erst waren wir zwar harte Feinde, aber du wurdest mehr als ein Vater
Und deiner Heimat fern, bekamst du bald Ärger mit der Staatsgewalt
Wurdest dann eingesperrt in eine Strafanstalt
Wo Wärter dich schon schlagen, falls du kein Schweinefleisch isst
Aber mein Stiefvater ist ein Mann, den so schnell keiner klein kriegt
Und es ist heut' im Grunde wie damals, das Geld ist übelst knapp
Doch du bist selbstgenügsam, hustelst hart und hälst dich über Wasser
So wie Eisschollen in Polarmeeren
Und du hast Recht, ich muss weiß Gott mehr Moral lernen
Deshalb hör' ich im iPod stets Koranverse
Eure Ehe waren paar ziemlich harte Jahre
Doch ich bete, dass ihr euch im Paradies wieder vertragt
Du redest kein perfektes Deutsch
Aber wir würden uns auch taub und stumm verstehen
Du bleibst für alle Ewigkeit mein bester Freund, Sidali

Ey, ich mach mit deim Business Schluss

dann kauf dir bitte Kinokarten fürn Comedyfilm

Mit Butterfly wie'n Schmetterlingskokon

Kuck auf die schimmernden Weißgoldketten
Deine Arme gleichen stark dem Inhalt von Streichholzpäckchen
Deine Freunde kippen sich bei der Barfrau Drinks rein
Machen dann hart auf Pimp, ein
Gezielter Schlag aufs Kinn reicht, sie sind daraufhin leise
Und was ihre Kinder angeht, möchte ich darauf hinweisen
Sie sind daraufhin Waisen
Wer hat’s drauf? Wenn's sein muss engagier ich paar Ostblockstaatler
Die alles wegboxen für ca. 4-5 Flaschen Moskovskaya
Kid, ich bedroh deine sichtlich blassen, Pfadfinderfreunde am Lagerfeuer

Was willst du mit japanischer Kampfkunst machen
Gegen ne germanische Kampfhundstaffel?
Deine Bitch kommt zu meiner Show nur

K zum O, erbarmungslos wie Tschetschenenrebellen
Und deine Ex dreht in Hotels Sexszenen für Geld
Ey erklär mir mal bitte, was sind das hier für Zeiten für Rap?
Keinerlei Action und sogar Vertreter des weiblichen Geschlechts
Werden zum Freestyler, das seh' ich nicht gerne
Denn die Weiber gehör'n in die Nähe von Herden wie Viehtreiber
Egal wo ich bin, egal wohin ich geh, ich seh' nur Kids am Biten
Soweit der Blick reicht, billige Imitatoren mit meinem Style
Kollegah-Kopierapper überall ich habe für sie nur Mitleid, weil
Diese miesen Biter sind albern wie der Sänger von „It's my life""
Raus aus der Muckibude, rein in die Guccischuhe

Sieh dich mal an, du bist ein waschechter Hippie
Sogar deine Eltern sagen zu dir „Wasch dich mal, Hippie!""
Kid, ich traf deine Crew und sieh Bitch, ich schlug sie hart
Nun liegen sie blutig da und sind am kriechen wie Tunikas
Ihr sauft in Bierzelten rum? Ich lauf in Tierpelzen rum
Die hab' ich mir mal irgendwann gekauft für vierstellige Summen
Stell dich nicht dumm und verneige dich bitch, jeder weiß ich bin der Beste
Ich trag' keine weiße Weste, ich trage Weißes in der Weste
Du bist bloß Pimp in deinem Kuhdorf
Wo man der King ist schon als Schulsportschwänzer

Kollegah,"Ya Kollegah Truestory Yeah 2004
Adrenalin wenn ich den vollgetankten Wagen auf Hollands Straßen
Vorbei an den Zollbeamten fahre nach Koblenz
Ramme dort an der Ampel einen BMW, begehe Fahrerflucht trete das Gaspedal durch
Denn ich brachte 3 Kilo White Widdow über die Grenze drüber
Rase davon, biege ab, parke im Hinterhof der Kelmendi Brüder
Höre die Polizeisirenen, warte dann einige Stunden ab
Bin nervös, fahr' weiter im Dunkel der Nacht
Denn jeden Tag wollen die Kiffer mich sehen
Denn sie wissen ich mache stets korrekten Kurs wie ein Schiffskapitän
Ticke täglich das Dope an die Jugend
Und werde dauernd abgehört als hätte ich chronischen Husten
Dieses Hustlerdasein ist unheimlich stressig so wie Geisterschlösser
Und zieht ein' des Öfteren runter so wie Treibsandlöcher
Doch ich mach' weiter, weil die Sucht nach Geld mich antreibt
Und ich kann nur hoffen, dass mein Schutzengel mir treu bleibt",Dealer (Prelude),2007
Kollegah,"Und auch in den härtesten Zeiten, kennt er keine Verzweiflung
Denn er ist der Einzelkämpfer
Gibt bei Stress niemals auf, ballt fest seine Faust
Sein Schicksal ist vorbestimmt und er macht das Beste daraus

Und auch in den härtesten Zeiten, kennt er keine Verzweiflung
Denn er ist der Einzelkämpfer
Und er weiß nicht was kommt, und was das Leben ihm noch bringt
Doch er weiß er kämpft bis Gott seine Seele zu sich nimmt

Und er denkt „ey, verdammt ist dieses Leben 'ne Bitch“
Weil er im Elend sitzt, und scheinbar jeder gegen ihn ist
Doch er bleibt stehen und ist der der die Faust ballt wie Fighter
Und auch falls nicht einer an ihn glaubt macht er weiter
Auch wenn tausend Neider ihn klein kriegen wollen
Ihm sein Erfolg nicht gönnen, ihn bloß scheitern sehen wollen
Er verteidigt sein Stolz, mit aller Kraft bis zum Ende
Keiner schafft's ihn zu bremsen, weil er gemacht ist zum Kämpfen
Und im Zweifelsfall allein gegen alle
Der Weg ist steinig, doch kein Stein bringt ihn so einfach zum Fallen
Es kommen Zeiten, wo mal, das Geld nicht reicht
Doch er verfällt nicht gleich, in Selbstmitleid
Nein, denn es geht im Leben hoch und down
Und er steht vom Boden auf, mit stets erhobenem Haupt
Gibt nie auf, denn Gott hilft dem wieder nach oben
Der auch bei stärkstem Regen auf den Regenbogen vertraut

Und auch in den härtesten Zeiten, kennt er keine Verzweiflung

Und er weiß nicht was kommt, und was das Leben ihm noch bringt
Doch er weiß er kämpft bis Gott seine Seele zu sich nimmt

Es ist ermüdend, wenn bei Auftritten in Großstädten und Käffern
Hater kommen, die denken ""lass uns den mal totstechen mit Messern""
Diesen hochnäsigen Rapper und so erinnert die Narbe
Ihn immer daran, dass er sein Auge mal fast verloren hätte
Und deshalb denkt er manchmal ""ey ich hör einfach auf mit Rap""
""Dieser Neid und die Morddrohung, wozu brauch ich diesen Stress?""
Man kann eh kaum verdienen mit Rap
Ich geb dem Volk nur eben diesen Klassiker mit auf den Weg
Und dann bin ich auch schon wieder weg
Aber dann besinnt er sich darauf er ist der Mack
Kuckt in den Spiegel und schreit laut ""Jetzt erst Recht!""
Geht raus schreit ""Wer will Stress?""
Denn er gab noch nie auf noch nicht mal damals
Als es nur Schlägerein jeden Tag gab zu Haus und er verklagt wurde auf
Riesige Geldsummen, wegen gefälschter Markenkleidung
Und 20 Mille verlor, nach 'nem Einbruch
Bei ihm daheim und er pleite war, aber weiter kämpfte
Nein nichts kriegt den Einzelkämpfer klein!

Und Du bist lediglich ein Großmaul wie ein Pelikan
Ich trage Kleider von ganz großen Stardesignern
Bin kein Astronaut, aber mein Anzug ist maßgeschneidert
Wenn ich dreist durch die Hood stolzier'
Du schreist kurz und guckst schockiert drein
Und ergreifst nun die Flucht vor mir
Rennst panisch weg um die nächste Straßenecke
Und zwar in 'nem Affenzahn, wie Bananenreste
Ich trag Armaniweste, aufwändig bestickt
Bin in Faustkämpfe verwickelt wie ausländische Kids
Während Opfer sich verneigen
Denn ich durchschreite den Block auf bossartige Weise
Wie osmanische Kaiser
Ey ich brauch' langsam mal 'ne Villa plus Pool
Silberne Uhren, Kid ey, ich bin zwar gebildet und klug
Besuche Kunstgalerien
Aber mit mir ist trotz dessen nicht gut Kirschen essen wie mit Obstallergien

Ich steh' nämlich auf Knarren, so wie das Walter Emblem, Bitch!
Baller' gelegentlich mit einem Colt in Richtung
Von Streifenpolizisten und Kugeln streifen Polizisten
Und jetzt hör' auf mich anzubeten
Und laufend anzuflehen, Dir ein Autogramm zu geben
Oder der Boss betritt Dein Treppenhaus und boxt Dich in die Fresse
Und Du liegst am Ende des Ganges wie ostindische Städte
Mein Herz gleicht einem Block aus Granit
Der Feind kommt, ich thaibox seinen Kopf auf Granit
Ne halbe Line allerfeinster Stoff aus Paris
Und ich schlender dann elegant über den Bossaura-Beat
Wie Magie, und wie wollt Ihr mich hier aufhalten?
Ihr dürft Euer Maul halten, mir die Tür aufhalten
Denn ich betrete den Deutschrap-Drecksladen und räum' auf
Akzeptable Rapper sind hier wie Stecknadeln im Heuhaufen
Und ich übernehme nun im Alleingang die Rapszene
Keiner kriegt mich jemals klein als wär ich Tschetschene
Bleibe der legendäre unerreichte Punchlinekönig
Angsteinflößend färbt sich nach 'nem Punch gleich schön der Randstein rötlich
Ey das ist Kokainmusik
Höre die CD samstagabends und Du kannst Dir sparen Kokain zu ziehen

War lange Zeit stets mit einem Bein im Bau wie ein verkrüppelter Dachs
Wurde leider Gottes irgendwann dann von den Bullen erwischt und danach vor Gericht geladen
Und hatte dann nicht mehr nur 'ne goldene Kette am Hals sondern auch ein Gerichtsverfahren
Yeah doch egal ich bin back, du siehst mich im Club mit mehreren Ketten

Deshalb jetzt mal ein Hoch auf mich als wär' ich eine Wetterkarte
Ich habe schon damals als kleiner Racker
Den meisten Teil meiner Zeit verbracht 
Mit Scheine machen, aber das meiste davon wurde verspielt so wie kleine Katzen
Ich lenk' den Benz Richtung Selfmade-Studio
Komme, chille, berappe die Beats
Trage Sonnenbrille und scheffel den Kies
Bin von Bonzenviertel bis Ghetto beliebt
Ey, die Hustlerikone vom Selfmade-Label
Deine Leute sagen ich sei abgehoben so wie Geldbeträge
Denn ich führe statt mit Fachidioten nur noch Selbstgespräche
Und sogar die arrogantesten von allen Bitches
Werden in der Nähe vom Überboss zur Groupienutte
Denn Kollegah ist nunmal ein Bild von einem Mann wie ein Van Gogh Selbstporträt
Yeah, und egal ob auf Volksfesten, im Kindergarten oder auf Bolzplätzen
Schon damals in den Kindesjahren konnte man Kollegah nie rumlaufen sehen ohne die Goldkette
Deine Freunde sahen noch keinen Rapper so eine Kette tragen
Und sind deshalb auf einmal so klein mit Hut wie der Sohn eines Mexikaners

Also was du Punk? Schweig, Machomannstyle
Tritt aufs gas, fick drauf was der Tacho anzeigt
Wenn man uns durch die Straßen cruisen sieht
Gibt’s gemurmel wie beim Glaskugeln spielen",Machomannstyle,2007
Kollegah,"Alphagene, das Album ist vorbei
Falls du weinst, sei dir versichert, ich kehr bald schon wieder heim
Eindrucksvoll wie Meteoriteneinschlag
Ey der selten telefonisch erreichbare Zeremonienmeister
Sah wie das Volk nach diesem Rapklassiker
Verlangte wie Menschen nach Nahrung in Westafrika
Und wenn der absolute Straßenchef back ist
Steht ihr Spastis nur stumm da und lächelt nett wie im Wachsfigurenkabinett
Spast ich mach es kurz
Ich hatte in meinen Hustlerzeiten meistens in den Jackentaschen Haschischplattenspuren
Trotzdem hab ich Abitur
Denn egal was ich mach, ich mach dabei ne fantastische Figur, wie'n plastischer Chirurg
Der Pimp im Mercedes, Ey ich bin ähnlich wie dieser Stephen King
Denn ich drehte Dinger mit E's
Hing in der Regel täglich im Kaffee mit Türken und ließ Straßendeals
über die Bühne gehen als würden sie Theater spielen
Ich durchschreite wie Volkshelden die Hood
Mit goldgelbem Schmuck auf der stolzgeschwellten Brust
Und deine Freunde, die sich abends in den Straßen der Innenstand treffen
Sind am Betteln und hängen an der Nadel wie Pinnwandzettel
Ich fahr im bildschönen Ferrari rum
Du chillst gewöhnlich abends vor deinem Schildkrötenterrarium
Und giltst als armer Junge, der mit dem Euphemismus etwas beleibt
Sein Drecksdasein als Fettsack umschreibt
Ey der Boss streckt reichlich Speed mit Kopfschmerztabletten
Geht es dann an Kids verteilen wie Bibi Blocksberg Kassetten
Während laufend die Frauen diesen pelzetragenden
Aufstrebenden Selfmadestar Honig ums maul schmieren wie in Wellness-Farm
Kaum zu glauben, aber selbst K zum O
Zum Doppel, L wurde damals mal abgezogen wie Robbenfell
Während seiner Anfangstage
Später zog er gerne mal so mancher Dame den Ring ab als wäre sie eine Handgranate
Du sitzt Samstagsabends mit unerfreutem blick rum
Und kriegste Rumgekeuche mit, denn ich bumse heut die Bitch
Die du deine kleine Schwester nennst
Und erzeuge mit meinem ungeheuren dick bei ihr den Jungfernhäutchenriss
Ich hab Groupiehoes und lege fast jede nacht
Dubios im Studio die Ladys flach, wie Julio- Iqlesias
Sehe nachts die Straßenkinder hustlen
In den Nebengassen die von Regen nass sind sowie Badezimmerkacheln
Kid, schluss mit lustig, Pussy renn weg
Oder du kriegst n Schuss in den Head wie bei russisch Roulette
Ich trage ne schussichere Weste unter dem kuschelweichen Pelz
Und sie ist Bulletproof wie diese Schwuchtel bei D12
Guck ich mach mein Geld nicht mehr durch Rauschgifthandel denn
Ich verkauf die Platten endlich 10000-fach an die Fans
Du hast ne feminine Ader wie ein Frauenhandgelenk
Während man die Clowns in deiner jämmerlichen kaum bekannten gang
Allesamt bloß mit Tretern mit Adidaslogo sehen kann
Kommt Kollegah elegant mit Stiefeln aus Alligatorenleder
Geh die Bodyguards holen, ich geh ab wie inner Gladiatorenarena
Und Gegner krabbeln herrum, wie ein Laminatbodenverleger
Ich seh Amilandklone an jeder Raplandschaftsecke
Erschreckende Anzahlen lächerlicher Drecksstandardrapper
Die jetzt langsam checken, dass sie gegen den bosspullovertragenden pimp
In hoffnungsloser Lage sind wie Kosovo Albanien
Und lieber wegrennen, denn der speedvercheckende, knochenharte, kieferbrechende
Boss ist da, viel versprechend wie Stotterer
Sieh, auch wenn du Opfer zwar nicht auf Schornsteinen hockst
Hast du Vorzeigetrottel trotz dessen Storchbeine wie Scott
Ey die in second hand umherrennenden Member deiner Ghettogang
Werden bespuckt wie Method Man - Konzertgänger
Wenn ich back bin werden leuchtende Feuerwerke explodieren
Und deutscher Rap wird dann erneut gänzlich neu definiert

Von mir, Kollegah dem Boss, yeah, das wars
Bis bald meine Freunde, wir sehen uns",Outro,2007

Dank Kollegah schmeißen Teenager E-Pillen ein, 
Legen jedes zweite Weekend auf CD-Hüllen Lines
Geh und verneige dein Antlitz nun vor dem weltbesten Doubletimerapper
Der selbst wenn fantastisches Wetter ist Pelz trägt wie Chewbaccadarsteller
Ey ich schreib „Selfmade"" über dein' Rocawearsweater, denn du bist ein Fan von uns
Kennst von uns alle Tracks und rapst sie jedes Mal Wort für Wort mit auf Jams von uns
Ey ich sitz im Benz und wenn du mir um Autogramme bettelnd den Notizblock zuschiebst
Dann macht das leider nur wenig Sinn, denn Kollegah nimmt in der Regel keinerlei Notiz von Groupies
Schon wieder isses Dopetickerbusiness, Rapsound ich streck auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Komm mit dem Blaue-Augen-Chromsilberblick in den Club
Aufsehnerregend wie ne Mondfinsternis
Stillschweigend stehen deine Leute da, denn ich steig aus dem silbernen Mercedes
Filmreife Szenen, herausragend wie bei Wildschweinen die Zähne
Kollegah ist autoritär, und du wärst gerne auch so wie er
Genau so wie er, auch so ein Player, doch bist Southpolejeansträger
Und spielst leider nur eine untergeordnete Rolle wie in Hauptschulen die Lehrer
Breite Schultern, weißes Pulver, tütchenweise abgepackt, bitch
Der Typ, der keinen motherfuck gibt
Steht für Cadillacs, Ice, Heavyweight, Style
Starker Tobak, da wird sogar Mary J bleich

Bitch, ich wahre mein Pokerface bis ich sterbe

Der Pokerfaceking hat sich mit diesem Meisterstück persönlich
Selbst feierlich gekrönt als bester größter Rapper
Und sitzt jetzt mit Reichsapfel und Königszepter
Kaiserlich wie Römerchefs da auf seinem Ahornblattthron herum
Von Ratten umgeben wie'n Laboratorium
K zum O, Hardcoreflow, Penner kuck ich geh Punkt 2
In den Club und ab halb 3 wird deine Frau nie wieder an ihrem G-Punkt zweifeln
Dein Portemonnaie voll Scheine gehört jetzt mir und Fav
Und wir machen Fifty Fifty so wie Curtis Jackson Fans auf Curtis Jackson Jams
Ey der Pokerfaceking ist im glänzenden Sportwagen
Mit Gangstern am Vorfahren wie Gefängnistransportwagen
Und lenkt dann den Sportwagen
Routiniert durch die Straßen von deiner Hood und ist von Fans umgeben wie'n
Englischer Vorgarten Kid, ey ihr lasst gerne mal öfters den gangster raushängen
Ey ich lass gerne mal öfters aus geöffnetem Fenster Möchtegerngangster raushängen
Also mach bitte nicht auf Ganove und Halunke, denn du hängst in deiner Wohnung
Ab mit Kumpels und ziehst dir die Prinzen rein so wie das Rapunzel

Du dummer Bengel glaubst ich verticke dir Crackrocks
aber das sind nur Kalksteine, Clown
Ihr bettelt bei dem Mack um Rapfeatures
macht in den Texten und Raps auf Crackdealer, doch seid
Im Endeffekt bloß ein recht biederer kleiner
jämmerlich weinender Messdienerverein
Renn besser davon oder verstecke dich in Katakomben
guck ey deine Freundin ist ne fettleibige Bitch
Die mitten im Dreck des Redlight Districts jeden Tag an der Crackpipe sitzt
Ich habe das Speed, versorg an Bahnhöfen Dealer
Mache Straßenmusik so wie Panflötenspieler, bei mir wurde schon im Kindesalter
Pimpverhalten großgeschrieben und das nicht nur im Rechtschreibtest
Ich komme mit glänzender Armbanduhr und einigen Bangern mit Kahlrasur
Fahre den Mercedes, gebe Gas 
und alle andern Autofahrer lenken sofort auf die rechte Fahrbahnspur
Ich komme dann an in deiner Stadt
betätige die quietschende Bremse und steig aus dem Benz
Du zögerst keinen Moment, nimmst reißaus und rennst
Denn wenn ich in deine Villa komme 
und deine Verwandten, diese relativ harmlosen Opfer
Routiniert mit einem Schlagstock geboxt hab
sind sie allesamt zahnlose Opfer
Kid, ich gebe dir den Befehl
geh die CD von Kollegah Minimum 5 mal holen, du Opfer
Denn ich will endlich Gold gehen wie dieser Star Wars-Roboter

Ich war ein niemand, aber schau mich jetzt an: Lebende Legende
Ey mir geht es trotz aufgesetzter Ray Ban-Brille blendend
Showtime, Bitch, wenn dein mädchenhafter, 
schwacher Body nach nem eleganten Uppercut
Auf ähnliche Art wie nasser Sack, 
platschend auf den regennassen Asphalt klatscht
Geb' ich keinen motherfuck auf Rippenbrüche, 
sieh wie ich auf deiner Stirn Kippen zerdrücke
Kid ich bin der Mack und ich verbringe mindestens 80 Tage im Jahr an der Mittelmeerküste
Bleib bis in alle Zeit ein herzensloser
sehr viel Dope tickender Erdbewohner
Eure Ghettostories wirken in etwa so überzeugend wie das dumme Geschwafel einer Märchenoma
Wer will kokaartige Adrenalinschübe, warte ich habe die Garantie
Baller dir wahnsinnige Passagen in rasendem Speed an den Kopf auf erhabenen Hammerbeats
Ich bin im Club und du muckst auf, fängst an herumzuzappeln wie in nem Kung Fu-Film
Aber Nutte was bringen dir deine Kung Fu-Skills
Wenn du nur wild in der Luft rumfuchtelst
Verbeug dich mal lieber, sonst kann es sein, dass heut' Nacht dein Kiefer zerbricht

Nutten die ständig Teile schmeißen wie frustrierte Puzzlefans
Ich tauch' auf in der Stretchlimo, das Pep und Coke-streckende Sexsymbol
Etliche Hoes sind mit auf mich setzen beschäftigt wie im Wettbüro
Kid ich komme zu dir sage 
„Gib mir sofort alle deine Kohle"" und solltest du widersprechen
Werd ich dir mit einem Ellenbogenschlag 
in weniger als einer Millisekunde den Kiefer brechen
Und hinterlasse danach deinen Körper mitten auf der Straße von deinem Viertel vollkommen
Misshandelt übersät, mit unzähligen 
Brandwunden von tausenden auf deiner Haut ausgedrückten Zigaretten
Der King aller Doubletimer
keiner dieser Wannabes im Game ist in der Lage das zu überbieten
Nutte, wenn ich komme klettern deine Leute 
sofort ohne Zögern in die Wipfel der Bäume so wie Orang Utans
Denn sie wissen Kollegah der Mack ist unberechenbar 
und macht in aller Regel immer kurzen Prozess
Mit allen Neidern, die nur hinter seinem Rücken labern 
können und befördert sie mit einem Punch in den Komazustand
Ich lege meinen Anorak ab
zeige dadurch meinen stählernen Body und deine Kifferfreunde
Geraten in Panik, nehmen sofort die Flucht auf 
und sind über alle Berge so wie Gipfelkreuze
Motherfucker diese elenden Bitches heulen

Gegen 20 fette Ochsen auf der Tanzfläche boxen

Da meine Haare etwas heller sind
Und mein Name nicht nach Gangster klingt
Zwar habe ich weit mehr vertickt als sie alle zusammen
Doch darum geht's nicht, damit geb ich nicht an, es ist eh haram
Es geht im Leben nur darum hast du Eier oder nicht
Also laber nicht hinter'm Rücken, sag's mir einfach ins Gesicht

Gesehen ey du bist ja voll der Star, Alter!

Schon lange vor Rap begann K zu dem O mit dem Verkauf von Aufputschmitteln
Und immer mehr Leute begannen dann bald jeden Tag an unserem Haus zu klingeln

War entsetzt denn sie fand irgendwo versteckt in der Bettschublade Dope
Zu der Zeit interessierte ich mich für deutschen Rap nen feuchten Dreck
Andere gingen auf Jams, Kollegah dagegen verteilte an die Leute Pep
Aber entdeckte dann irgendwann sein Talent und wurde vom Hobbyreimer
Binnen 2 Jahren zum Star - Yeah, Bilderbuchkarriere wie Comiczeichner

Doch es ist wie Bumerangwerfen, die krummen Dinger
Die man dreht, kommen irgendwann auf einen zurück
Sieben Jahre war nie was, ich setzte das Dope an meine Kunden ab
Während die Polizei im Dunkeln tappte so wie bei nem Tunnelschacht
Mit 17 Jahren habe ich auf Kilobasis Gras getickt
Geriet schon relativ früh auf die schiefe Bahn wie Martin Schmitt
Und brachte lange bevor ich mit den äußerst harten Punchlines glänzte
Ladungen Ware von den Niederlanden nach Deutschland über die Frankreichgrenze
Und begann dann irgendwann nebenbei mit Rap und der Hype wurde groß
Aber Kollegah sagte nur „scheiß drauf"" und verteilte weiter das Dope
Und hat sich dann mit Yayo und Speed busten lassen auf dem Weg zum Deal
Bekam Bewährung und ne Geldstrafe, die sich gewaschen hat wie Hygienefreaks
Yeah, anfang '07 und Kollegah beschloss an diesem Tag dieses Kapitel ein für alle Mal zu schließen

Wozu heuchlerisch sein, das ist die männliche Natur
Ich verleih im Bett kein‘ Oscar, doch gebe ne glänzende Figur ab

Du dicksaugender kleiner Wicht kriegst Frauen nur als Thailandtourist
Neider sehn mich mit ungewöhnlich viel Money
Ey wenn sie sehn, wieviel Geld mir ungefähr gehört
Dann sagen sie „Hut ab!“, wie Frisöre zu Rabbis
Nachdem sie kurz stutzen, wie ein Bundeswehrfrisör

Yeah, sieh wie ich massenweise Zaster schmeiße
Flatternde Scheine regnen herab auf Pflastersteine
Hustlerstyle, ich ernte neidische Blicke
Denn 20-Zoll-Felgen sind am Reifen, wie Früchte

Trink ne Tasse Kaffee, schick deine Ho wieder zu dir
O.G.s salutier'n, wenn ich durch mein Wohngebiet patroullier
Und ich winke zurück auf arrogante Art und Weise
Mit der Handaußenseite wie Papst Johannes Paul II
Ein heißer Tag, knappe 31 Grad im Schatten
Ich höre Sirenen, bieg in eine Seitenstraße ab
Fahr weiter, komm an ne Ampel, heißester Sommer seit langem
Verschwitzte Kids erfrischen sich an einem off’nen Hydranten
Und sie wissen, es ist der Boss, ein Mann von Welt

Es ist der erste des Monats, der Kontostand stimmt
Sonne am Himmel, ich geh raus, verteile Bonbons an Kids
Hör dabei 2Pac auf ei'm Ohr
Im MP3-Player, spiel mit den Jungs ne Runde Fußball auf ein Tor
Nehm 'nen Schluck aus der eiskalten Wasserflasche
Steig auf die Dachterrasse, schneide die Haschischplatten
Klein und verpack sie dann in einigen Plastiktaschen
Und lass sie dann, um nicht als einsamer Knastinsasse
Zu enden, von paar Laufburschen verteilen
Geh durch die Hausflure ins Freie, in der Einfahrt die Karre waschen
Sonnenstrahlen spiegeln sich im silberfarbnen Schmuck
Die milde Abendluft ist voller Grillpartyduft
In jedem zweiten Vorgarten Barbecues
In den Ortschaftsstraßen cruisen Sportwagen-Cabrios

Eine sternklare Nacht legt sich über das Villenviertel
Die brütende Hitze wird im kühlen Wind verwirbelt
Überall Grillenzirpen, die Lichter der Stadt schimmern
Im Pool im Garten sind die Bitches am Nacktschwimmen
Ich zieh an der Zigarre, den Blick in den Nachthimmel
Denk an alte Kollegen, die inzwischen im Knast sitzen
Sehe zu, wie sich der Havannarauch verflüchtigt
Hol schließlich noch nen weiteren Champagner aus der Küche
Gehe zum Kühlschrank, greif mir paar Flaschen, prüf
Das Eis im Champagnerkühler, eil zur Terrassentür

Vor den Spiegel stellen, wo sie sich dann meist ziemlich entstellen
Denn die Make-up-Schicht
Auf ihr'm Antlitz ist mehrere Zentimeter dick wie ein Tennisschlägergriff

Die mit ihrer Handycam paar Pics machen

Mir und letztlich hast DU mich erst zu dem Rapding ermutigt
Und ich denke zurück, an ein' besonderen Aben
Zu zweit, den folgenden Tag, die weitren Wochen danach:
Du warst ein gutes Mädchen, nie mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt
Alle sagten, du verdientest etwas bessres als mich
dann hat mich dein Vater mit diesem Päckchen erwischt
Doch du bist bei mir geblieben, und der Rest ist Geschichte:
Aus dem lebenden Beweis für das schwache Geschlecht, der aus
Nem Mangel an Selbstvertrauen und Abwehrreflex heraus
Vor allem davonlief, wurde ein anderer Mensch im Lauf
Der Zeit, mein Mädchen, eine waschechte Gangsterbraut
Ich wusste, es gibt keinen, der uns jetzt noch hält
Bonnie und Clyde, es war wir zwei gegen den Rest der Welt
Du warst meine große Liebe, ich war deine große Liebe
Yeah, was konnte uns beiden schon passieren?

Wir wollten stets
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand wie ne Schlagbohrmaschine
Heut hab ich Bravo-Artikel, wie das Aggro Berlin-Camp
Lass dich stundenlang mit Badeölen und Gurkenmasken in Spa verwöhnen
Denn ich weiß, du hast mit mir mehr durchgemacht als Partylöwen
Und ja, ich weiß, es bedrückt dich
Wenn du auf die vergangenen harten Zeiten zurückblickst
Wir war'n nicht reich, aber glücklich
Uns blieb nicht so viel am Monatsende
Doch wir war'n Improvisationstalente
Und machten hin und wieder Dope-Geschäfte
Und machten hin und wieder Dope-Geschäfte
Dann kam Zuhältertape 1, ich wurd bei Selfmade gesignt
Auf Tour, mit Groupies im Backstagebereich
Du liegst im Bett, schläfst nich ein, ich bin auf Aftershowpartys
Komm Tage später nach Haus, mit nem Paar Manolo Blahniks
Und inzwischen begegne
Ich dir häufiger in irgendnem Bericht in den Medien als im richtigen Leben
Du weißt, es ist nicht mein Style, über Gefühle zu schreiben
Doch du sollst wissen, ich vermisse diese früheren Zeiten, Baby

Doch er geht vorüber, so wie Schaufensterbummler
Ich schau auf, es wird dunkler, langsam nähert sich die Nacht
Ich nehm im Mercedescockpit Platz, Regentropfen prasseln
Auf die Windschutzscheibe, Sintflutstyle, ich schalte die Scheibenwischer
Und das Radio ein, sie melden, bald gibt es ein Gewitter
Es wird kalt, ich bin leicht am zittern, bieg ab in ’ne Nebenstraße
Es ist Herbst… der Glanz der Welt verblasst hinter Nebelschwaden
Und
solang wir auf dieser Welt sind, 
führn wir den Kampf mit uns selbst
Denn wir müssen in den Himmel kommen, 
lassen uns nicht blenden vom vergänglichen Glanz dieser Welt

Und ich schlender durch den Park, Zigarette hinterm Ohr
Die Sonne küsst den Horizont, es ist Herbst
Der Glanz dieser Welt geht vorüber, nichts bleibt uns über
Wenn wir sterben so wie Blätter im Herbst

(und ich muss in den Himmel kommen
Denn was sind 70 Jahre Lebenszeit verglichen mit der Ewigkeit?
Wozu Geld und Autos, wenn am Ende nur die Seele bleibt?)

Und solang' wir auf dieser Welt sind, 
führen wir den Kampf mit uns selbst
Denn wir müssen in den Himmel kommen, 
lassen uns nicht blenden vom vergänglichen Glanz dieser Welt

Und ich schlender durch den Park, Zigarette hinterm Ohr
Die Sonne küsst den Horizont, es ist Herbst
Der Glanz dieser Welt geht vorüber, nichts bleibt uns über
Wenn wir sterben so wie Blätter im Herbst",Herbst,2008
Kollegah,"Ich verlass das Gelände, jetzt ist Sense
Es ist Kollegah, der King in der Hood
Ey ich bin stilvoll gekleidet, ihr hässlich
Blauer Zigarrendunst liegt in der Luft
Und vom Frühling bis zum Winter ist er in der Hood
Der King in der Hood, Kollegah, ich bin die Hood
ey und die Hater kucken, denn
Ich durchkämm im Playerlock der Neighbourhood im Benz

Ich steh auf, will mich anziehen, bin 'ne zeitlang am grübeln
Bei all den Designeranzügen hinter den Kleiderschranktüren
entscheid mich dann für den dunkelgrauen Armanisuit
Durchlaufe die Straßen, pusste blauen Zigerettendunst
In die lauwarme Abendluft, seh ein paar deiner Leute
Und greif sie an, wie das Kokain meine Nasenschleimhäute
Wenn der kanadische Deutsche Boss vor dir steht, schluckst du hörbar
Und stammelst „Wow, was für ein Muskolöser Luxuskörper!7
dein Homie will mich featuren
Ich antworte mit 9mm, wie Guerillakrieger
Und wenn Gerichtsmediziner dann sein Torso untersuchen
Stoßen sie auf Kugeln so wie Billiardspieler
Ich fahr vor dem Schein des Monds, schieß deine Dorfgemeinde tot
Und du willst Hilfe hollen mit SOS-Morsezeichencodes
Du hast das Borderline-Syndrom
Ey komm in meiner Hood zum stehen 
und du bist sofort die Reifen los, wie ein Formel-1-Pilot

Ich verlass das Gelände, jetzt ist Sense

ey und die Hater kucken, denn
Ich durchkämm im Playerlock der Neighbourhood im Benz

Ey ich hab den Wandschrank voll H, Pumpguns und AK´s
Benutze beim Bankdrücken statt langhanteln Playmates
Werd ganztags Plagegeistern
Nach Autogramm gefragt, dich nimmt man derweil meist nur am Rand wahr wie Bademeister
und besser du wechselst zur anderen Straßenseite
Da ich Guns trag im maßgeschneiderten Anzug mit Nadelstreifen
Besser geh bei Seite, mois, beizeiten, Mois!
Sonst heißt´s eingedeuscht „Sag Hallo zu meinen kleinen Freund!“
Und ich mach Klick-Klick mit der gun
Ey komm ich in die Hood, kündigen die Nachrichten Blitzlichtgewitter an
Und zu Promozwecken
Zeig ich Fotografen meine, Schokoladenseite wie Naomi Campbell
Johnny, ey du siehst den großartigen Stoffverteiler
Koksnasen an Snobs verteil´n auf hochadligen Hochzeitsfeiern
er macht dort Hoes klar, mit bordeauxfarbenen Cocktailkleidern
Danach Widmet er sich dem K.O.-Schlagen von Boxweltmeistern

Und er ist in der Hood, Kollegah der King der Hood
Egal ob bei tropischen Temparaturen oder bei Winterluft
Halt dich im Hintergrund
Wenn er die Hood im Mercedes durchkämmt oder er zieht die Gun und macht kurz mal den Abzugsfinger krumm
Ey komm ich in dein Dorf, im mattschwarzen Porsche, hüpfen
Deine im Garten grillenden Nachbarn in Dornenbüsche
Denn die Anlage macht mehr Krach als 'ne Horde Büffel
(Denn) die Boxen haben mehr Watt als die Nordseeküste",In Der Hood,2008
Kollegah,"Ey, Playerhater guck, der Überpimp ist back
Lässt die Bitches laufen im Japaner-Schülerinnen-Dress
Und bitte rede nicht, die Uhr und der Ferrari seien Luxusgüter
Ich zeig dir den Wert in Bar wie ein Luftdruckprüfer
Betätige den elektrischen Fensterheber des Cadillac Escalade,
Fahr shoppen mit 'ner pechschwarzen American-Express-Magnetcard
Und schaue nicht auf Preis- und Sonderausstattungspakete
Sondern auf Handschuhfachgröße und Kofferraumfassungsvermögen
Yeah, während vor meinem Haus mit Kameras in Rosenbüschen
Schlampen abends Fotos knipsend spannen so wie Bogenschützen
Ticke ich gelbe Paste aus Amphetamin-Drogenküchen
An Junkies auf dem Schorestrich und manchmal auch an Modepüppchen
Große blonde Mädels, in der Modebranche tätig
Und grad frisch vom Catwalk kommend so wie Pfotenspuren im Schnee
Ich lass den Pit Bull Terrier los
Und du liegst wie Diskuswerfer fix und fertig
Halbtot mit Meniskuszerrung am Boden!

Ey ich komme in deine Gegend, Leute weinen Tränen
Es ist Kollegah der Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Ich komm mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich
Räubereien täglich Euroscheine zählen
Das ist Kokamusik, der totale Krieg
Du sitzt lieber bei dein' Eltern auf dem Sofa und liest
Denn dir ist sowas zu viel
Ey das ist kein Battlerap,
Das ist Messerstecher-Stresserrap, Kokamusik (Kokamusik)

Yeah, ey ich stemme Kilos auf Hantelbänken
Überquer mit Kilos die Landesgrenzen
Höre wie mein Rufton klingelt
Es ist deine Mum, ich drücke sie weg, als wär es Sumo-Ringen

Und schaff' mein Geld in die Schweiz, vorbei an der Steuer
Amsterdam ist meine zweite Heimat nach Deutschland
Und ich bring wieder weiße Weihnacht nach Deutschland
Was Hustler, Mois, du bist Fleischereifachverkäufer
Playerhater renn, das ist Selfmade
Ich erniedrige Wannabe-Gangsterrapper aus L.A
Ey und wenn sie sehen, wie ich den Gebrauch der Gun übe
Machen sich deine Bodyguards aus dem Staub, wie Sandstürme
Ey während Frauen sich bei deim' Anblick biegen vor lachen
Überstehen sie meinen nicht ohne multiple Orgasmen
Meine Jeanshosentaschen sind prallgefüllt mit Scheinen
Statt Ersatzreifen im Kofferraum ein halbes Kilo Weißes
Nebenbei bemerkt haben die diamantenbesetzten Watches
Die das Handgelenk des Bosses zieren, 'ne Stange Geld gekostet
Ey das ist Kokamusik, das ist der totale Krieg
Bitch dir ist sowas zu viel

Ey ich komme in deine Gegend, Leute weinen Tränen
Es ist Kollegah der Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Ich komm mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich

Denn dir ist sowas zu viel
Ey das ist kein Battlerap
Das ist Messerstecher-Stresserrap, Kokamusik (Kokamusik)

Kollegah ? Das war krass auf jeden Fall
Aber ich hab ein Bitte an dich
Kannst du vielleicht nochmal
So so krass aufnehemn weißt du wie früher

Ja klar, für meine Fans doch gerne, pass auf

(Mutterficker)

Mutterficker das ist Kokamusik
Ich komme, zieh die Gun und sorg für den totalen Krieg,
So wie Omaha-Beach
Stepp in den Club und baller mir Nasen in dem Wert von deinem Monatsverdienst
Komm und hole dich bei Nacht aus deiner spießigen Doppelhaushälfte
Du siehst nur noch den sich schließenden Kofferraumdeckel
Nie mehr Tageslicht, nie wieder Sonnenaufgänge
Nur noch kurz ein auf dich zielendes Shotgunlauf-Ende
Ich komm mit Gewaltanwendern aus den Balkanländern
Bitches fächern mir Luft zu mit Palmenblättern
Hab im Ledermantel Weißes, leg auf elegante Weise
Meterlange Lines, bin high wie Alpengletscher
High wie Falkennester, durchkreuze deine Gegend
Es ist der Big Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Er kommt mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich
Räubereien täglich Euroscheine zählen
Ich trag unter beiden Armen dicke Geldsäcke
Parke den SL, checke ein in dem Loft
Einer renommierten Hotelkette,
Stepp über den hellgelben Fellteppich
Baller mir ne Line in den Kopf bleibe Boss
Und man munkelt, Bitch dass ich unterm Strich
Circa alle 14 Tage deine Mutter fick
Und das immer erst nachdem ich ihren Ausweis gecheckt hab
Um zu sehn, ob das auch wirklich deine Mutter ist
Der Boss steppt in die Hood, schwere Wolken am Himmel
Doch er ist sonnenbebrillt als wär's ein Sommeridyll
Und er macht selten Angaben darüber, wie viel er vertickt hat
Aber wenn, dann sind die stets in Tonne, wie Müll
Yeah, ich komme mit der Gun in deine Bude rein
Und demütige deine Mum auf ganz üble Weise
Geb ihr Schellen und schon lässt sie das Dampfbügeleisen
Elegant über meine Anzüge gleiten!

Ey und sie rufen seinen Namen, der Newcomer des Jahres
Auf einen wie ihn haben sie schon viel zu lange gewartet
All die Leute träumten von 'nem deutschen Act
Der keine abgefuckte Hoe war wie 99,9 Prozent 
Doch er war damals in der Hood und hatte eigene Sorgen
Das erste Tape hab ich damals noch ganz alleine recordet
Nur für paar Internetkids und mit Billig-Equipment
Paar Wochen später dann im Studio dann die X-Mas-Edition
Und viele meinten damals „Ey, das lässt sich nicht nochmal toppen!“
Doch ich drängte mit Boss der Bosse den Rest in die Opferrolle
Legte wiederum nach, mein Debutalbum chartete
Heut hab ich's geschafft yeah vom Dealer zum Star
Und bin der Beste hier, werde mit King of Rap betitelt
Dabei mach ich meine Arbeit mal eben so mit links wie Zeldaspieler

Er ist ein Auserwählter, wie ein Power-Ranger
Auf dem Weg nach oben, der amerikanische Traum
Nie mehr über die Grenze, zum Materialienkauf
Vor nicht mal zwei Jahren, da tickte ich noch Pep in der Hood
Heute hat ganz Deutschland auf die Goldkette geguckt
Ich hab Verkaufszahlen erreicht und geriet dabei dank raptechnisch
Herausragender Leistung zu 'ner Ausnahmeerscheinung
Einem Aushängeschild, das seitdem hauptsächlich mit
Preise abstauben zu tun hat wie meine Haushälterin
Und nach dem nächsten Kollegah-Album ergänzt die Trophäensammlung
Das ein oder andere Mitbringsel von der letzten Comet-Verleihung
Denn ich werd auch weiterhin alles und jeden zerbersten
Bis die ganze Menschheit Ahornblätter trägt wie der Herbstwind

Ich bin wie H auf der Straße, geh von der Straße auf die Stage
Denn ich bin und bleib ein, Selfmade Hustler

Hustle bis ich reich bin, zähl den Zaster
Keiner hält mich auf auf mein Weg!

Yeah, der beste, der rhymt auf Deutsch
Weiß oder braun, ich verteil das Zeug
Verneige dein Haupt, ich erschein' in deiner Town
Breit gebaut wie der zweite Joint
K zu dem O der Selfmade Hustler, 
ich steig in die Karre, trete das Gaspedal durch
Früher war es Übergabe auf Basketballcourts
Machte tageland durch, ging ich schlafen dann kurz
Yeah, ich hab binnen kürzerster Zeit

Mit dem ersten Album in die Charts
Meine Tracks sind Dauerbrenner wie olympisches Feuer

Mammutstoßzähne und andere Trophäen hängt
..K zum O, der Onlinebanker
Mit mehr One-Night-Stands als die Hochzeits-Crasher
Und auf den Knien, den Lauf der Gun zwischen den Zähnen
Wird dir schlagartig bewusst, du bist wohl DOCH kein Gangster
Du siehst mich aus dem Bentley rausklettern
Dann bei Leerkaufen von Fendi-Schaufenstern
Frauen lauschen meiner Stimme über Handylautsprecher
Und machen sich dann frei, wie Gefängnisausbrecher

Aufbrausend im Benz gestylt,die Türen gehen auf
Schon brennt die Scheiße
Wir rollen an,schon hängt die Kleine
Hechelnd an der Fensterscheibe
Bring sie her, kostenlos mach ich sie zu Charlotte Roche,
Zum Pavian, die Vagina
Verfärbt sich 2/3 Wochen Rot
Setz mich ein für Menschenfeinde
Vorbildlich und fresh gestylt
Zeig ich mich von der besten Seite
Heb den Krug und ex' die Scheiße
Und wer gerne mitmachen will
Muss sich, wir haben nur ein bisschen drauf stehen
Auszurasten, auszupacken, das und ein gewisses Aussehen
Wenn es klappt hielten sie Händchen
Und schon geht es verdächtig schnell ein Pflock in ihrem Kopf
Zu schieben wie beim Legomännchen
Sie hat mehr fremde Spinner,beherbergt als mein Gästezimmer
Ein paar Bier, 2 Döner nur mit Fleisch: ein perfektes Dinner
Und als Gastgeschenk stürmen vier Leute
Als Straßengang,bewaffnet in dein Haus und feiern Abrissparty

E-e-e-e-ey
Der Grund dafür dass deutsche Crews jetzt enttäuscht sind,
Weil sie in die Staaten wollten, wie der Flug 93
Meine Kugeln sind teuflich, weil auf dein Cap New Era steht,
Fühle mich sexuell erregt, wenn ich ein Gangsterrapper seh
Asphalt Massaka 2, der große Hype,
Man trifft euch im Fundbüro, weil ihr verloren seid
Mutterficker, ihr habt Paras, weil ihr euch Hero gabt,
Und Filme fahrt/Fard wie der Kameramann von Terrorbars
Von Tag zu Tag sinkt das Niveau von einem Bettler tiefer, doch das ist mir egal, denn ich hab im Bett Latifah
Deutscher Rap ist ein Schlachtfeld; Farid hat Hunger, und isst/ist Snacks (Snaga)

Du machst Rap für Kiffer, meine Hörer sind Hoes,
In körperbetonten Burberry-Hosen

Rapper mit dem Black Cadillac
An der Westside von Germany posend
Ich verkaufe das Koka, deal am Block, während dein Team paar Trottel sind, traurige Poser,
Die zu Hause auf dem Sofa mit Shisha hocken, und Fifa (Vieh ver-) zocken, wie Bauern beim Pokern
Du Häufchen Elend, mit Säuglingen ähnelnden,
Mickrigen Armen, chillst mit Kräutertee und Räucherstäbchen
In deinem Billigapartment, nichts schlimmes ahnend, und Däumchen drehend,
Wirst unverhofft, umgeboxt, stehst dann nicht mehr auf den Beinen, sondern unter Schock,
Kid, ich komme und führe deine Freundin in die hohe Kunst der Blowjobs ein und gebe der Nutte Cock,
Und du Bitch sagst: ""Fuck auf Bullen!"", aber solange wir in deiner Stadt chillen, hast du eins eins schon gewählt, und den Finger an der null,
Ey, das ist Hustlerrap, ich mach mein Cash, verticke in deiner City jede Nacht das Crack, koche es, und dann wird es in den Straßen abgesetzt, wie Taxigäste

Ich steige mit Kumpels aus dem A6,
Nehme dir Hundesohn dein Gras weg,
Ein osmanischer Tokat, was jetzt?
Bungalows und Barchecks,
Sitz mit Onkels im Cafe, und schaue zu wie mein Vater Fünfhunderter auf Schwarz setzt
Du hängst mit Abschaum,
Rauchst deinen Joint, und hast Pappmaul
Ich komm nachts raus, mit 8 Frauen,
Die genüsslich an meinem Sack kauen,
Ich ficke deine Lache denn ich tickte Weiß und machte
Para, als Savas noch einen Mittelscheitel hatte,
Damals, als man mich täglich noch am Block finden konnte,
Ich mein die Zeit als Curse sich noch nen Zopf binden konnte
Sag wie willst du Junkie dich in mein Geschäft einbau'n?
Hol die Papers, halt die Schnauze, du kannst mir ein' bau'n

Als ich geboren wurd' sagte Gott zu sich, man der wird mal ein böser Mensch sein,
Heute fick ich Weiber, und creme mir den Schwanz mit Löwensenf ein, rolle ihn aus mit Kabeltrommel
Flagge aufs Gesicht, ich fick das Vaterland und salutier wenn ich auf die Fahne komme
Ragazzi ah!
Schreit besser, weil es reicht nur ein Treffer
Denn ich schmeiß Messer auf euch schweinehässlichen scheiß Rapper,
Reihenweise schneid ich euch Scheiße in Scheiben, so wie ein Häcksler,
Nein besser, mein Sippii gleitet vorbei, wie Clyde Drechsler
Als kleines Kind war ich mal ein süßer Kacker,
Doch mit 13 Jahren hat' ich 'nen Schnurrbart, sowie Müslüm Baba,
Denk ruhig du wärst hart, doch dein Leben steht auf der Kippe,
In kalten Zeiten bleib ich hart, so wie ein Nippel auf 'ner Titte

Der Junge der nicht tanzt, gesunde Arroganz,
Das Alphatier spricht und alle Hunde haben Angst
Ich kenne keine Furcht, glaub mir, ich greife durch,
Ich will 'ne Frau die Whisky schwitzt und Hunderteuroscheine furzt
Komm vorbei, wir klären das Ganze alleine,
Frauen und Geld hab ich, aber Angst hab ich keine, Ghettoromantik
Ich steck den Schwanz in die Scheide,
Mein Tascheninhalt sorgt für tanzende Beine
Ich bin nicht Max Herre,
Doch Weiber lieben mich, weil ich mir vor dem Fickengehen meinen Sack kämme
Jungs aus der Unterschicht, ihr Bonzenkids habt keine Klasse,
Und feiert impotente Scheisse für die breite Masse,
Seitdem ich rappe, brauch ich keinen Plan B,
Ich schlag dir die Zähne aus, und ficke anschließend die Zahnfee",Terrorbars Infinity,2010

Sammelt Kiefernholzmobiliar aus dem 17. Jahrhundert

Bring' den Trizeps in Form, den Bizeps in Form
Und definier' den Körper wie'n Anatomielexikon

Kuck auf die Bitches, wie sie kreischen, der Boss tritt in die Eisen

Kuck aufs Ziffernblatt der Breitling, kuck auf die Hater
Wie sie im Netz haten, doch im Real Life Blickkontakt vermeiden
Kuck auf mein Business, für die Liste der zehn Reichsten

Gebe Gas im Range Rover, fahre zu deiner Bitch

Im Licht der Neonreklamen cool vorm Maybach steht
Du stehst höchstens vorm VW, wie U im Alphabet
Ich bin multitaskingfähig, halt die Uzi an dein' Schädel
Drücke ab und geb's dabei grad zwanzig Groupies parallel

Ein Uppercut und du fliegst in die Umlaufbahn vom Jupiterplanet
See u later, du Bitch, erzähl nich', was für'n Player du bist
Denn der Boss rollt durch die Neighborhood, sitzt
Hinter mokkabraun getönten Fenstern mit Chicks im fetten Beamer

Voll gestrecktem Pep, ich vercheck' die Packets an Ghetto Dealer
Der Chauffeur manövriert den King so wie Tekkenspieler
Du Crackbitch bettelst mich nett an, dich auf deim Track zu featuren
Weg mit dir, man, deine Raptexte sind whack, versteck dich lieber
Oder der Mac hält Magnums und Tecs an dein' Head und streckt dich nieder
Fetzt dich weg und du liegst da verletzt im Dreck mit zerfetzten Gliedern
Kid, ich gleite über die Meeresoberfläche
Auf 'nem Segelboot, bespreche dort am Telefon Geschäfte
Mach' nachts in Edelclubs mit Szenedrogen Cash
Tick Coke und Es an Prominente aus der Regenbogenpresse
Geh' mit AK-47 auf dich los, denn du machst auf Pimp
Aber daheim sieht man deine Bitch dann im Befehlston mit dir sprechen
Du musst zuhören, nicken und die Fußböden wischen
Denn du stehst unterm Pantoffel so wie Schuhgrößen, Bitch
Meine Crew tötet dich, man sieht Blut strömen bis
Es Richtung Himmel in die Flughöhe von Zugvögeln spritzt
Und du hast Angst um deine Sister, hab' ich Gigs in deiner Stadt
Denn letztes Jahr hatte ich ja bereits den Dick in deiner Slut
Und du sprichst von Heirat, doch ich treff' deine Chick im Nightclub
Ein, zwei Whiskey und sie sitzt im Maybach
Es braucht nich' viel Einsatz, bis die Bitch sich freimacht
Der Aufwand is' ein minimaler wie Disney-Zeichner
Und ich seh ihren Stringtanga
Denn ihr Minirock is' knapper als Trinkwasser in Kinshasa
Ich mach' ihr Hoffnungen, den Pimp zu heiraten
Und sie freut sich wie ein Kind zu Weihnachten
Und sie reagiert auf mein bestes Teil mit Schreckensschreien
Auf deins auch, aber nur wegen deinen Geschlechtskrankheiten
Es wär besser für dich, jetzt zu schweigen
Oder von der Brücke zu springen und wegzutreiben mit Rettungsreifen
Denn siehst du den Mac aus dem Lexus steigen
Steht dein Leben auf Messers Schneide wie das Nesmuk-Zeichen
Zwischen dein' Homes und meinen gibt's nen Größenunterschied
Denn meine Homies sind Schränke wie bei „Die Schöne und das Biest“
Und du willst dein' Kadett parken, doch siehst den pechschwarzen
Aston und erstarrst, denn sowas kennst du nur von Quartettkarten
Ich lass' deine Geliebte blowen, diese Ho
Hat dann zwar nur einen Schwanz zu blasen
Dennoch ist die Auswahl riesengroß
Kid, und du schreibst paar Punchlines auf das Blatt
Doch ich komm' und box' dich um und du willst Anzeige erstatten
Ey, kein Ding, mach nur! Denn guck, deine Crackbitch
Behandelt mich vor Gericht wie ihren Esstisch und deckt mich
Renn zu den Bullen, aber du stirbst
Nachdem du gesungen hast als seist du Nate Dogg
Deine Gang zittert wie Michael J. Fox

Kollegah,"Ich sitz' im Studio, starr' auf die grauen Tapeten
Draußen Dauerregen, drinnen blauer Nebel
Atme den Weed-Smoke aus, in den Augen Tränen
In der Hand die Knarre, ich denk dran aufzugeben
Denn sie ist nicht mehr da, im Haus herrscht Leere
Und ich such jeden Morgen nach 'nem Grund aufzustehen
Homies rufen an, doch ich will kaum noch reden
Sie war die Eine, die Frau für's Leben
Jetzt ist sie weg, gezwungen zur Heirat mit
Irgendeinem Großcousin aus ihrer Heimat, shit
Irgendein Bastard, den sie davor vielleicht einmal trifft
Er weiß sie nicht zu schätzen, doch besitzt sie, life's a bitch
Und ich red' mir verzweifelt ein, eines Tages nehm'
Ich sie wieder in die Arme im Garten Eden
Über den Wolken im Himmel
Kokain ist der Teufel, doch er betäubt meine Sinne
Ich baller Lines mit den Homies und lenke mich ab vor der Playsi
Werd' nie wieder schlafen und halte mich tagelang wach
Denn ich träum' jede Nacht von meinem Baby
Sie hielt mich von Sünden ab, meine Lady
Jetzt sitz ich hier wieder und zieh' Coke
Ich wurde zum besseren Menschen durch sie
Jetzt kille ich wieder die Zeit in der Spielo
Doch ich gebe keinen Fick, sie ist weg und ich zieh' los
Verspiele das Geld für die Villa für unsere Familie im Casino
Geh' Richtung Sonnenuntergang auf den Bahngleisen
Entweder sie oder gar keine

Du, du, weißt du denn nicht
Du warst alles für mich
Du, du, sag mir, siehst du denn nicht
Wie sehr es mich trifft, dass du nicht hier bist
Du, du, reicht es dir nicht
Ich gab alles für dich
Du, du, jetzt liebst du mich nicht
Mein Herz, das zerbricht, mein Ende in Sicht

Seit Wochen nich' rasiert, exe die Jack Daniels-Reste
Jalousien zu, starr' mit nem leeren Blick
Aufs Fernsehtestbild, nehm' 'ne Antidepressiva
Raus aus der Tablettenpackung
Seh' uns're Ringen zwischen leeren Zigarretenschachteln
Und ich seh an der Wand die leere weiße Fläche
Wo damals die Bilder hingen
In einer Hand zerrissene Fotos von uns
Und in der anderen Hand die beiden Silberringe
Spüre den Schmerz tief in der Brust
Renn' dann in's Bad, hau dann den Spiegel kaputt
Wisch die Tränen mit den blutigen Händen
Aus dem Gesicht, atme schwer und kriege kaum Luft
Ich hasse die Welt, hasse mich selbst
Denk' an die Zeit, geh' mit der Erinnerung ins Bett
Schlaf' zwei Tage lang, werde nich' wach
Handy seit paar Wochen aus, ich glaub ich schmeiß es weg
Denn sie ruft sowieso nich' an
Es rufen allerhöchstens meine Homies an
Doch ich will kein' seh'n
Riesige Wohnung, Isolation und Selbstmitleid, ich ertränke in Trän'
Momente, die wir hatten, sie verschwinden im Nebel
Zünde mir 'ne Zigarette an, blas' den Rauch raus aus dem Fenster
Ich glaub', ich spring' raus aus dem Fenster
Seh' von oben herab auf die Stadt und ich trau' mich nich'
Zöger noch ein' kurzen Augenblick
Steige von der Fensterbank, zieh mir 'ne Jacket an
Ich laufe raus in die Hood, kauf' mir Shit
Boxe dem Dealer die Nase rot
Komme nich' klar, ich suche mir 'ne Bank
Drehe mir 'nen Blunt, mach ihn an
Sitz allein in der Nacht in dem Park
Ich bin völlig nass, kalter Regen fällt und erlöscht den Blunt
Aber leider nich' den Schmerz
Und die höllische Qual, fühle mich wie paralysiert
Wie konnte ich sie damals verlier'n?
Warum immer ich? Immer ich, innerlich alles erfriert
Mir war nie bewusst, was für 'ne Schönheit sie is'
Ich meinte es ernst, als ich sagte: ""Schatz, ich würde töten für dich""
Doch ich hoffe, jetzt tötet es mich
Warte jeden Tag auf die Erlösung im Licht
Nehme 'ne Pille, nehme noch 'ne Pille, mache weiter
Lehne mich zurück auf der Bank
Schau' zum Himmel hoch, ich gebe keinen Fick auf mein Leben
Schlafe ein mit dem Gedanken

Aber ich steh' einfach nich' so auf das Gefühl, zu bezahl'n

Nie wirklich arm, doch konnte nachts trotzdem nie ruhig schlafen
Wegen Kilogramm-Packungen Speed, Crack und Gras

Es war Drogen verchecken, um Kautionen zu blechen
Und überzogene Rechnungen der Wohnung zu decken

Sie zögert und meint, sie sei keine Schlampe wie der Rest
Keine Groupie-Bitch, die man bangt und dann wieder verlässt
Sie hat Angst, dass sie sich verliebt und Angst, dass sie verletzt wird
Ich lächel', reich' ihr kurz den Blunt und sie relaxt, sagt:
""Eigentlich bist du gar nich' so arrogant wie in dein' Tracks""
Und um zwanzig vor 6 liegt sie schlafend in mei'm Arm
Und ich tipp' in mein Handy mit der linken Hand diesen Text
Momentaufnahme aus dem Leben eines Players
Frauenherzen schlagen für Kollegah
Als wär'n sie seine Bodyguards, doch es is' schwer
Ein gutes Mädchen zu finden, wenn du fame bist und Money hast
Irgend'ne Bitch schickt 'ne SMS
Ihr Freund sei zwar nett, aber langweilig und schlecht im Bett
Ich antworte nicht, leg' das Handy weg
Schließ' die Augen, denk' an mein Baby, hoff', sie is' happy jetz'

Du warst so gut für mich und ich hab' es jetz' gemerkt
Ich hasse dich, Player
Ich hasse dich, Player

Ich wach' auf, hör' in der Dusche das Wasser laufen
Die Tür geht auf, sie kommt raus mit nasser Haut
Kommt ans Bett, beugt sich über mich, küsst mich sanft
Und dabei fällt ihr nasses Haar in mein Gesicht, es riecht nach Shampoo
Sie wickelt sich ein Handtuch um die Hüften, zieht sich an
Und schaut mir traurig in die Augen: ""Sag, versprichst du, dass du anrufst?""
Klar, Shawty, und jetz' lass die Fragen
Und geh, dein Taxi wartet, es wird still
Und ich muss wieder an sie denken, versuch', mich abzulenken
Bin nur im Studio wie die Truman Show
Doch es hilft nichts
Ich bin allein in einer Welt voller Sex, Drugs und Groupie-Hoes
Und ich bin in dieser Welt gefang', sie war ein Engel
Rein, doch ich bin ihr mit 'ner Menge Schlampen fremdgegang'

Sie zu vergessen, im Sommer geht's
Doch es geht schwerer, wenn die Temperaturen
Immer seltener ins Plus gehen
Die Zeit, in der die Blätter durch die Luft wehen
Und Kids in dicken Sweatern durch die Hood gehen
Dieses Leben is' seltsam, Bro

Ich geh raus mach die Kundschaft high
Ich schnall das Herbertz an die Jeans
Es gibt Ärger nachts auf den Streets
Bunker 1, 2 Kilo Coke in den Airbags meines Jeeps
Import aus Holland, im Rückspiegel das Zollamt
Brate pazi se, novac leti, metak pali
Verräter-Fotzen lachen, machen einen auf brate hey
Ich schneid dein Hals auf, jugoslawische Krawatte
Blut tropft auf den Asphalt, scheiß auf die Staatsgewalt
Lenke das Business, wenn es sein muss aus der Strafanstalt
Jugo Cafés, 3 Kilogramm Schnee
Cash im Wandtresor hinterm Tito Portrait
9 Millimeter scharf in der Prada Jeans
Kokaingeschäfte nachts mit Balkaner G’s
T-T-Taschen voller Geld, die Maschine wartet
Ich heb' ab, leg' 'ne Line auf und zieh' 'ne Nase… Cocaina

Baby, das ist Kokayne
Kamera-Cut, ballern auf Cops
Baby, das ist Kokayne
Tacker bei Nacht, das macht dich wach
Baby, das ist Koka-a-a-yne
Drück ab, ich bang' wie Castor Troy
Baby, das ist Kokayne
Steh' nachts mit 6k Flex am Royce, Kokayne

Werf ein' Blick durch die Jalousie nachts im Hotel
Packe das Geld, heute brennen die Stadtlichter hell
Draußen Junkies und Cops, Nebel und Smog
Cash gegen Flex, Limit 10 Kilo Stoff
Autowerkstatt, ich schweiß das Originalteil auf
Blackcard White drauf, Test, Zahnfleisch taub
Kleb das Flex an die Chopper Karosserie
Transportier die restlichen Stoffe, 2 Koffer, fahr offensiv
Auf der Schnellstraße Nebel, Blaulichtsirene
Windschatten, überholen, Aufsicht erregend
Sportauspuff schallt, du hörst den Sound in der Gegend
Ich halt an vor dem Club, es prasselt auf mich der Regen
С собой 10 килограмм белого
Übergebe die Ware dem Kopf der Russenmafia

Ich push das Koka an Monaco-Adel
Starte den Motor, push die Tachonadel hoch auf 180
Rase nachts durch schwarze Hochhausschluchten
Park vor dem Großraumclub, der Chromauspuff spuckt Drachenatem
Steige aus, geh vorbei an den Securities
Versorg die High Society mit Weißem aus den Gucci Jeans
VIP Area, eisgekühlte Bottles
Tick die Packtes an Anwälte und weichgespülte Snobs
Mach 3,4 Mille mit Flex
Der leere Sohn ? 
hat die weiten Pupillen hinter seiner teuren Designer Brille versteckt
Zwei Studentinnen auf dem Dancefloor, Lesbo-Action
Ich seh wie sie sich gegenseitig vom Body das Flex ablecken
Ahhh Kokslegah

Kollegah,"Kid, ich bin der Mac in diesem Business 
Und ticke dicke Packets an die Kids
Step mit der glitzernden Kette in den Club
Zerre deine Bitch auf Toilette
Und ficke der den arroganten Blick aus der Fresse
Du holst dir mein Album und sagst, ich bin der Beste
Doch ich dreh' mit deiner Mutter Porn-Tapes
Komm in deine Villa mit der Basy, gebe deinem Body Punches
Alle deine Rippen zerbersten wie Cornflakes
Keiner dieser Rapper kann so viele Bitches
Zu der selben Zeit in zehn Städten haben
Ohne, dass die Weiber irgendwann checken, was abgeht
Kid, ich hab' allein in deiner City circa sieben oder acht Babes, was geht?
Und ich mache Business und tick' an all die Sluts H
Roll' in deine City rein im silbernen Lex
Mache deine Lady, die du liebst, zu deiner Ex
Sie vergöttert meinen Body, Kid, ich baller mir das Flex
Habe dann noch mit der Nutte circa sieben Stunden Sex
Alle Gs in deiner Town wissen, mein Wort is' hier Gesetz
Kid, ich komme mit der goldenen Kette
Baller dir Wannabe da voll in deine Fresse, besser renn in dein Versteck
Rapper wollen gern eine Kollabo
Kommen an und callen dann den Mac am Handy, leider ist immer besetzt
Denn ich hab keine Zeit für diese Penner
Kid, ich mache lieber Business in Holland
Habe kiloweise Pep in dem Kofferraum und roll über den Zoll
Ich mache Money mit der Ware, Motherfucker, komm mir nich' mit deinem Rap
Ich habe leider keinen Nerv für deine „supertollen“ Tracks
Deutscher Rap is' eine Bitch und ich versorge sie mit Crack
Mache mit der Nutte Cash, und es wird immer mehr wie von allein
Kid, ich habe 'nen Lauf wie meine Tec
Gebe keinen Fick auf deine Gang, komm an und zücke meine Gun
Baller dir Kugeln in dein Head und du verreckst

Uzi-Läufe schwarz wie die Mondfinsternis
Ziele mit der Gun, kille deine Gang, rolle weg im Jeep
Baller Luden tot und das Rotlicht erlischt
Kugeln in der Luft, renne durch die Hood, volles Magazin
Gucci-jacket weiß, das is' Koksticker-Biz
Lege mir 'ne Line, rolle mir 'nen Blunt, holländisches Weed
Lass die Lady tanzen auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Ich zerfetze Rapper mit 'nem Messer, besser gib mir deine Kette
Penner renn, ich bin der King in dem Block

Koksticker-biz
Ich spanne meine Muskeln an und erzeuge damit eine Mondfinsternis
Rapper ballern Steroide, machen dann auf harten Bodybuilder
Doch blicken zu Boden, wenn sie Kollegah trifft
Und ich gebe keinen Fick auf deine Doubletime-Flows
Ich vertick' an deine Mama das Coke
Sie kann nicht bezahlen, denn die Bitch hat keine Kohle
Gar kein Ding, ich lass die Nutte vor der Kamera blown, uh
Und du siehst im Internet
Wie deine Rap-Idole gerne auf Über-G mit Taschen voller Money machen
Aber kleine Insider-Info
Die meisten dieser Penner sind in ihrem wahren Leben geradezu broke
All' die dicken Karren in den Clips sind nur geliehen
Die Bitches haben nich' mal 'nen Führerschein, das ist alles nur Show
Der einzige, der real geblieben ist, in diesem Game voller Versager
Bitch, ist Kollegah, der Rest sind alles Hoes
Und du weißt, ich könnte wenn ich will
Alle diese sogenannten Rapper-Karrieren
In diesem Land ohne Probleme zerficken
Mit einem einzigen Track
Aber dafür bin ich leider viel zu busy mit anderen Sachen
Wie zum Beispiel ihre Mütter ficken
Nachdem diese Bitches meine Villa sauber machen
Mir dann liebevoll den Nacken massieren und dann auf allen Vieren gehen
Mit Augen, die vor Freude glänzen wie der Mond
Oder die Felgen an dem Benz voller Chrom
Komm mir dumm und ich halte dir die Tec an den Head
Zieh dann den Trigger, Mutterficker du bist tot
Und alle deine Möbel in der Wohnung werden rot
Wie die Augen deiner Mutter, wenn sie weint um ihren Sohn
Es ist der Boss, ich durchstreife im Maybach das Viertel
Die meisten MCs haben keinerlei Würde
Sie ficken nur Crack-Schlampen
Ich stoße Chicks von der Bettkante, die sie heiraten würden

Uzi-Läufe schwarz wie die Mondfinsternis
Ziele mit der Gun, kille deine Gang, rolle weg im Jeep
Baller Luden tot und das Rotlicht erlischt
Kugeln in der Luft, renne durch die Hood, volles Magazin

Kollegah,"Und ich sitz' in meiner Ein-Zimmer-Bruchbude
Nur ein Stuhl, ein Tisch und darauf ein Kilo Coke
Ich starr' es an wie in Trance, atme dann tief ein
Knacke den Nacken, knacke mit den Fingern, Let's go
Und die Stunden vergeh'n, ich pack's in Päckchen zu 2g
2 Uhr nachts, alles ready, ich zieh' den letzten Rest weg und geh'
Und der Stoff is' killer, jeder will was, ich fahr' rum, verteil das Koks
Non-Stop Handy-Calls, Übergabe, reibungslos
Einsteigen, kurz testen, taubes Zahnfleisch, positiv
Zahlen und gehen von A nach B, Drogendeals im großen Stil
Bis die ersten Vögel zwitschern, Sonnenaufgang, 10 nach sechs
Ich check' im Handschuhfach, wie viel noch da is' alles weg
Ab zum Drive-In, bestell' sechs Cheeseburger
Schmeiß' dem Typ' 'ne handvoll Scheine in die Fresse: ""Hier, Bruder""
Park' am Stadtrand, kill' die Burger, roll' das Weed ins Blättchen ein
Zieh' am Blunt, feier' mich und schlaf' mit 'nem Lächeln ein
Werd um 12 wach, hol' mein Girl ab in der Stadt
Ab zur Kö, shoppen, Gucci, Dior, Louis Vuitton
Kauf' ihr dies, kauf' ihr das, kauf' ihr alles, was ihr passt
Sie wird eingekleidet wie Diven bei den Music-Awards
Wartet im Beauty-Salon, ich fahre los zum Ferrari-Dealer
Zahle Cash, fahre back zum Laden, parke den Wagen, sie kommt raus
Kreischt, springt rein, küsst meine Stirn, ich frag' „Wer is' der King?“
Sie sagt „Baby, du bist der King!“

Money gibt dir, was du hast
Gestern Breitling, heute Handschellen

Schulden hier, Schulden da, ey, diese Stofftickerei
Is' wie'n Blowjob-Porno: nix als Kopffickerei
Und sie wollen an mein (Money), 
Doch ich sitz' in meinem Penthouse-Loft
Sage, fickt euch alle!, zieh' 
'ne Line und fühl' mich wie'n Gangster-Boss
Vor mir auf dem Tisch 50k plus ein Zentner Stoff
Ich ruf' nach meinem Baby, sie kommt an mit gesenktem Kopf
Ich winke sie zu mir, heb' ihr Kinn, sie hat probiert
Ihr blaues Auge mit Schminke zu kaschier'n
Sie schaut mich an mit leerem Blick
Ich hör' in Zeitlupe, wie sie sagt
„Ich kann nich' mehr, du bist nicht der gleiche, 
Der du mal warst, es is' aus""
WAS? Ich tick' aus und so schnell sie kann
Rennt sie zur Tür, ich schmeiß' 'ne Vase, sie zerschellt an der Wand
Ich renn' ihr nach in den Flur, du ehrenlose Bitch!
Wer hat dich damals aus dem Dreck geholt? Was wärst du ohne mich?
Egal, ich brauch' sie nicht, ich brauch' niemand', ich hab' Money
Mache Money, stecke Money in die Jeans von Armani
Steck' mein' Kopf in den Koka-Berg, sniffe es pur
Hebe den Kopf, höre Schritte im Flur
Sie treten meine Tür ein, ich öffne die Schublade
Und steck' das Magazin in die Schusswaffe

Wir laden AK-Magazine nach, ziehen dann scharf und dein Team kriegt Panik und flieht
Ich flow hart mit dem Beat, ein Schlag, du liegst, JBG 2 wird nach dem Release von
Straßen-Gs und hunderten Girls rauf und runtergehört wie Fahrstuhlmusik
Meine Anatomie ist stahlhart so wie diese Stadt aus Beton
Wo ich grad diesen Song schreib und dabei Blowjobs von 'ner Mulattin bekomm, im Bugatti Veyron
Und es ist Fakt, ich bin Don, lege wie James Bond Sluts flach, was, du willst fronten
Du hast so viel Chancen wie 'n unbewaffneter Bonze nachts in der Bronx, Bastard, ich komm
In dein Haus mit Farid, du siehst die Muskelprotze
Du plünderst dein Sparschwein, denn es ist wieder mal Zeit für (Schutzgeld, Fotze)
Du bist immer noch ein Nichts, ich immer noch der Typ
Der Gs beim Händeschütteln aus versehen die Fingerknochen bricht

Ey, ich bin Godfather, Block-Hustler, Gangbanger, Rapper
Golf 3 ist cool, doch der Benz steht mir besser
Ich mach Mucke für Gangs und Verbrecher
Das letzte, das du hörst, ist das Bang der Beretta

Kriminelle Bodybuilder wollen Welle machen, ich baller mir 'ne Pille, denn wir nehmen Anabol
Alle Weiber kommen elegant in den Benz, ich ficke deine billige Bitch jetzt
Wie viele Kokaticker machen Politik und ficken deiner Mutter die Clit weg
Ficke Pädophile mit der Pumpgun, komm mit einem Butterfly, ich fick Rap
Das Cash nehme ich dir vor deiner ganzen Bande ab
Du bist ein Hundesohn, gebe dir 'nen Uppercut
Jetzt ist Massaker, ich bleibe ein echter G
Und sehe rot wie Zidane bei seinem letzten Spiel
Ich verteil Ohrfeigen
Und fühle nichts wie Bitches, die in deine Short greifen
Und der Anschlag auf diese verfeindete Crowd
Wird von 'nem Taliban ausgeführt wie verschleierte Frauen

Und egal ob ich Rapper mit der Pumpgun erschieß' oder alternativ mit der Walther zersieb'
Es geht bam bam bam, jeder Ballermann knallt eine Hand Punks auf den Asphalt in den Streets
Und ich ticke wieder Cannabis an deine Mama, mache dann 'ne Mille bar bei illegalen Pokerduellen
Öffne dann damit einige Nobelbordelle, geh das Koka bestellen bei Drogenkartellen
Fliege dann im Nebel über Ozeanwellen nach Polen, bange dort einige Fotomodelle
Komm im Anzug nachts, allein mein Handschuhfach ist doppelt so groß wie deine Wohnungstoilette
Und du willst ein Battle mit dem Überboss und bitte mach mal langsam, lass es lieber
K zu dem O mit der Magnumpistole, neben mir wirkt Van Damme wie Justin Bieber
Ich fliege nach Afrika, mache Safari-Jagd mit Pumpguns vom Waffendealer

Die Cops im Nacken hab, du deine Krawatte, nachdem
Sich nach dem Box dein Kopf um locker 180 Grad dreht
Ey, was wir machen, nachdem wir dein Gebiet betreten

Erzähl nicht, du wärst Player, denn Sex mit Chicks
Hast du nur im Puff und Nutten zählen nicht wie Fair Player am Black-Jack-Tisch
Deine Hobbies, Joints rauchen, Bong kiffen, meine Hobbies
Gold kaufen, Stoff ticken, 9 Frauen im Loft ficken
Und grinsen, wenn deine heulenden Boys auf den rostigen
Coltlauf vom Boss blicken, voll down wie Kopfkissen

Sieht man keine Fans da wie in Gummizellen
Schau deine Bitch an als wenn's keine andre gibt
Nein, ich schau sie an, weil keine andre gibt
Deine ganze Clique mach ich mit Totschlägern bekannt
Wenn du wichst, nimmst du dein kleinstes Problem in die Hand
Deine Kollegen sind dran, ich geb' den Hunden Prügel
Während Schwule wie du sich mit Jungs vergnügen
Und zu gerne Schwanz blasen, denn ihr seid
Wie Schotten, Männer, die die Hosen nicht anhaben

Whisky in die Cola, während Rapper twittern
Reiße ich mehr Frauen auf als Jack the Ripper
Puder in den Jeans, welcher Hurensohn will Beef

Chill auf Kokabergen, die größer sind als Atomkraftwerke

Filmst du das ganze staunend mit dei'm iPhone mit Display-Riss

Ey, Jungs, die auf der Street 'nen hohen Einsatz wagen
Werden wie ich oder enden im Einsatzwagen
Ich rap einfach Straße, ziehe Nasen
Und steche dabei heraus wie Igelhaare

Wir sind das Rapmonopol, die Hauptkommandozentrale
Die Traumkollabo des Jahres knallt wie Autokarambolagen
Denn der Sound kommt halt von der Straße wie dein Saufboldvater am Abend
Bitch, wir machen Rapnewcomer zu Baumwollplantagensklaven
Consciousrapper machen Wirbel um Nichts wie 'n Staubtornado Saharas
Doch die Message ist heiße Luft wie 'ne Rauchwolke von Indianern
Ich halt' Shotguns auf Metrickz
Nehme mir seine Fotze, gebe der Kleinen Cock und dreh' dann dabei 'nen Blog wie bei Tetris
Red nicht, ich fick' die Krüppelszene und zerstückel' jeden
Dieser Rapper, die von der Stütze leben wie Krückenläden
Jeder singt und tanzt, alles einheitlich, Schwuchteln
Jetzt wird Rap wieder steinzeitlich
Alles feige Bitches, labert nicht von Stolz und Ehre
Mann, was für Männer? Ihr seid Schafe, die gemolken werden
Während wir Kings sind und es schamlos raushängen lassen
Wie Bumaye seine Bauchspeckmasse

Gestern Bratwurst mit Senf, heute Hardcore-Moslem

Doch bevor er das tut, werd' ich seinen Schädel aufbrechen
Mit einem Totschläger wie Veysel aus Essen
Shindy sagt zu seiner Mutter, „Mach einen Vaterschaftstest
Denn vielleicht bin ich der Sohn von Kanye West“, ah
Ganz egal, in welchem deutschem Bundesland
Ich lass' V-Männer verschwinden wie das Zeugenschutzprogramm
Bitch, weil Para nie da war wie mein kanadischer Vater
Wollen wir Beute und sehen rot, albanischer Adler
Kid, ey yo, die Drogenmafiapaten
Gehen mit Kobrahautsandalen über Kokastrauchplantagen
Lassen Läufer Zeug verteilen zwischen den Großstadthausfassaden
Wir sind wie Venedig, wir kommen mit Boten auf den Straßen
Es sind Robocop und Terminator
Damit wir zwei aufs Cover passen, muss der Grafiker per Photoshop die Körper schmälern

X-Large, denn ich fick' hart, du wirst sexuell misshandelt (Pussy)

Komme mit Bangern in goldenen Gewändern, sie stecken Dolche in Rapper

Baller' dem gottlosen Cro in seinen Kopf Munition
Verliebt sich eine Frau in mich, dann nur per Stockholm-Syndrom

Mit einem B am Hals wie Anis Ferchichi
Kill' in Westberlin TC aus dem Escalade

Aus „Komm, lass paar Mütter ficken“ wurd' 'ne Geschäftsbranche
Damals im Rapgenre verkaufte niemand CDs
Wir kamen wie 'ne Armee und haben G-Rap geprägt
Wurden immer noch wie Wintersportler schief angesehen
JBG? Farid Bang? Boss, warum featurst du den?
Ich ließ die Kritiker stehen, sie fanden den Rap niveaulos
Wir haben im Tagteammodus ihre Theorien widerlegt
Den Markt hier wiederbelebt
Mit JBG 2, Ergebnis harter Arbeit, uns wurd' nix in die Wiege gelegt
Wir gingen den widrigen Weg
Haben bei Beef die Kollegen in dieser Szene einfach übertrieben niedergemäht
Sind jetzt die Leader im Game, haben keine Ferien gemacht
Sondern Imperien geschaffen und mehr Bizeps denn je
Die Mios liegen im Safe, was für Riesenbudgets?
Bruder, was sind 80.000 für einen Videodreh? (Ha)
Mois, wenn ich ein Jahr meine Steuern nicht bezahl'
Reißt es Deutschland in 'ne Staatspleite und Krisen entstehen
Und selbst wenn mal ein Jahr ohne Releases vergeht

Läuft bei dir, Bruder! Läuft bei dir, Bruder!
Bist du satt? Niemals, guck, was aus Deutschrap wird, Bruder
Nur noch Biter, nur noch Fotzen, nur noch Krüppel im Business
Es wird Zeit! Für was? Wieder paar Mütter zu ficken!

Wirst du in Tempelhof rasiert wie'n Shaolinkampfmönch
Also was guckst du so? MOK, geh mir deine Mutter holen
Dein Tape gibt's nicht bei Amazon, sondern bei ArmerNuttensohn
Ich zieh' Butterflies und Laas kann nicht ma' mehr gehen

Sick in the brain, Netflix and Chill mit der Braut von Sido

Sie will die Spermaspuren kaschieren und fragt mich, „Hast du Handtücher?“
Ne, aber da drüben steht Sun Diego, also Schwamm drüber (yeah)
Was los? Ihr ganzen arschgefickten Stricher
Macht Japanische Gesichter wie Animeentwickler
Denn Teil drei setzt noch einen drauf, scheiß auf zeitgemäßen Sound
Wir bringen Sound, damit pushst du dich vorm Thaiboxtraining auf

Zugedröhnte Hurensöhne machen auf Kokaschmuggler
Doch gehen heut total unter wie Royal Bunker (hehe)

Auf den Nacken von Franzosen wie Guillotinen
Mach dir für deine lächerlichen Texte Skizzen

Fahr' den Lambo Farbe Mango
Meine Gang geht all-in

Ich komm' fresh im Deus-Maximus-Shirt
Lebensmotto: Mehr Curls, mehr Girls
Der Rest ist Jacke wie Hose (yeah)
Oder wie MOK sagt: Flasche wie Dose (aha)
Ich hab' in Kapstadt paar Slums angeguckt (what the fuck?)
Und mich fast am Champagner verschluckt
Alpha-Banger ist die Family (ey, yeah, ey, yeah)
Mittelfinger für die Enemys
Und während sich grad wieder ma' 'ne Gang bekriegt
Chill' ich mit Kylie in Venice Beach
Mein Handy beept, Drive-by in Compton
Ich sag', „Rest in Peace“ und geh' Tennis spielen (c'est la vie)
Und Kim K. sagt
„Hol den Jet-Ski, ich will auf diese Insel da!“
Doch der Booty von Kim ist ein Pfirsich
So verliert sie die Balance wie ein Kind auf der Kirmes

Ich häng' ab im Gold's Gym
Bitch, ich hab' die Chrome-Rims
Fahr' den Lambo Farbe Mango
Meine Gang geht all-in (ballin')

Ich chill' mit Kylie und Kim K. in Beverly (Beverly Hills)
Ich bin nicht John F., doch ich kenne die

Bitches im Venice nennen uns Papi Chulos
Sie wissen genau, wir sind zwei Stars in Europe
Die ganze Nacht über WhatsApp am Texten
Ich frage sie, „You wanna see my Poststamp-Collection?“
Mit Gun am Strand, dann kommt die Polizei
Sie lassen uns laufen, sind nicht engstirnig wie Robert Geiss
Dicker Oberarmumfang, wir spielen Volleyball am Strand
Und hoffentlich will die Fotze Dick und blowt deshalb den Schwanz

Huh, du weißt genau, ich zerficke die Mütter der Rapper vom Ghetto durch
Denn die Bild-Journalisten wollen die Masse manipulieren wie 'ne Testokur
Ahh, Rapper wollen in der Disko spielen
Denken, sie stehen über uns, doch haben keine History
JBG heißt zuschlagen, bis du kapierst
Trete als Gewinner ab oder warte, bis du verlierst, ah

JBG 3 ist Platin, was sind Newcomerhypes?
Geld kommt, Geld geht, doch eine Bruderschaft bleibt
Eine Kugel, sie reicht für dich Sohn einer Slut

Und der Kreis wird immer kleiner wie bei Fortnite-Zockern

Ah, ich seh' die Konkurrenz nur noch durch mein Zielfernrohr
Jeder Track ein Todesbrett wie 'n Ouija-Board
Wir schleppen Bitches ab, machen den Mansory-Benz zu 'nem Viehtransport
Gehen niemals vor jemand in die Knie, weil die Gs es feiern wie 'n Bibelchor
Sie wollen uns mundtot machen (hey)
Sie fordern den Echo-Verweis
Nackenschellen für Journalisten, dann habt ihr auch ma' paar Verbände am Hals (hey)
Eure Hetzkampagnen stützen sich auf nichts
Wie euer Knochenmark, denn ihr seid rückgratlose Bitches
Eure Grenzen, sie verschwimmen wie Michael Phelps, wenn er blind wär'
Irgendwann rappen wir nichts mehr, irgendwann sprechen wir nichts mehr
Egal, mein Rap bleibt menschenverachtend
Aber nicht so menschenverachtend wie DSDS-Staffeln
Wir zwei sind ein Bündnis for life, der Körper klar definiert
Im Gegensatz zu eurem Verständnis von Künstlerfreiheit (Künstlerfreiheit)

Unter all den Lauchrappern im Game
Die sich an dir hochziehen wollen (aha) wie aus deinem Pool herauskletternde Babes“
Es gibt Fausttreffer vors Face, bis du Missgestalt es raffst
Mein Herz ist bitterkalt wie 'n Ritter im Mittelalter mit Axt (yeah)
Stepp' ich sick spittend ins Blitzlicht, dann nickt der ganze Club
Denn, Nutte, die Texte sind wie Lepra, meine sicken Parts gehen ab
Es sind Boss und Banger, Fotzen schwängernde Pimps in Westenstaaten
Eskapaden im Aston Martin mit deiner Bitch in den Wechseljahren
Stechen aus der Masse raus wie damals, als wir Messer nahmen
Und deiner fetten Mum 'nen Hurensohn aus dem Becken stachen
Denn einer von deiner Sorte reicht, du kleine Spast-Geburt
Ich klatsch' dich kurz auseinander, dann braucht dein Fach-Chirurg 'nen Bastelkurs

Ah, und ihr seid leider Geschichte
Ich hab' mehr Rapper gefickt als die Weiße von SXTN
Mein Benz hat breitere Sitze, mein Lat kommt raus
Und mein Rücken sieht wie eine Walnuss aus
Werd' dich auf Livetouren mit Bleikugeln heimsuchen
Trag' ich nur eine Uhr, hat sie den Wert von drei Uhren, ah
Ich hatt' schon immer Kraft in diesen Venen
Sie trat im Kindesalter auf, so wie Justin Timberlake
Attraktive Babes, ich hab' glattrasiertes Face (ah)

Rinderrouladen ist das helal oder nicht?

Jeder Rapper hofft, dass ich nie mehr ein Soloalbum bringe

Hat südländischen Touch wie die Nafris vom Dom

Wo sie rumliegt und in Mund kriegt wie 'ne Zahnarzt-Patientin
Wenn sie täglich tausend Schwänze in den Rotlicht-Straßen bläst
Bekommt sie vom Boss als Belohnung eine Audemars Piguet
Nicht aus Kollegialität, sondern fürs Zeitmanagement

Kölnmusik Big Band,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it

Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2006

Down from the window pane

As the psychiatrist said
There's something wrong in my head

And hide my face away
When I roar it's not to you, at all
Oh no, all I want to do is start to fall

It's all the same, there is no way
No stopping me from getting on top
'Cause I'm the top star
Far from the place where there is space

I was the oldest and responsibility
was so immense, the tension, we'd disagree

Told me 2 hang on hugged me tight

tryin' 2 open me up

The years I spent in depression this is my confession
thought bout endin' it sometime
But the second that u crossed my mind
I knew I could never leave u

There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something going and to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift though I don't know where

And when we're alone seems there's nothing to say
I bring up a topic and you push it away
You say that you do but I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me

Are we an item or are we just two
I need some commitments all I ask of you
Your lifestyle can change
Don't be 'fraid what you think's in store

I know what's on your mind you've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintances what's there to choose
You won't get too deep even though I'm worth so much more

So think about it carefully

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

If that's how you want it; that's how it'll be
There's no use in trying or making you see
That love don't come easy you don't know what it's about

To get things together won't take any pain
Don't need to see or hear from you ever again
From this day on listen but no more
Please count me out, and you know what I'm talkin' about

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I know now's the time that I went to find something new
You know it's your crime that I'm out to find someone too","I Beg Your Pardon (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden) [12"" Remix][*]",1989
Kon Kan,"Since you've been gone
I sit alone and watch the same old screen
I carry on
It doesn't matter what it is a sin
I just feel the need to hide away
As I loose myself in Saturday

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

I call you up
[Sorry, I'm not home right now, but you can leave a message]
But all I ever get is your machine
I know you're there
What make you think it could be just a dream
Do you feel the need to run away
Are you searching for a better day

Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

How many times changing my mind
How many days wasted away [Wasted away, ooh]
How many words, what will it take? [What will it take, ooh]
How do we work out this mistake [Aaah]

Yeah I admit that I'm at fault 
But no, you've done it too
You gotta open up your eyes
Why can't you see it from my point of view, I want you to
Why do we tell each other lies?
I thought you knew it when I said 
that I would call last night
I couldn't find myself a phone

Can you tell me, am I right?

Don't try to tell me I'm the one who's making our mistakes
And that I'm causing all the pain
I told you once before you gotta learn some give and take
Or was my talking all in vain

Oh there may come a day when I can give my soul about
Right now I need my space and time
I'll give you everything one day you know I will somehow
I'm gonna hold on to my pride

I see you want me to walk
You see there's no room for talk
Standing out in the cold
You got me feinin' and gawking
A fool is what I'm feeling
But see baby that's fine 
I bought some blue suede shoes this time
To do some stepping
And do some stomping
Hanging out with the guys and the girls, do some romping
Dance and play and shout and everything's cool
You put a boot in your mouth fool

[Are you ready boots?]
[Start walking]

Wish I'd known that someday soon he'd long be gone
So, I will try
To remember the end, the day I said so long my friend

They go by many names
Mother, father, brother, son
And the tears begin to swell
Tears I dare not fight

'Cause now I'm alive
I'm taking my first breath
Oh I'm alive
And this time I won't forget

Now I'm alive
I'm taking my first breath
Oh I'm alive
And this time I won't forget

Oh I'm alive
And this time I won't forget",This Time I Won't Forget,2014
Kongos,"So long my friend, my foe, my love, my pain
The road's calling out my name
Dreaming of La Boheme
Maybe I'll go to Barbizon
Or see a girl before she catches cold and she's gone
Or maybe I'll just travel on
Travel on

So long my flame, my warmth, my fear, my fight
The road's calling again tonight
Dreaming under street lights
Maybe I'll catch a train to Rome
See the world until I can't go on
Then maybe I'll come traveling home

'Cause when the road takes it's toll
And these cities come and go
Filled with people I don't know
You'll be in my heart
And I'll dream of where you are tonight.

And when the years pass us by
I wonder if we'll cry
For losing so much time
For moments we may miss
For the love that still exists tonight

Maybe I'll go it all alone
See the world and make my way back home
Or maybe I'll keep traveling on",Traveling On,2014

Head on my shoulders spinning
Low light, passing through people
From room to room, womb to tomb
Got to reunite and break some bricks like '86
And if I lose my mind
I don’t mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind

You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head

Konkrete,"Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even going say the motherfucking rest
But you know
We can talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some fresh new shit

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Riding it like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playing rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rapping lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by giving hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we making noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's going drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspanielle in your poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete and Big Boi beating through your Speakerboxxx

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Ludacris, yeah I keep a glock, in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, cranking the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
""So here he is, get the fuck on the ground""
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you want to romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
Been a while, it's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred tho, bitch, diamonds shimmering
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, over throwed
Now we got seven more points on the board, for sure
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we going show it to your ass
""You're a champion"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre""
I say ""people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay""
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We just split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spitting it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quitting

Oh - sicherlich kein allzu edles Leben,
nie perfekt und immer zwischendrin,
nie gefeit dagegen zu versinken, abzuheben,

uferlos.

Das geht nicht ohne Risse,
ohne Narben, ohne Falten,
und da entrÃ¼stet sich so mancher brave Mann.
Doch will ich mich halt weiter selbst
erfinden und gestalten,
auch kotzt mich diese Bravheit meistens an.

Oh - sicherlich kein allzu braves Leben,
manchmal ohne Ziel und ohne Sinn,
hab mir sicher oft zu viel gegeben,
aber immerhin:

Heute mein Lifestyle 2.0
Und dein Leben, dafür würde manch anderer sterben
Und ich schwör', ich bin dankbar für alles
Aber wenn der Himmel nicht reicht, will man Sterne
Ein Konto, das platzt, ein Haus in der Ferne
Und nur noch ausverkaufte Konzerte
Jeden Tag geb' ich Gas, damit noch mehr von mir bleibt
An dem Moment, in dem ich sterbe, als paar Knochen in der Erde

Mein Bruder war ein guter Junge mit dem Herz am rechten Fleck
Einen Hang zur Gangster-Scheiße und keinen Wert für das Gesetz
Aber Liebe für die Gang, leider auch für schnelles Geld
Doch mit dem Licht kommen auch die Motten und fressen dein letztes Hemd
Wenn die große Nummer zu 'ner Zahl hinterm Komma bricht
Meiden sie das Sonnenlicht
Es kommt, wie es kommt, also komm mir nicht
Mit, „Du verstehst!“, denn du verstehst hoffentlicht
Dass du nicht verstehst, was meine Sorgen sind
Auch im Sommer sind die Nächte für ihn weiß
Beide Hände kalt vom Schweiß, nach gefühlten achtzehn Lines
Kommt die Maske auf's Gesicht, Wohnungstüren brechen ein
Beute wird getauscht gegen Beutel voll mit Stein'n
Heute in sei'm Rausch wirkt der Teufel auf ihn ein
Es zieht Lebenszeit vorbei in ei'm eingerollten Schein
Jeden Tag bete ich, er kommt sauber wieder heim
Und hoff', der kalte Engel gibt ihn wieder frei

Welche Namen sie so kennen, ja, das hat man halt davon
Familie über Gang, Gang über Leute, die dich sofort Bruder nennen
Und zu den Bullen rennen
Sie hassen die Verräter, doch lieben den Verrat
Damals war ich Täter, doch hab' niemals ausgesagt
„Bleib immer am Boden!“, hat mein Vater gesagt
Irgendwann muss hier jeder für die Taten bezahlen
War zu klug für die Anklagebank
Shotgun im Schrank
Schüsse in die Luft und wir lassen es knallen
Zwischen Dreck und die Waren, die vom Lastwagen fallen
Haben Lasten zu tragen, lassen uns nichts sagen
Wird es ernst, heißt es immer noch Mann gegen Mann
Suchst du Stress, siehst du hier rot
In meiner Welt gab es nie ein Verbot

Ich will springen, doch auf meinen Schultern liegt die Welt
Es macht einen kalt, wenn man zu lang hier hängt
Man bangt um den Rest Empathie, doch verpasst den Moment
Diesen Frust, der uns bremst, nicht in Papers zu verbrennen
Doch weil die Zeit leider rennt, vergessen wir zu schnell
Nur ein ganz klein bisschen zu bewahren für uns selbst
Doch alle meine Tränen weint schon ein anderer Mensch
Ich seh' Legenden langsam altern
Meine früheren Idole bei den kleinsten Hürden scheitern
Denn das Gift in den Venen macht die Beine lahm

Zwischen Pennern, die mal Gangster waren, in Chefetagen dealten

Soll da Luft sein, denn Träume sind wie Mücken
Auf der Autobahn, zerplatzen an der Scheibe eines andern
Wollen mit aller Kraft rüber auf die gute Seite
Doch wie sollen wir hoffen, wenn von tausend maximal einer ankam?
Echte Werte sind wie Bien'n, sie sterben aus
Und die guten Vorbilder leider auch
Alle wollen hier raus, jedes Mittel ist erlaubt
Das Gewissen schlägt man taub mit dem dichten, weißen Rauch

So viel hier draußen, was du nicht siehst
Ich reiß' deine Augen auf und du ziehst
Einen tiefen Atemzug aus meiner Stadt
Jeder macht, was er kann oder muss, um zu überleben
Aber dieser Druck, der sich aufbaut, Hass, der sich aufstaut
Kennt leider kein Ventil
Viele von ihn'n schwimmen mit der Fackel in der Hand
Durch die Dunkelheit der Nacht in 'nem See aus Benzin
Betäuben ihre Sinne in dem weißen Rauch
Die Steine eng, Kapseln machen sie taub
Träumt der weiße Nachschub sich aus
Dann fliegt schnell mal eine Faust
Wegen einer Frau oder wegen einem Blick
Einem falschen Wort oder wie du sprichst
Über andere zu reden, mach lieber nicht
Und am Ende kümmert man sich besser nur um sich
Sag mir, was bleibt dir, wenn du keine Batz in der Tasche
Oder vor deiner Tür einen Benz hast
Ohne Familie, was ohne Liebe?
Na, dann bleibt nur der Respekt, Mann
Versteh mich nicht falsch, aber ist so
Unten hat man leider nix
Also gib jedem seinen Respekt
Und man gibt ihn dir zurück, ah

Alle wollen Respekt
Aber selber keinen geben, denn dann nimmt man deinen weg
Wird man zu frech, macht es click-click-brrt
Und die Schüsse sind echt und dann ist Krise
Es geht um Respekt, dann herrscht auch Frieden
Respekt muss man sich verdienen
Respekt heißt nicht zu kriechen
Aber lässt dein Ego nicht zu hoch fliegen

Der Himmel in grau, wäscht den Dreck von meiner Haut
Nur an Tagen wie diesen brechen meine Wurzel den Beton wieder auf

Warum tut es heute noch viel mehr weh als sonst
Mir war doch klar aus welcher Richtung der Dolch in meinen Rücken kommt
Rennen fällt schwerer, meine Beine stecken fest im Beton
Jedes einzelne Wort in meinem Kopf klingt nur noch nach traurigen Songs
Die Mauer wächst, der Panzer schließt sich weil zu viel einfach zu viel ist
Dunkelgrau meine Gefühle wie der Himmel an Tagen wie diesen
Der Kragen ist zu eng und jeder Atemzug schwer
Das Stechen in meiner Brust wird von mal zu mal mehr
Ich will nur weg, vergiss den Rest, wieso halbvoll, denn das Glas ist leer

Denn nur noch ein Wort von dir, alles hier eskaliert
Alleine deine Art und die Weise wie du redest Dicker
Lässt einen seine Kontrolle verlieren
Purer Hass, Dämonen von früher werden wieder wach
Ich gönne jedem seine Sache, aber deine macht mich krank
Ich bin immer ruhig, viel zu lang' hab' ich gefressen
Hab nie gehört, auf dumme Schleimer und die Neider, die mich testen
Einer der Letzten der Bock hat sich zu fetzen
A-a-a-a-aber deine Sorte ist ein Grund, für meinen Hass auf die Menschen
Nackenhaare stellen sich auf, ein Zittern meiner Faust
Und wenn ich dir schon sage dass ich hasse wie du redest, warum hälst du nicht das Maul?
Ich versteh nicht wie du denkst und will nicht hören was du mir sagen willst

Grenzen sind da um sie zu wahren und um zu spielen, hab ich keine Zeit

Ich konnte nicht erkennen, was dahinter wirklich ist
Wer du bist, dunkler Schatten, das unendliche Nichts
Und alles versteckt unter deinem vollkommenen Gesicht

Deine Umarmung ist der Winter und dein Atem kalter Wind
Wo du warst ist alles Eis und wo du bist verwelkt das Leben

Nie genug, aber auch nie zu große Ziele
Mach die Luft in deiner Lunge zu Benzin für die Maschine
Den Neid von so vielen zu Öl für das Getriebe
Neuer Tag, neues Glück, neue Regeln, neue Spieler
Hochfliegen heißt fallen in die Tiefe
Doch ohne große Opfer gibt es großen keine Siege
Wir hören kein Nein, kein das geht nicht, kein der Weg ist zu weit

Denn Flügel wachsen einem nur, wenn den Mut auch hat und springt
Wenn ich stürze, bleib ich liegen, steh ich härter auf und fliege
Nur wer Angst hat vor dem Fall, muss ein ganzes Leben kriechen
Geh nie auf die Knie, der Blick immer Richtung Sonne
Den Anblick speichern für den Fall, dass es mal länger blitzt und donnert
Auch wenn man einmal verliert, muss man besser zurückkommen als man ging
Der Wille macht das Fleisch auf deinen Knochen zu Beton
Nichts ist umsonst, jeden Zentimeter muss man selber gehen
Denn von alleine wird nichts kommen
Motiviert, der Tunnelblick ans Ziel
Denn wann wenn nicht jetzt und wer wenn nicht wir

Wenn sie schreien ich hab es leicht, dann habt ihr leider keine Ahnung
Wir kommen tief aus dem Dunklen entgegen der Erwartung
Hass und Neid, Blut und Schweiß gibt dem Leben nur mehr Erfahrung
Ausdauer ist der Schlüssel für den Ruhm
Es gibt viel was mir fehlt, aber davon hab ich genug

Dicker, wenn es kommt, glaub mir, irgendwann kommt es
Und alles was du warst, steht dann auf deim' Konto
Warst du gestern ein Schwein, bist du morgen dein' Kopf los
Aber warst du ein Engel, steigst du zu Gott hoch
Alles gleicht sich aus
Denn Minus und Minus macht Plus
Und wem zu viel nicht genug ist, hat Frust
Und, Dicker, welchen Weg das Leben mir bereit hält
Es hat einen Grund

Denn wo einer kommt, lässt ein andrer los
Denn neben dem Leben steht auch immer der Tod
Hinter der Sonne folgt auch immer der Mond
Egal was wir tun, Karma ist groß
Wo einer trauert, spendet auch einer Trost
Und wo einer fällt, kommt ein anderer hoch

Ob du lebst wie ein König oder festhängst im Sumpf

Frauen werden leichter, Freunde falscher
Nur du immer reicher, eingesperrt in einem Safe aus Beton
Aus einem Fisch wird ein Hai

Wir kommen ihm entgegen

Aber leider auch oft in die Tiefe

Es macht, dass du lachst, weinst, absteigst, wach bleibst
Gibt dir das, was du immer schon wolltest, nur keine Gefühle

So lange man es teilt, ist man niemals allein
Doch ist diese Zeit irgendwann mal vorbei, 
Wird sogar dein Blut zu deinem Feind
Es ist nicht mehr wichtig, was du kannst, 
Nicht mehr wer du bist, sondern wie viel du hast
Es macht dich immer kälter und stumpft dich ab
Egal wie viel du frisst, du wirst nicht mehr satt
So paranoid, denn jeder will ran an deinem Bunker
Freundschaft erkauft man mit Hundert, Liebe mit Klunkern
Deine Federn werden rabenschwarz und die Seele immer dunkler
Du siehst nur noch Funkeln in ihren Augen
Doch auch alles Papier dieser Welt macht dich nicht unverwundbar

Mir scheißegal, ob du in der Schule oder nur in U-Haft warst
Ich mach' euch gleich, reich, stark, gleich, schwach, gleich, frei
Ich mach' euch alle gleichmäßig high
Es macht keinen Sinn davon zu rennen, denn es holt dich sowieso ein
Ob du willst oder nicht, du wirst jetzt Teil von etwas Größerem sein
Selbst wenn ich geh', schwebst du noch drei Meter über dem Boden

Da ist nur ein Geist, der mich anstarrt im Spiegel

Wie ein Fluch, der die zerstört, die ihn lieben
Er schneidet Wunden in sein Fleisch, die zum Heilen zu tief sind
Doch trotz all seiner Fehler muss Gott ihn noch lieben
Denn nur das kann der Grund sein, warum er noch hier ist
Warum jeder Atemzug ihm neue Kraft gibt
Neuen Mut, wenn sein Rücken zur Wand ist
Wenn alle seine Sünden sich auftun
Zu 'ner Mauer zu hoch, um sie leicht zu überwinden
Was bleibt ihm dann außer der Angriff?
Weil seine Seele zerfressen von Angst ist

Ist auch der Gedanke, dass morgen ein besserer Tag wird, nie zu weit weg von mir
Du bist die Kraft in all unsern Taten, das, was uns Halt gibt
Wie eine Flamme, die uns wärmt, auch wenn es schneit und die Wirklichkeit kalt ist
Nur durch dich hat jeder Kampf einen Sinn, auch wenn man ihn nicht gewinnt

Bist meine einzige Medizin, die mir noch hilft gegen den Ast, der in meinem Bauch ist
Und genau dann, wenn ich dich brauche, die ganze Kraft, die in meiner Faust ist
Du verzeihst noch, auch wenn das Fass lange überläuft
Sogar mit den Messern im Rücken noch immer mehr Liebe als falschen Stolz
Gibst den Glauben daran nie auf, dass die Welt nicht immer nur enttäuscht
Und würdest blind für jemanden in den Tod gehen, wenn er dir beweist, er ist dein Freund
Und egal, wohin ich komm', ich trage dich da, wo mal mein Herz war
Sogar durch Stein auf meiner Brust machst du sein Schlagen wieder hörbar
Keine Wörter, die beschreiben, was du auslöst
In den Menschen, Knochen brechen, aber nie dein' Wille, Schmerz wird ausgeblendet
Jedes Hindernis wird kleiner
Und solange nur ein Funken von dir bleibt, stoppt uns keiner

In der Hood hat niemand Namen, sind gewohnt an all die Narben
Falsche Freunde, falscher Ort, falscher Zeitpunkt, falsche Taten
Er dealt Stuff im Park an bittergrauen Tagen
Er sieht Menschen, die hier sterben, doch darf niemals was verraten (pscht)
Ich hol' die Kohle ran, guck, ich muss nach oben, Mann
Wie ein Berg, den ich bezwing' und die Fahne in den Boden ramm'
Es ist kalt, doch es liegt nicht am Winter
Und auf dem Spielplatz spiel'n keine Kinder
Grausame Welt, Hauptsache, Geld
Hauptsache, keine Aussage fällt
Und mein Herr, wenn wir uns selbst betrügen
Selbst belügen, um mehr zu fühlen
Nichts mehr genügt, wir sind schwer zu führen
Weil wir den Schmerz nicht fühlen, unser Herz ist kühl

Sag mir, warum geben wir ei'm Bruder lieber Gift
Als eine Hand, die ihm hilft?
Sag mir, warum gönnen wir uns gegenseitig nix
Und warum isst der Teufel immer mit?
Sag mir, warum werden wir nicht größer als wir sind?
Warum geben wir uns kampflos hin?
Sag mir, warum lassen wir die Dunkelheit gewinnen?
Denn aus dem Schatten brauch es nur ein'n Schritt
Nur ein'n Schritt

Was passiert ist, nicht einfach für jeden
Du stehst da und wirst umkreist von Hyänen
Den meisten fehlt Anstand
Zeigen nie das wahre Gesicht, weil sie Angst hab'n
Ich wahre mein Gesicht
Sitz' mit falschen Leuten niemals an einem Tisch
Es ist alles, wie es ist
Schnelles Geld auf der Straße, alles ist Profit
Und ich mach' den nächsten Schritt
Handel' nicht mehr mit Gift, hab' mich wieder im Griff
Und ich mach' den zweiten Schritt
Nie wieder Zelle, der Anwalt bekommt nichts
Und ich bleibe wie ich bin
Immer kühl zu den Leuten, weil ich weiß, wie sie sind
Folge meinem Instinkt (meinem Instinkt)
Bleiben stabil, keiner bleibt liegen

Sag mir, warum geben wir ei'm Bruder lieber Gift
Als eine Hand, die ihm hilft?
Sag mir, warum gönnen wir uns gegenseitig nix
Und warum isst der Teufel immer mit?

Warum geben wir uns kampflos hin?

Zwischen Highlife und dem Fliegen
Wenn ich 'ne Einheit mit meinem Team bin
Oder den Wunden, die nach einer Krise nur wieder verheilen bei meiner Familie
Wie ein Baum, die Blätter im Himmel, doch seine Wurzeln gehen in die Tiefe
Feuer und Eis, wir schreien Stille, wir kämpfen nicht, wir führen Kriege
Keine Liebe, die wir geben, im Leben prasseln die Schläge
Auf dich ein wie der Regen, durch den wir gehen
Alle meine Muskeln angespannt, verkrampft, eine Wand, die mit keinem redet
Denn dahinter kämpfen zwei Seelen ums nackte Überleben
Eine will Stille, die andere Sturm, eine Hand reißt ein, was die andere aufbaut
In einem Moment will ich ein Traumhaus und in 'nem anderen nur wieder draufhauen
Ein Trümmer fällt in meinem Inneren unter 'ner Schicht aus Eis, das nicht auftaut
Aber niemals löst das Feuer in meinen Augen sich in Rauch auf

Denn wenn sich der Engel und der Teufel auf deinen Schultern nur streiten, 
Liegt die Wahrheit meist dazwischen
Ja oder nein kennt kein Vielleicht, zwischen Krieg und Frieden ist keine Mitte
Doch mit aller Kraft versuch' im Hirn nur die Stille 
Und in meinem Chaos mich selber zu finden
Flieg' hoch in den Himmel, aber fall' dann hart auf den Boden der Realität
Träume los von Erfolgen unter einem Jahr, aber steh' mir nur selbst im Weg
Drei Schritte vor, wieder zwei zurück, doch hält mich nicht ab davon weiterzugehen
Erst mach' ich mich groß und dann red' ich mich klein, Mann, diese Welt macht schizophren
Doch ich werde stärker, meine Haut härter mit jeden Meter, den wir gehen
Und flüster' den Geistern, die ich rief, in Richtung Wolken mein Gebet
Doch ich komm' klar, kein Problem
Und ein Blick in den Spiegel zeigt mir nur wieder mal ein Fenster zu zwei Seelen

Sind die Tage wieder grau nehm' ich alles hier in kauf, für Familie drück' ich auch ab
Vielleicht kriegt ihr mich am Tag, doch ich habe keine Angst, Blackstar kommt zurück in der Nacht
Ob arm oder reich, ich kenne beide Seiten
Stark sowie schwach, es gibt keinen meinesgleichen
Stelle meine Weichen, sende meine Zeichen mit den Texten, die ich schreibe
Immer noch alleine, wenn ich Grenzen überschreite

In beiden aktiv, mein Geist auf dem Kiez
Sei mein Blut auf dem Beat, mein Cousin muss der Tod sein
Immer echt, beide Augen auf's Geschäft
Aktenkoffer oder Kuhfuß, ich gebe meinen Respekt
Der eine lernt jetzt und wird irgendwo Chef
Der andere in Haft ist für vier bis sechs weg
Wir kommen zurecht, zwischen Crackys und Hustlern
Zwischen nichts mehr zu fressen und barfuß auf Asphalt
Doch auch bei High-Class-Lifestyle, Champagner bleib' ich undercover
Zwischen Quatschen über Ackern mit meinem Vater
Und den Geschichten, die ich ihm lieber erspart hab'

Heißt das nicht, dass es leicht war
Und was denkt ihr, dass ihr seid, dass ihr reinquatscht
Denn ich hab' meine Sachen schon gemacht
Da wart ihr noch verpackt in 'nem Sack und zwei Eiern
Doch Worte sind nur Luft, die ihr ausatmet
Und die, die am lautesten schreien, dass sie gönnen
Sind dann leider wieder nur die, die am wenigsten drauf haben
Außer paar Ausnahmen

Wenn ihr denkt, ihr macht es besser
Lauft mal nur einen Meter in meinen Schuhen
Und ich seh' ihnen zu
Wie sie scheitern und wackeln
Stolpern und fallen, nur bei dem Versuch
Ich hab' es ja so leicht
Dann lauft mal nur einen Scheiß Meter in meinen Schuhen
Aber merk dir gut, nur wer in die Fußstapfen
Anderer tritt hinterlässt keine eigenen Spuren

Schweigen ist Silber, Handeln ist Gold
Entweder nimm die Hand vor den Mund
Oder quatsch mich nicht voll
Was ich gemacht hab' oder machen soll
Entweder hast du einen Cent
Oder noch bei irgendwas Erfolg
Und ich bin mir nicht zu stolz
Von guten Menschen einen weisen Rat zu durchdenken
Doch mir klummt das Blut in den Adern
Wenn ich zuhör', was für Scheiße sie erzählen
Um meine Zeit zu verschwenden
Und letzten Endes machen die Worte nicht den Menschen
Nicht nur immer labern und Jahre verschwenden
Doch nur unter aller größtem Druck
Und selbstlosen Handeln
Formen sich die wahren Legenden
Sie sind die klügsten und härtesten in Texten

Auf der Lauer wie ein Panther, Augen mustern jede Landschaft
Diese Aura wie ein Panzer, ich vertraue keinem Handschlag
Die Stimme, die mich warnt, wiederholt sich wie ein Mantra
Falsche Versprechen sind Heroin, sie lenken den Verstand ab
Das Denken wird verlangsamt
Und die Beute wird berechenbarer, wenn ihr Jäger spürt, wovor sie Angst hat
Jede Narbe, die wir tragen, macht die Haut nur ein Stück dicker
Und was damals schon ein Schnitt war, wird heut nicht mal ein Kratzer
Gute Miene, böses Spiel, wir durchleuchten die Kulissen
Also glaub mir, mein Freund, denn nur eines musst du wissen
Das Gefühl, das wie ein Schauer dauernd hochkriecht an deinem Rücken
Ist ein Wink deines Instinkts, um dich zu schützen

Wie ein Schmied, der nie pausiert, macht er meinen Willen eisern
Schärft die Klinge, die falsche Fesseln durchtrennt, die der Hype macht

Ob sie lügt, wenn sie sagt, dass sie dich liebt

Wie 'n Kescher, nimmt dich in den Schwitzkasten
Und die Hyänen, die darauf lauern, dass sie Schnitt machen
Im Schatten findet niemand seinen Weg
Denn es ist Kopf über Wasser oder leise untergehen
Dann war die Welt mein Problem, jeder Tritt von ihr tat weh
Und irgendwann wird jeder Hund mal aggressiv, wenn man ihn schlägt
Der Kopf geht kaputt, wenn man weiß, man kommt nicht klar
Und eigentlich hat man viel mehr Potenzial
Der Frust staut sich an und fuckt dich jeden Tag ab
Und irgendwann erbrach ich dann immer mein Inneres auf's Blatt

War sie leichte Beute, weil der Kleine war der Teufel
Was Schule, 24/7 high, nix gelernt, aber immer noch dieses eine Lied im Kopf
Ja, er war blass wie milchweißes Fell
So naiv, glaubte alles, was der Wu-Tang-Clan erzählt
Kulturschock in CAB, kannte die Straße vorher nur von 'ner DVD, nicht mal ein Film

Mit Kopfschmerzen hart wie Asphalt, doch ich stapel es bald

Ich dreh' auf für die Jungs, mach' die Scheiße für sie

Dabei wär's einfach, wenn man seinem Bruder nur die Hand gibt

Versuch' mich zu halten, ich spür', wie ich falle
Mein Körper scheint für meine Seele ein Sarg zu sein
Leider wagt keiner einen Blick hinein
König im Dunkeln, die Freude sein Feind

Alle Gefühle nur ausradiert, sie sterben hier
Genau da kann die Sonne leider nicht mehr scheinen, nein

Heute füllen wir unsere Lungen nur noch 
Mit der kalten Luft der Nacht
Denn dieser Druck auf meinem Brustkorb
Macht den Körper zu ei'm knast
Auch ein kalt gewordenes Herz
Schlägt noch im Takt

Jeder macht das was er muss
Und das was er kann
Der Weg von ganz unten
Schweißt uns nur zusammen

Nummer zwei: Verbrenne dein' Schmerz
Nummer drei: Rede dich nicht klein 
Und lasse den Feind nicht in dein Herz
Nummer vier: Bleib' konzentriert 
Auch wenn das Rampenlicht oft ablenkt
Nummer fünf: Ein echter Bruder wird nicht zum Ballast der am Arsch hängt
Nummer sechs: Werd' nie zu frech 
und hab' Respekt auch für die Straße
Eine harte Linke gerade brauch' hier keine großen Namen
Nummer sieben: Echte Liebe ist ein Traum, der selten wahr wird
Nummer acht: Bist du schnell satt, bist du zu schwach um noch zu jagen
Nummer neun: immer dann wen's läuft, nennen sich die schlangen gleich dein' Freund
Nummer zehn: Du musst verstehen, nicht nur weil's glänzt, ist es auch Gold

Got a half zone and a half cut
The white pony, I passed up
Stay cashed up, I gotta do it
Left it in the few that I snatched up
Now I got eighth, ninth wonder 
Stay on top, I don't like under
Get my attention, small chance
Might look your way, for that right number
Got a small set with all vets
Apartment block to the projects
All sick, used to cause wreck
Now bars spit got us on deck
It's that blood sweat, tree snow
All hustle, no sleep, no
Mind your business and keep low
Live and die by that G code
Now we made a name, but fuck fame
I'm just blessed, that my luck changed
I can touch the world, when I jump planes
Reach the hoodlums that run sane
'Cause we a-like, G like, sick, starving that be  your life

And get crowned king when you see the light

Wieder einer dieser Tage
Spüre meine inneren Dämonen, die mich jagen
Weil meine Haut mir zu eng wird Schizophrenie
Denn die Stimmen bringen mich in Rage, ay
So viele Jahre
Immer ein Auge gehabt für die Straße
Aber Träume platzen wie Seifenblasen zwischen Asphalt und zehnter Etage
Das Funkeln in den Augen schon zu lange verloren, aber finden Trost im Bargeld
Von 'nem kleinen Gauner zum Imperium, all in mit einer Karte
Aber alle meine Brüder haben Hunger, müssen essen
Und jeder von ihnen hat Steak verdient
Statt schwedischen Gardinen, halt ich die hoch, denn ich push' mein Team
Aber bin immer wachsam
Denn so viele warten nur darauf, dass man fällt
Doch lass den kranken Rest lieber liegen, denn sie wollen nur an dein Geld
An dein Fame, an dein Hype, Hand an den Rücken, an dein Hals
Deswegen ist und bleibt um mich nur ein kleiner Kreis

Adrenalin, komm' wir schieben schnell ein Whiskey auf Eis
Nebenbei noch Knastworkout in meim' Backstagebereich
Was für kiffen? Der Erfolg macht mich high
Wenn sich die Nackenhaare aufstellen beim Gang Richtung Bühne
Und du hörst wie zehntausend Menschen einen Namen schreien
Doch realer kann ein Traum nicht mehr sein
Verdammt ja, nenn' es Glück und ich sag sicher nicht nein
Doch leider zum allergrößten Teil
Denn auch ein blinder Hund hat diesen einen Tag im Leben verdient
An dem die Sonne nur für ihn alleine scheint
Und ja, wie hell sie für mich scheint

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch

Es begann mit uns im Dunkeln damit mein' ich ganz unten
Da wo die Augen der Dämonen beim Mondschein funkeln
Die Taschen höher die Akten voll
Doch Familie ist, wo die Jungs sind
Damit die Ablenkung stimmt
Dreh den Beat auf und lass pumpen
Wird er rausgehen in den Dschungel
Schon als Kind dann als Junge
Doch raucht jetzt als Mann stillt nur Papier den großen Hunger
Aber wenn die Hände glühen wie Feuer, dann verbrennt da jeder Schein
Die Kohle kommt viel zu schwer, aber geht viel zu leicht
And Handgelenken Tic Tac Toe in rosé gold und weiß
Und der Diamant und nicht der Charakter sind dir noch lupenrein
Ich nehme das Blutgeld von dem Business, kauf' meinen Brüdern neue Nikes 
Und das Geld verbrennt nur langsam auch wenn man es teilt (ja)

So wie das „Amen“ in der Kirche oder dass dein Leben enden wird, Junge
Brüder stechen sich wie 'ne Ghettobitch, Junge 
Sind zusammen damals aufgewachsen, ist ein Zeichen dass die Welt am enden ist, Junge
Literweise Blut klebt auf den Batzen, hingen nächtelang, labbern von Straßen, ja
Ab Tag eins war unser Name laut
Die Vergangenheit hinterlässt Spuren wie vernarbte Haut
Sie verbrennen Scheine für Rolex Uhren, aber können sich keine Zeit kaufen
Du kannst bleiben, kannst hier einkaufen 
Aber eintausend Euros reichen aus und ein Verrückter erschießt dich über einen Haufen
Miese Junkies gehen sicher Stein kaufen und verbrennen ihren Existenz 
Und Frauen gehen raus ihr Fleisch verkaufen für die AMGs (?)
Ich dreh' die Runden, seh' die Kunden
Lassen die, die tief im Schnee verschwunden sind 
Und jeder ist an eine (?) gebunden kurz bevor er so tief in dem Höllensumpf versinkt

Die Air Max tot, aber trugen uns weit weg
Heute im Mercedes AMG, alles Hightech
Was bringt mir die Scheiße, wenn ich darin allein sitz'?
Worte hatten recht, weil sie ehrlich gemeint sind
Versprechen einen Sinn, denn sie wurden gehalten
Doch hier ist die Liebe keinen Cent mehr wert
Denn sie hält nur so lange, wie die Spotlights scheinen
Warum willst du weg von dem Glück, was du hast?
Es wäre perfekt, genau so, wie es war
Ich halt' den Moment fest, solang ich noch kann
Doch er verschwindet im Schatten, geht das Rampenlicht an
Es wird nie sein wie früher, wir nennen uns noch Brüder
Und sehen uns maximal einmal im Jahr
Doch jedes Leid, jeder Gig, jede goldene Platte
Zerschneidet nur weiter das Band

Nicht übel nehmen, denn er will haben, was er nie hatte
Sie kommen, kommen und nehmen, was sie brauchen
Das, was du bunkerst, um groß zu verkaufen
Man kann auch buckeln von zehn bis zehn
Konkurrenten ausstechen und hoffen, dass es bergauf geht
Ganz egal, welchen Weg man geht
Es gibt immer einen, der durch Ambition ein Level drauflegt
Denn Brot und Wasser auf dem Tisch machen Augen nicht satt
Und am meisten begehren wird der Mensch immer das, was er grade nicht hat, bis er es hat

Einer schaufelt sein Leben lang auf Baustellen Sand
Andere einen Tunnel einen Monat in die Bank

Doch es überzeugt, es bezahlt und es schmiert
Es lässt Leute schweigen oder kooperieren

She cheers me up when I feel alone
And that's why baby I've got to let you know

I remember 
Not to long ago 
I went to a theater
And I saw the Kool and The Gang Show
I always wanted
To fit into a band 
To sing my songs
And become a bad piano playing man
So hear I am 
In this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess I
I guess I

Kool & the Gang,"(Here we are in this day and age still loyal to the state of confusion. Why
is it only tragedy when harmony unites the people of this nation. We must
learn to break this cycle of hate and disrespect among our brothers and
sisters and we must stop asking the question: why? Start spreading the
message of one love)

[Verse 1: J.Flexx]
My heroes catchin 3 or 4 through they corridor
They blast on em, hit the gas on em, last call
A bullet make a life shatter like a glass jaw
Look like the devil gettin just what he axe for when the gas draw
They want to blame it on the gangs but it's a bigger picture
'cause why we're steady dyin somebody gettin richer
Listen to what I'm spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain't all about the red and blue
'cause some many's corporations is gangstas too
They rub you out in a minute gettin greedier and greedier
Buyin out major labels and pimpin the media
Orchestratin beef between the west and east
Kill a superstar, blow up his next release
We got to put them straps down 'cause if you let them stay dead
Every death in black America is gang related
Yeah

[Chorus:]
A change is gonna come to our lives (A change to come)
I'm not sayin it's wrong (A change to come)
We've reached a point and we have to decide (A change to come)
if we should go on (A change to come)

[Verse 2: Tenkamenin]
I'm fallin from the heavens screamin out ""Lord please!
Let me go so I can check up on my younger seeds""
To show em right so they won't reach these penetentiaries
'cause over the years that's what them folks want us to turn out to be, and
just release you
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
hang on the corner, smoke my weed and try to sell my drugs and show no love
In '97, all this had to change
So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it's all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that's on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
""Please let me make it through this struggle"" even though it's hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro's
Keep it up and best believe you, I will finally see it's gang related
So we best to let the killin cease, now rest in peace

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: J.Flexx]
Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
before I wise up and stop lettin the devil tempt me
Usin materialism to jealousy to pimp me
Live by the gun, die by the gun, to put it simply it's gettin shady
They got me mad like rabies, headed for Haiti's
Sellin they soul for a Mercedes and fly ladies
All this dirt being done ain't gang related
We got to take our former glory why'all, reinstate it

(People are in trouble in America. As a matter of fact, people are in
trouble throughout the Earth. We have returned into a force of death and
destruction on ourselves. We were never meant to be trapped in this
darkness, but there's always light in the midst of the darkness if you know
where to find it. Nothin is impossible. If you know who you were you
wouldn't want to be anything but who you are. We have one change but one
cause and that's to frown one love)

In my life there was a chance
To believe in someone new

[Incomprehensible] saw a light and she promised her child
To carry him through and give birth on that side
In a dingy hotel on the north of the line
She gave birth to a boy and went into the lie

To a place on the map we are dying to find
There’s a bill on the books from the ancestor’s law
It is written in code yet it speaks to us all

They had a built up this world from the sweat of his brow
Now he dreamed of his seed growing strong over time
No child of his will live south of the line

Eagle told men when he showed at the shore
That a promise was written and sealed in her core

You can call it your own but you can’t own a lie

When you think what’s the use

With each new day one thing will stay the same

Would the grass have been greener time and again
‘Coz your circumstance keeps bringing you down

To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

Oh, this pain I feel
Coincide with you not here
Now and then that I see it so clear
I wanna say I miss you, my dear

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I’m sorry for the night I’ve been astray

So sorry, babe, so sorry, babe
‘Coz I need you, need you in my life, my life
So sorry, babe, so sorry, so sorry, so sorry
I never meant to hurt you, sorry, babe, i need you, babe
I love you, baby, I want you, baby

What a lovely feeling, music so appealing
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I
When we start the dancin', we begin romancin’
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I

Steppin’ into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Music is so thrilling and she is so willing
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I
Every beat’s a love song, nothing here can go wrong
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I

Steppin’ into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Every night we go out and dance
There’s a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin’ into love
Steppin’ into love

Every night we go out and dance
There’s a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin’ into love
Tonight, tonight, tonight

The beat is gettin' stronger, we dance a little longer
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I
Steppin’ in a small way, says I love her always
Steppin’ into love, my baby and I

Steppin’ into love tonight
Steppin’ into the love, whoa, tonight

Every night we go out and dance
There’s a chance to increase romance

And we know every beat is love
Steppin' to love

Kool & the Gang,"People need people

Just yesterday our nations became as one
To save those countless victims a way
Still the east is full of bombs that blast away
And children lose their innocence their heart to pray

Heroes come and heroes go, they save the day
But who will come and wash their tears away
Seems like Heaven cries all day
Still too low for zero, Heaven feels the pain

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Yes, it seems like Heaven is ten zillion miles away
When we go through earthly war, nature's [Incomprehensible]
Still I know that God loves each and every soul
The children of the one eternal flame

Skin of bronze, hair like [Incomprehensible] you turn away
The color of the skin still the judge
Christian, Muslim, Jew and Buddhist, they live and pray
Forgive ‘em Father, they know not what they do this day

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Hold on to your faith
Oh, as the world spins around
Just believe even though
That you’re, you're below zero

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low

Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
