Fler,"Simes got that secret sauce

Sup? Sup?
Turned on the TV this morning
Had to shit on about
'Bout living in the violent, the violent world
Started thinking man
Either they don't know, don't show 
Or don't care about, what's going on in the hood
Doughboy! 
Got some blow, got some rock?
Get the fuck out my face!

Ich bin ein Doughboy ein Leben lang (Doughboy)
Kommt mir nicht mit euern Regeln an (nein, nein)
Der Dom-Dom Pérignon ist teuer (brrt, brrt)
Ich geb' ein'n Fick und brech' den nächsten an (fuck, fuck)
Brrt, brrt, bis dein Herz stoppt (pow, pow)
Anabol ist mein Nährstoff (Anabol ist mein Nährstoff, Digga)
Bomberjacke wie die Air Force (pow)

In Miami wie ein Delphin (brrt, huh)
Früher Waffe an der Shell ziehen (pew, pew)
Wenn deutsche Rapper denken, bei ihn'n läuft (pow)
Bei mir war '06 schon break-even
Bin ein Millionär, ein Offizieller (ah)
Nenn mich John D. Rockefeller (wouh, wouh)
Nach jedem zweiten Satz ein Inshallah (brr, brr)
Doch du frisst heimlich deine Mortadella (mhh)
Flizzy ist ein Original (jaja)
In der Louis-Bag die forty K (pfew, pfew)
Ich kille die Hermès-Boutique (pew, pew)
Du machst gar nix mit dem Gucci-Belt (gar nix)
Machst mir einen auf Kanye West (haha)
Doch Kanye West hat kein Vollbart (boy)
Ich hab' mehr Style als deine Fashionblogger (jaja)
Auch wenn ich shoppen geh' bei Walmart (puh, puh)

Bomberjacke wie die Air Force (wouh)

Krass wie jeder Rapper heut am Biten ist (krass, Digga)
Wird mal langsam Zeit für etwas eigenes (haha)
Diese Vögel, alles meine Plagiate (alles, alles)
Keine Platinplatte, ich bin Platin auf der Straße (wouh)
Ich bin lebenlang ein Outlaw (lebenlang)
Bestsellerautor (ahah)
Traumhaus, Traumauto, Traumfrau (ja)
Ronaldo-leben, Traumtor (Traumtor)
Mein Merchandise ist ihr Nachthemd (wouh)
Wie sie meinen Namen schreibt mit Akzent (ahaha)
Wir hören dabei The Weeknd (Weeknd)
Ich ficke sie wie Superman, nicht Clark Kent (oh)
Investiert in Gucci ist das Kapital (Kapital)
Nicht in Fake-Gucci-Material (nein, nein)
Du kaufst dir nur das Phonecase 
Die Shoppingmeile ist mein Areal (brrt, brra)

Ich bin ein Doughboy ein Leben lang (Doughboy)

Highlevel-Ignoranz, Hater labern weiter Bullshit (wouh)
Dieses Leben ist ein Déjà-vu
Denn jede Nacht nehmen mich die Bullen mit
Hab' nur Ärger mit der Ex-Bitch
Weil das alles meine Schuld ist
Highlevel-Ignoranz, denn ich bange weiter Fullclip (ey)

Als ob mir jemand was geschenkt hätte
Krieg' vom Leben einen Denkzettel
Weil ich hier und jetzt den Trend sette
Krieg' ich später 'ne Gedenkstätte
Dieser Flizzy scheint wie LEDs
Wie Las Vegas auf die AMGs
Häng' mit drei, vier Modelschlampen
Sippen drei, vier Chardonnays
Flizzy zeigt euch, wie man Business macht
Und ihr macht daraus 'ne Wissenschaft
Guck, der Lambo passt zum Ziffernblatt

Macht wieder nicht, was die Fans wollen
Dieser Flizzy macht kein Afrotrap
Ist kein Fashionblogger – ApoRed
Ich werd' heiser von dem Rumschreien
Flizzy ist nicht kompatibel
Meine Interviews mit Realtalk
Oder die Bundesliga-Sonntagsspiele
Trag' die Knarre im Hermés-Belt
Bleibe clean in dieser Dreckswelt
Die Gucci-Jeans wird gewechselt
Maskulin, Baby, Sex sells
Ich bin underrated, overdressed
Piss' auf Rapper wie ein Drogentest
Dass dein Baby heute bei mir ist
Ist kein Zufall, ist Naturgesetz

Und 'ner Kette am Hals, so wie Sklaven-Neger
An meinem Körper nur Versace-Leder
Und ich pushe mehr Kilos als Wagenheber
Authority Whiskey auf Modus geext
Töte Rapper für den Promoeffekt
Kugeln sind heavy, das Schießen ist easy
Tret nicht auf Fler seine Yeezys
Glaub mir, die Sneakers sind wertvoll
Jalil macht Swish und kein Airball
Mach' einen Call, wenn ihr klären wollt
Komm' in der Nacht wie ein Werwolf
Schieße nur Blei und kein Ben & Jerry
Ficke nur Bitches wie Halle Berry

Nein, Mann, das kann nicht gesund sein
Noch immer die Pisser von laut.de
Kriegen jetzt Schwanz in den Mund rein
Die Bullet ist Blei und kein Häagen-Dazs
Schieße auf Rapper, kein Tränengas
Damals mit Maske in EDEKAs
Wusste schon damals, wir regeln das
Kapuze tief wie das Mercedes-Gehäuse
Von Engeln gesegnet, doch red' mit dem Teufel
Häng' in der Großstadt mit Schwerkriminell'n
Wenn du Stress machst, wirst du beerdigt für Geld
Vermummt und maskiert wie beim Maskenball
Reiten bei dir ein, nehm' dann die Kasse ein
Lass' euch alle hungern wie zur Fastenzeit
Ficke deine Bitch, mach' sie zum Wasserfall

Nur Schützen im Team, so wie Barça-Spieler
Gang, Gangslang, das weiße Pulver
Alle auf Stress aus wie dreißig Ultras
Narben am Körper, die Stories erzählen
Von Südberlin bis zu den Hollywood Hills
Und wieder back hier nach Kreuzberg
Einziger Rapper, der Royce fährt
Wo kommt nur das weiße Zeug her?
Ja, es ist weiß, doch ist goldwert
Du hast die Gun, doch bist nicht ready
Hast keine Kugeln wie MC Flurry
Ich pass' in den Lambo nicht rein, Junge

Flesh,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

The glass sounds, stop and ya oughta wait in the ground

Insane and it drive you crazy
Maybe my niggas willing to settle for somethin'
If nothin', dumpin' if you're tempted to play
I'm a real true, you're a real true
And act other niggas can't groove
Gotta get 'em on the grind, so make the move
We gonna put this shit together forever
Let's do this, nigga
Feel it, drop a nigga, this sidekick
Stop in to get your ready-to-ride trigger, peel it
All the brothers that fly to get the enemy fried
Tonight you die
You really think that you got it?
Better break it, get ready to go
On this mission for the Land, and I'm murder 'em all
Roll, to try to save out souls

And the people that be thuggin' it often Cleveland style
Look, me and my niggas, we strangle and theivin', now
Leavin' out, prayin' for the Northcoast
My city behind me, watch my back
All of my niggas on the Clair, show love for me
Pass the weed, (get you hype) on the corner like it was
Wherever I roll through the hood, givin' up ?, hit the pound, stay real
Nigga where the money be, I'm a be breakin', nigga
Let's and got chill with my bills, sellin' herb with my thugs everyday
Let me show you the way we parlay 
On the corner where the niggas see yay
Drugdealers and killas all day
Indeed, always roll with my Hustla'z, 
Tre, II Tru, and the Shifters, Afta Maff, and
Niggas come and get some, hit th blunt of
Headed straight for the very top
Niggas crept on ah come up, and it'll never stop
To my family , I gots to give 'em props
Still lettin' off shots to the Double Glock
And I crept and I came in this thug game, man
For the love of mo' money
Niggas in this bitch, you gonna remain a thug, what?
Any my people still hungry
So here we swerve to the curb, hit that herb, hit that nerve
And I'm down to serve and splurge
Fuck around and get burned
Ya better learn

[Chorus]

And ever since I was a youngsta thugsta puttin' it down
Always hustlin' to make a way
Nigga put up with the phases, made it, went through mazes
And I got all my fuckin' pay
Really want to try me, howl with the Fifth Dog
Pick up the sawed-off, nigga done stalked 'em
Make 'em look down the barrel, nigga pick up the shell
Off ya to hell or what else it costin' 'em
Chalkin' 'em, playa hater when ya try to put a stop to me
See it in your destiny, and we know it ain't never possible
But they keep at it to try to get it next to me
Arrestin' me with whip, pole, 
Neck chain if you gonna bang my brain with sticks
Bricks, stones ain't strong enough to break 
And shatter my bones that I swang
I see ya roll with gang, clang, yeah, I'm a catch you G's
Niggas hang in the ""Heart of it All"" with the Family
When I bang, nigga please (oughta) chill with my niggas everyday

Or whatever you need
We can fix ya
Did you now
Let's take a ride
Want to see a playa fall tonight?
Keep a can you run up fast
And then a nigga really lost his life
'Cause I never had time for the pettiness people

Flesh N' Blood,"Ah, somebody say he shouldn't say a stuff like that
(Flesh -N- Bone 5th dog style)
Well, we all say a stuff like that
Here,the problem is a lot of people think that
God don't know what's going on in the world here
Do you know some, some attention! attention!! listen attention
They asked some students in a major eastern university
This trues talk
They asked Coastal maiden eastern university
The question was
Do you think that God understands reggae?

And the overwhelming majority of these students said no
God doesn't understand reggae
There was blindness in menace

Now loom alliance
Squash, splash it blast it
Flame it stain it, cock it knock it
Win that, dash and daz tripping with me
Thing out- thing out, thing in, thing tint
Thanks bang it, bang bang
Flesh-Bone then got it, shoot
Hoo-pound shot it, shot it
Lay, sprayed it
Dream of whom, roof top niggas
Fuck around un-cooked tough niggas
Execute your niggas
Turn bone shoot your niggas
Yours is silence
Don't need no more violence
Moving in silence, moving in silence with violent intentions
No public lectures which is in him isn't entering
Pistols entering
Missiles split entering
Hollow tips losing the gin, I loose in sneaking
I've been waiting gotta give my damn
Pop the world war 2 like Warren pick
Took lil' beat and that's all I'm taking
Gotta holler at my folks
Get it popping nigga
From every coast hoe
Mo bodies be dropping nigga
To strap the chrome
Pick up the microphone
World to pound be it unto def-jam, east to west

Come hang when you find them insane
All my cheese in tea

When they give peace to me
When you see me in the street

Me giving up struggle with the man that stares
And I am the I am that label I grind, understand
They pose my damn mo master plan
Mo thugs my mighty clan I'm rowdy by nature
Fellow G bring it in S.C.T
My city falling get that G falling in
Plead Carli kick it with the D.P.G
Causing destruction
Buckers they come rapping slugs (sh)
For show pope, po-pull up
Strictly ball up and bullets buck pow buck
Get them up we hanging thug swinging
Just doing my thing and he also telling
Never no tell him when I'm bailing
No trailing him, kill him if he smells
Whatever he has task steady kick
Snatch you by, catch you by surprise nigga
Niggas you choose a side
Got niggas high, niggas is excited
Niggas united, cause we taking don out
We choking up burn sticky
Roll with me give you, feel me
Blunt sunk wreck, go with the bad ass spliff
Guess who's this 60's thug cyber chill
Not about all my paper
Not to get in it's my family
It's all of a kind naked ends
And this is the way we get in
So feel it, couple thugs pay the turn
With the nigga clown for the door
Milk for my thugs, for dog pound
Niggas be blinded
Bang with the thugs that's feeling fine
Called your money and let us pull it down, so laugh
Any body with peace squash shoulder me, choke the mask
So rap from coast to coast, keep us dog pound

So serving that seize fire mystic come try

(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul) 
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up

Gettin' my hustle in every day
Each day, when I would get on my knees and pray
Everyday faced with all kinda playa hation
Why they want to make my sanity tighten
Pray, hey, hey, hey, and I got a bueatiful family
A lovely wife, and my little pretty daughter 
And I got two sons, handsome just like me
So I count blessing, after each blessing
Every last blessing I learned a lesson
I didn't realize my blessings keep me from stressin'
Jesus came, and died on the cross
To save us from our sins, our sins
The kingdom of heaven's at hand
How much to repent to get in
Again and again I'm sendin' my praises up above
And I don't know when I'm entertainin' angels 
So I gotta show more love
Gotta honor my mother and father with all my heart
My little brothers Steven and Stewart
We don't let demons break us apart
Yeah, you know that's a no-no for sure
I can put it on my soul
I can even put it in mode
And run the little seconds down the road
I'm ready to go
Steady rollin', leavin' these strangers
If the whole world would end tomorrow
Tomorrow just might be the end
So wait for the Lord and follow

Now, tell me what you've been up to lately
Situations steady come on the daily, no
It don't really surprise me
It don't amaze me, but it do drive me crazy
Demons, they keep tryin' to fade me, and it's so evil
All they want to do is aggrivate me
Trip, and I flip, don't make me
See even when i'm not lookin' for trouble
Trouble, it seem to come find me
That's how it is when you live in the limelight
But I don't worry, put it all behind me
Gotta get down, way down, stay down
Satan up under my foot
Gotta rebuke, and recite the scriptures from my holy book
That's when it straight shook
Look at the prophecy comin' down in history
Still it ain't no mystery, can't let it repeat
Good's gonna demolish evil
What a meraculous, wonderful victory
Ooh, yeah, Armageddon waitin' for the moment
When the lid pop, when it goes down, don't be sleepin'
Cause it'll creep on us, send a thief in the night
Watch out, wake up, stay woke
And gather more faith in Jesus, lead us
Get ready to do the will of God
So that he can keep us from the wrath of firey brimstones
Stay strong and hold onto your faith
And it won't greet you, yet meet you, deciet you
We're leadin' and walkin' through heaven's gates

Chorus

Our father, which art in heaven, hollow would be thy holy name

Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep

And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up 
Hope that he saved a place in heaven

When I grab the gun for homocide
Well you know I'm about to hoo-lah
I never catch you sleeping
And I'mma pop the clip
Put it between your eyes when I should die
Need six feet in a ditch like a bitch
Just avoid the clip with the gauge
Nigga must have had a snipper
They came up pop collar
Hollow point tips to the brain
Bug to the bang I'm stuck in this game
Can't get away cause I'm in too deep
Running the street with heats
Never nigga can hang
You might as well get up and bitch defeat
If a nigga don't know way, know it now
Grab your shit cause it's going down
Fuck one time
Cause I'm on the frontline
Popping slugs with my dogs as we going down
Still hold it ground boy
You know what it is
Hit him in the face with a death kiss
Don't know what his problem was
But all I can say is that a nigga had a death wish
Should have messed with the wrong clique
Saw the nigga drop when I felt the chrome click
That's what you give or talking shit
Now you lying in the hospital
What you don't seek
Here come one in the head
Left it brain dead
Got to put it more life support
Living day by day on the edge of the lens
But he didn't realize that life was short
Now Eazy turning your sleep put your heat
My stars as I match and I creep so cold
You are the wrong nigga to fuck with
So fuck with me best believe it

Had to fuck top everybody
With my nigga BG in, just stock all me
Back with the gauge in the double glock party
Hardy round for your head
Nigga what you want? Now you are dead
Blood red, blood red this only sign
Should us select the gun right
This only sign, should us select the gun
You wanna fuck with me?
Sit ain't funny when you lie in the bed
Covered up in a coffin
Motherfucker, what's happening?
Wanna fuck up my nigga like septin?
Mo thug gonna put it down rapping
Motherfucker don't stop kill mo bug
I'm down for the world
For bloody
Everybody wanna see me
Be like me, hear me
But you cannot pull down trek like me
Nigga so I just spray and spray
The king all over your ear drum
Till you start to do bleed, eternally thugs
Mo thug much love, right

Behold, better move so scold
Then it is on to fly
Then it will all haul back to my family
Nigga give a shit today
Put the ding and blood out to book
Keep eternal life there
Choose to never repent and camp on fire
Bullet proof this way
Must you prepare for consequences hanging
Soldier don't go to this section, finna get high
My bullets and brimstones
Should leave me alone but no
Such to address Flesh Bone
Make yourself for the ram of death is on
Honey nothing can try
Not as my turn then go trap all enemies
All enemies under my combat look them
Kill them and collect my local ways
???East 1999??? nigga Saint Claire
Sieving for the body body, check to them
Never no close to tuition
Murder when I'm leaving no track
Not for a maniac, it's a shame
Niggaz that feeling the blind
Niggaz they still gone change
Hang the blind go strangle thugs
Go to wreck with the mix man
Ready for rise to rising indeed
Better wait for love of a Pharaoh nothing more
To the creature churn on
Don't pay money on to sacrifice him high
I say that healing you
None of us thought that go fucking with the 5th dog
Armageddon
Don like a thief
And I can catch you sleeping in the ceiling
Go rock on my court
Stupid motherfucker that heard, that heard
Pull it it's a souvenir, then you'll blow
Niggaz deflect them, put them in glocks
Caught up in knocks
Peeling, stepping him out fucked up

Oh, yeah if I could go back, way back, way back

[Chorus]
If I could go back, way back. 
I swoop that n**** E up in my Cadillac, and we could hit a corner, get a fat a** sack 
I'm checking for ya ladies, where ya at? 
If I could go back, way back 
I swoop that n**** E up in my Caddillac, and we could hit a corner, get a fat a** sack 
Yes, I'm checking for the ladies, where ya at?

Remember that cool a** n****, true thugs, my n****, that G that put me on
Thinking about it, it should'nt go wrong, why would a n**** Eazy-E, he gone 
Never really had a chance to say thank you for giving Mo Thug mo love, and now that you laugh and sing on up above, you gotta be laughing, n****s we set it off multi platinum

Stacking my chips, I'm dropping these hits down every hour 
And I been smoking these weed trees with them sticky leaves
Blaze to the mighty power 
Six deep in the Benz-O, 6-double-O thug stroll to the studio, little Lay, Kray, Biz, Wish, Flesh Here to rhyme so cold, rap flow never heard before

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

[Chorus]

If I can go back, I be me and Stack, hitting, thugging it in drawely 
When all of this rapping was really a hobby 
Rolling in a Malibu, mobbing with Wally
To this day, feeling like yesterday, when it was Bizzy, Flesh, [Wish], lil?Lay, and Kray

We took a one-way ticket to L.A. 
Creeping on a come up, we had to meet Eazy, better believe me  
Them was the good times, dropping them good rhymes, yes indeed 
And you know we put it down for the love of the cheese, for the love of the game, and the real O.G.s
 
For the love of my Cs, I'm a let it be known
Hip hop thugsta, clique tight with the bones 
And a war been on since the first song 
Remember them Northcoast thugstas splitting your dome 

Hit em home with Tha Crossroads
Dedicated to the lost souls  
Bennefit ya, forever we miss ya 
Better believe that well never forget ya 

Take a picture and capture the moment 
On a quest for the best, its victory 
Nevertheless, we stress this history 
Is you feeling me, is you hearing me?

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

[Chorus]

I sending my chrome upside your dome, hater, disrespect my home, n****, lets get it on 
Fifth Dog flipped out, and its on 
Oh no, y'all testing the Flesh-N-Bone, you wrong 

Too many true soldiers set up for murder, stuffed 
Unsolved, and it makes me wonder who really involved in killing our prophets. 
Crossing them off the list, b****es 
So we still on the rise, it ain't no surprise 

Beat us, so violent, rowdy Mo Thug riders 
Eazy said it, real n****s don't die

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In ? in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this ? this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you want to leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You want to diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain
My nigga get down for your thing
And make a change
Pin pass get them up quick
Because it will be
Hear the  destruction coming I say
Hear the destruction coming
You better hurry and do something (hey)

Flesh-N-Bone comin' at ya like this: (Laughing)

[Flesh]
Get 'em off me, in me you're feelin' I get when I'm tryin'
Your spirits get inside of me, blindin' my mind
I get stoned, like in asylum, I put a trap my mental
Get a temper, turn all violent, put a stop on my silence
Get blown, Flesh-n-Bone got the TEC
And it's on for the next, who get mo murda, murda
My Lord, never felt so many spirits all up in my system
Controllin', me listen I want to take 'em, but a nigga stay calm
Yet he lead, he wet, so wet, sweaty palms
Glocks and a bomb, I'm makin' sure that he cracked the whole area
Carry ya body, buried in your front lawn
We're confusin' to you while I'm using you fools
All abused, find us sort of like a mystery
Wonderin' how in the hell you keep losin'
Check how I keep schoolin', peep niggas (made history)
Flip of my tongue and it's over - you hung upside-down by your feet
Fin to send ya swangin', and knew somebody shoulda showed or told
Just a little somethin' shit'll get you strung out
And hangin', and I'll bet that I mangle any person
Strangle any serpent, wantin' to tangle with me
When a brawl goes down, look around at the city - tore it up
But your ass still ready when I hit and see

Mystic spirits all up in my Flesh-N-Bone deep within
One flip of my tongue and you niggas are hung
Too late
Consume in sin

[Flesh]
Fall asleep, fall deep in a nightmare
Wake up and see me standing there at the edge of your bed
Thought it was Freddy, instead it be Flesh
And he holdin' a machete steady drippin' bloody red
But I warned 'em time from time again
Time after time again, I'm a just sit back sip gin
Think on how to ? corner 'em all, consume 'em
And sent them in a murder with a Mack-10
Pack that gat, so them had it
Ready, set, aim, and straight to pull the flame off the temple
People standin' around - 
They wonderin' where did he go to get away from the po-po
Can't fuck with a nigga, man, so pull the trigger - simple bang!
Hear it, feel it ,wicked spirits in the room dance to your doom
When he had to come enter through the room pretty soon
So hell get, assume position, lay down in the tomb gone
I love the way they ?, boy, had his soul snatched from the body
Left the corpse here, struck with an exorcist, possessed him
Had to put him out of misery, get the stiff and no shadow
Nigga got to attack, so many spirits live inside, trip this
All of my mystic spirits, I get ready, make a nigga want to cry

Mystic spirits all up in my Flesh-N-Bone deep within
One flip of my tongue and you niggas are hung
Too late
Consume in sin

In check, learn a lesson by the mastermind, stack

And they all had a fall, hittin' stickin' 211-turned-187
When they hauled it off
Never stop when I'm gettin' my swerve on
Niggas take a fall, and then haven't you heard?
'Cause she takin' shit over, hittin', rollin' dope, bring up ?
Kilo up on your block and serve it, out the strap nigga, hang
Let my thug nuts swang, touch the pavement
Jack them when the ground get too rough pick them up and eruption
20 gauge splitters slug attackin' them in the back if ya go to turn away
Oh nigga, might kill all you fools who ain't worthy

Yeah, real muthafuckin' gangstas
All the way from New York to muthafuckin' Cleveland
Terror Squad, muthafuckas

[Flesh]
I'm (comin') to get ya, comin' to serve a brother
Me fo'-fo' show no one mercy
But I'm off searchin' for those
You're soon to be comin' up missin'
Get at your strip and my niggas talkin' 'bout murder mo
Keep me ? on hydro, blunt flow, (but I take his shit, all of it)
Runnin' with all my thugsta niggas
Better beware when I bail on the Clair
Gravedig, wig splitter, put one in ya
To the woods to ? your body
Right ? by the two of ya, tie the noose knot tight
But my niggas ain't fuckin' the ?, tell 'em not to bang
Better believe we goin' to kill all the witness
So test Flesh, gotta put 'em in check every time
Here we go march in at night
Just picture me thuggin' in Cleveland, deep in the women
Me and my green, come up with that team
So we can put a lot of fiends in the ditch, bleed
Better not sleep or you sleep with that deep
When I pap that chrome
It'll be gone, what you're fuckin' with?
The ever-rollin' Bone to the dome, you done
Flesh-n-Bone off with the gun
Quiet, so how'd they put him a casket?
Why is it niggas want violence?
I'll find him, no competition, listen
Ammuntion, let 'em have it
Can't outlast our Mo Thug niggas, smoke
Now fiend me the bud to gets me buzzed
So what if you hate me?
Keep to yourself or the haters catch a slug
And never know what it was (was)

[Big Punisher]
Here comes the pain, one in your brain frame
Niggas is thinkin' this shit is a game

Go for your guns, son
Let's get it on

Protectin' home, it's only Flesh-N-Bone

[Flesh]
Think I'm a murder, light up a spliff
Better think of sophisticated way to learn
Imitators, it gets me ? that niggas try to be like us
But can't get the hang, bet I hurt the bustas at ?
They depend on us suckas keep watchin'
You better switch and get humble
Keep our shit original, end up like a lot of niggas that droppin'
Glock-glock, double nina, infrared beam
Now die in an instant flash
Get rid of 'em, mister, ? of 'em, yeah
Try to flee and you'll meet your doom, killin' soon
Your ? get tossed to my great dane
They havin' ? handy for supper
What' s worser, don't even want a
Nigga like me to go thick
What the hell, if you really want to suffer
Stop pressin', and now what's the problem?
Niggas start the static
Always with the silver revolver
Bet I solve 'em, hollow point ?, cash and blast
Get it told, didn't feel ? with your soul
Why murder and follow, but told you
Should've slowed your roll for ?
Here I go, here I go, proceedin' to murder
Scribblin' hellified bloody scriptures
When I sneaks the green
I come to the nigga, hear the fat lady sing
It's your funeral, mister
How would you picture the story and them haters endin'
I'm forcin' the pain, bringin' the game to the table
And we able to bump off your label
Mo props to ? Mo Thug we brang, we brang
Mo Thug brang, we brang, Mo Thug brang
I'm feelin' that lynchin' comin' to get you
I'm feelin' that lynchin' comin' to get you
Get out of line, niggas, we come to drop dimes
Get out of line, niggas, we come to drop dimes
Whoever didn't lynch 'em becomes wig split fools, wig split fools
I'll pop and hit you with a millimeter glock, non-stop
With my favorite fuckin' tool, tool
Kingpin and all of you sucka bustas
Prepare to lose, prepare to lose
'Bout time for you ready to die, pow, pow, what am I?
Guess who, so Flesh'll be waitin', anticipatin', ?
Really don't want to fuck the
Cleveland bosses, Cleveland bosses
We done way past gold
Even past platinum, done triple-doubled it
Go look at the stats, can't stand a nigga sellin' hits quick
Don't go lookin' for trouble
If you dare you gonna stare down the barrel of a
Mossy shotty, can't help ya
Never could drop me, but I'm untouchable
Look behind me, find Mo Thug thug posse

[Fat Joe]
For the right price, I put any ? up on ice
So for a green card
Terror Squad will carve 'em up real nice
Send 'em to Christ takin' this life's not a problem
I been robbin' niggas and pullin' triggers way before my album
Drownin' my sorrows in bottles of Olde
Anybody can go, lose your control, end up a John Doe
You didn't know my shit was game tight
The insane type to bust open your brain with a drain pipe
It ain't right, but I don't give a uh
Me and Punisher, contemplate your death like the governor
A red dot to make your head hot
Disgustin' wet spot, blood gushin' out your ? dreadlocks
Blowin' the spot like David Koresh

Come on sly, take a visit to tha heart of it all
Stead it's all good, and no key should
And though you would really wanna leave of me
What you kickin it in tha hood, get adapted,
Capture tha atmosphere, get addicted to me and my homies
Once you care to get amongst my kind
You go'em along of mine, neva front all day long
And you'll need real money makin g'z

Bitch made it known she want to fuck me because I'm a Bone

But I don't want to go to hell.

For more'n I seen ya vision,
And let never fiendin' catch us and a schemin'.
We'll drink fo' tha way yallz are breakin' me pan. (Hey, man.)
We born to tha weed, it would grow,
Didn't know tha Bone'd grown some.
Buckaz gon' keep it right, just home,
And searchin' wit' they hustlin', (no matter.)
Same time, see tha Bone,
They done have a safe place fo' my babies.
Don't murda, brown up, so crazy get'n tha cruel
World, all made up it, like Hades.
Don't make Flesh break down, sign sight, my pine.
I'd hide drug dealaz, I find my started.
Try not to pine in my nine.
I try to stay kind, instead it plus peelin', peelin'
That splif, roll over that, shove it.
Find tha po' po' beatin' down ya do', and did it.
To ya break and ya won't see tha busta faces.

Shit, it ain't nothin' to lose, we get a drop in twos,
Mo's fools do nothin' and I takes my turn,
And passin' it out wit' tha Layzie, lil' Eazy, my mentor.
Keep in, handin' over tha shoes, I go walkin' in,

This Reverend, from heaven,
Just makin' you feel 'bout these problems for Run.
But neva go less, I'm fresh with Flesh.
Tha solution's begun, gotta get y'all, hit y'all
Wit' yo' fellaz, makin' dollaz and cents.
But tha fact that wack rappaz
Be jealous, make this Reverend intense.
I'm flippin, I'm scrippin, I'm rippen'em down;
They be burnin' my church.
No lippin', I'm sippin', I'm tippin' my ground, gettin' first in my verse.
Who got yo' macho, shot yo' kids, creepin' up on yo' crew?
It's kinda hot, y'all got yo' bids, boy, and that how we do.
What's tunnel mind?  It's soldiaz.
I'm bought masterline, at this line.
These bookaz, that welfare line,
And can forget that black on black crime.
We livin', and drivin', and giving them love,
But what they do wit' out heart.
For takin', and breakin', and fakin' them jacks.
Boy, ya tear'em apart.
Just livin' in a world that's so, so cruel.
That's tha tape in yo' deck.
They take our money, rape our women, now come give you respect.

And I believe, a lot of us shouldn't condemn these rappers,
Because if nobody would a told me about God
The church folks would a been talkin' bad about me.

Why, why, why, are we

Wit' a master plan to get rid of a sea, me got crack,
And all these diseases that make us immune,
And ain't it ridiculous.
Look at us strugglin', hustlin';
Gotta make ends meet to pay my bills.
Gotta help, ain't no grub on our grills.
Stuffin' to get to me fillin', that's only fo' real, though.
Still, people feel me,

Controllin' no mass, no more violence, gon' stop it.
Grow up to be coppaz, and I'm proud.
Be keepin' my Lord's watch, and it's no.

Gotta die, gash, ash to dust.

Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane

Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets

Sit relax and never losin' my composure

Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die

So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)

Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa

Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart

Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad

Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)

",If You Could See,2000
Flesh-N-Bone," 

Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes
Flesh be pulling mack hypnotized

[Verse 1]
All said and ditched with the pay dough
Po-po mo fucking mo fo-fo
And letting them fall, then leaving no thug
And let them all know that I'm not to be fucked with
So who's the one used in benzo
Who's the one accused, and another loosed ooh with
So bigger boy numb off the juice
So niggas beware Flesh is out of the doomster
I'm down and needed the test and the clown
Niggas around me they get down
Was housing the nigga just because he thought he must
make Flesh silly-ly kneel down
Now how many get them up quick with this feather harm
How many people can I hold
Mesmerized, then they kick my thighs
But it is my size, don't try
I'm the wise man, I knew who,when you at the land don't you understand
Mister mister, serving that sixth thugsta begging the nigga and the doctor
This shit you can pause if I pocket two
When I'mma playing, come and take an easy quiz
The original S.C.Ts. then they serving our enemies
So what they really want to do
For skitting in you
When the rest of your  homeboys coming to challenge the master
You gotta totally get destroyed
And then be fucked up
Preparing a luck, but still trying to gamble
All of his life when he picking that streph in
So I blew out his camp

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Starving straight out of Cleveland
Receiving the seed that you bubble your swig
And then they get weak
The nigga now turning to buy  you
Making you deaf like a cripple now
Come now pip out the master man ah
Then they serving you
Hitting this switch like a swisha
You don't want to miss this section
Keepin' you open now smokers
I say focused and now nobody expects me from do-boobing this
So po stay down after mine, again I'm doing my thing
Forget it, I'm taking control hoe
Who pull the-the A.K. killing nigga now
But then if he wants sucking fools
Po-po swoop it to do the, shoot the A.K.
Kill 'em all, fuck 'em all recruit umm
In the dissing, call fifth dog
But you can call me on again, letting my sawed-off
Haul up in the killing, Flesh shake to little feel, check it
In a second, put in the wreckable time
How many times man I told you
Never come try to contend with and again
The challenge the got blown up
Guns hanging around call it a showdown now
So you looking for me, I know home now
Hear them coughing telling the bitch that they found him now
You troop when I said and I leave
When I smoke on top of my lawn
Dun dun leaving in this stocker if I pull me gun

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm jerking crossed seas
Then come take over the border
Flesh the international player
Taking my paper chase world-wide
Get for that, choose my nigga, save it
Me now move to Los Angeles aaaaahhhhh
My jelly my bitch and they go pullin' till I dismount
So don't trip when I flip this song
Fifth dog nigga, nodding the don now
Speak sister, recover
Nevertheless you can troop dip rolling with Mo' thug
And the millennium seventh sign
Chiding Bone, don't trust me
Because they dope-farm for the land of leaves
Rebel up wasteland, wasteland none of guilt fools
Found they be live in a ditch
Flesh wants to abuse it
They die fighting for the bloody mess
Get clack-back
See not in the past to sit chief
Who's whip for you? So die fighting
I rely on you digging assassinating
Quicker be the force they be
But the brake-light to the holy fore-head
Killing, me split the scene
Then I collect my green
Heading back-back to the spot
And leaving no trailing cop
Fuck the law, they can not stop me
No so, put them off and they coughing top-drop
You all about my business
Thought they can tag for granted
Kicking my trues, creep on it come up
People take over the planet damn it

[Chorus]",The Master,2000
Flesh-N-Bone," 

[Flesh]
Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul) 
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up

Gettin' my hustle in every day
Each day, when I would get on my knees and pray
Everyday faced with all kinda playa hation
Why they want to make my sanity tighten
Pray, hey, hey, hey, and I got a bueatiful family
A lovely wife, and my little pretty daughter 
And I got two sons, handsome just like me
So I count blessing, after each blessing
Every last blessing I learned a lesson
I didn't realize my blessings keep me from stressin'
Jesus came, and died on the cross
To save us from our sins, our sins
The kingdom of heaven's at hand
How much to repent to get in
Again and again I'm sendin' my praises up above
And I don't know when I'm entertainin' angels 
So I gotta show more love
Gotta honor my mother and father with all my heart
My little brothers Steven and Stewart
We don't let demons break us apart
Yeah, you know that's a no-no for sure
I can put it on my soul
I can even put it in mode
And run the little seconds down the road
I'm ready to go
Steady rollin', leavin' these strangers
If the whole world would end tomorrow
Tomorrow just might be the end
So wait for the Lord and follow

Chorus

[Flesh]
Must you prepare for the Judgment, baby
Now, tell me what you've been up to lately
Situations steady come on the daily, no
It don't really surprise me
It don't amaze me, but it do drive me crazy
Demons, they keep tryin' to fade me, and it's so evil
All they want to do is aggrivate me
Trip, and I flip, don't make me
See even when i'm not lookin' for trouble
Trouble, it seem to come find me
That's how it is when you live in the limelight
But I don't worry, put it all behind me
Gotta get down, way down, stay down
Satan up under my foot
Gotta rebuke, and recite the scriptures from my holy book
That's when it straight shook
Look at the prophecy comin' down in history
Still it ain't no mystery, can't let it repeat
Good's gonna demolish evil
What a meraculous, wonderful victory
Ooh, yeah, Armageddon waitin' for the moment
When the lid pop, when it goes down, don't be sleepin'
Cause it'll creep on us, send a thief in the night
Watch out, wake up, stay woke
And gather more faith in Jesus, lead us
Get ready to do the will of God
So that he can keep us from the wrath of firey brimstones
Stay strong and hold onto your faith
And it won't greet you, yet meet you, deciet you
We're leadin' and walkin' through heaven's gates

Chorus

[Pray]
Our father, which art in heaven, hollow would be thy holy name

Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul)
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up 
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up
(Hallelleja, hallelleja hallelleja
Hallelleja is the highest praise/forever, Amen)

Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth?",Say a Little Prayer,2000
Flesh-N-Bone,"You niggaz better run
When I grab the gun for homocide
Well you know I'm about to hoo-lah
I never catch you sleeping
And I'mma pop the clip
Put it between your eyes when I should die
Need six feet in a ditch like a bitch
Just avoid the clip with the gauge
Nigga must have had a snipper
They came up pop collar
Hollow point tips to the brain
Bug to the bang I'm stuck in this game
Can't get away cause I'm in too deep
Running the street with heats
Never nigga can hang
You might as well get up and bitch defeat
If a nigga don't know way, know it now
Grab your shit cause it's going down
Fuck one time
Cause I'm on the frontline
Popping slugs with my dogs as we going down
Still hold it ground boy
You know what it is
Hit him in the face with a death kiss
Don't know what his problem was
But all I can say is that a nigga had a death wish
Should have messed with the wrong clique
Saw the nigga drop when I felt the chrome click
That's what you give or talking shit
Now you lying in the hospital
What you don't seek
Here come one in the head
Left it brain dead
Got to put it more life support
Living day by day on the edge of the lens
But he didn't realize that life was short
Now Eazy turning your sleep put your heat
My stars as I match and I creep so cold
You are the wrong nigga to fuck with
So fuck with me best believe it
You gonna reap what you sow
Reap what you sow, sow, sow, sow

Deadly night
It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

Silent night

It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

Feel your body drubbing
As the weakest pumping jumping

I'm back with the mo thug family
Nigga they creeping they sipping
Motherfucker wanna get rowdy, hardy
Had to fuck top everybody
With my nigga BG in, just stock all me
Back with the gauge in the double glock party
Hardy round for your head
Nigga what you want? Now you are dead
Blood red, blood red this only sign
Should us select the gun right
This only sign, should us select the gun
You wanna fuck with me?
Sit ain't funny when you lie in the bed
Covered up in a coffin
Motherfucker, what's happening?
Wanna fuck up my nigga like septin?
Mo thug gonna put it down rapping
Motherfucker don't stop kill mo bug
I'm down for the world
For bloody
Everybody wanna see me
Be like me, hear me
But you cannot pull down trek like me
Nigga so I just spray and spray
The king all over your ear drum
Till you start to do bleed, eternally thugs
Mo thug much love, right

Behold, better move so scold
Then it is on to fly
Then it will all haul back to my family
Nigga give a shit today
Put the ding and blood out to book
Keep eternal life there
Choose to never repent and camp on fire
Bullet proof this way
Must you prepare for consequences hanging
Soldier don't go to this section, finna get high
My bullets and brimstones
Should leave me alone but no
Such to address Flesh Bone
Make yourself for the ram of death is on
Honey nothing can try
Not as my turn then go trap all enemies
All enemies under my combat look them
Kill them and collect my local ways
???East 1999??? nigga Saint Claire
Sieving for the body body, check to them
Never no close to tuition
Murder when I'm leaving no track
Not for a maniac, it's a shame
Niggaz that feeling the blind
Niggaz they still gone change
Hang the blind go strangle thugs
Go to wreck with the mix man
Ready for rise to rising indeed
Better wait for love of a Pharaoh nothing more
To the creature churn on
Don't pay money on to sacrifice him high
I say that healing you
None of us thought that go fucking with the 5th dog
Armageddon
Don like a thief
And I can catch you sleeping in the ceiling
Go rock on my court
Stupid motherfucker that heard, that heard
Pull it it's a souvenir, then you'll blow

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In ? in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this ? this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you want to leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You want to diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain

And make a change

Fletcher Harris,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

You've made me break a many true vow

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

And it's bound to drive your mama wild
It must be something they call the Cuban Doll,
It weren't your mama's angel child

I went to see the doctor the other day, he said I's well as well could be
But I said, ""Doctor, you don't know really what's worrying me""
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my loving all the time
I want to be somebody's baby doll to ease my mind

He can be ugly, he can be black, so long as he can eagle rock and ball the jack
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the time,
I mean to get my lovin' all the time

Here! Here! Hurray for Christmas

Christmas comes but once a year, and to me it brings good cheer,
And to everyone who likes wine and beer
Happy New Year is after that, happy I'll be, that is a fact
That is why I like to hear, folks I say that Christmas is here

Christmas bells will ring real soon, even in the afternoon
There'll be no chimes shall ring at the Christmas Ball
Everyone must watch their step, or they will loose their rep
Everybody full of fare at the Christmas Ball

Grab your partner one an' all, keep on dancing 'round the hall
Then there's no one to fall, don't you dare to strut
If your partner don't act fair, don't worry there's some more over there
Seekin' a chance everywhere at the Christmas Ball",At the Christmas Ball,1999

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Fleurie,"Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in (slept in)
Broken legs but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion

Yo, my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics, they're all over the place
There's songs in the mirrors written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't want to see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't want to be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't want to see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't want to see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact I think I'ma burn this room right now
So now this memory for some reason just won't come down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

Inside this mansion

Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
See, my problem is I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover em up, like it never happened
Say I wish I could change, are you confused?
Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, just keeps getting fuller it seems
The moment I walk in to it is the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
And one of the first things I wrote was I wish I would have called
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing like it’s out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
Inside this mansion

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside so stop watching
I'm not coming to the door so stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve ´em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking?
I don't know anymore

Vamos a aclarar solo una vez mas hoy estoy tomando, no lo hago porque me haces falta, ciego estaba yo esa es la verdad, todo porque los consejos que me daban no escuchaba.
Hoy estoy en el bar, yo soy el galán, tengo nuevo carro, nueva ropa, why traigo nueva niña.
Si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento desde te fuiste tu olor ya no siento.

why me siento bien no me quejare vine a celebrar que tu ya te haz marchado pero en realidad vamos a brindar por el gran papel de niña buena que habías jugado.
Why pensar que yo creí en tu amor hoy me he dado cuenta que yo estaba tan equivocado.
Brindo por mi donde quiera que estés, ya no encontrarás quien te haga mujer.

Flight of the Conchords,"Aww Yeah
Girl tonight we're gonna make love
You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday
And Wednesday night is the night that we usually make love
Monday night is my night to cook
Tuesday night we go and visit your mother
But Wednesday we make sweet little love

When everything is just right
There's nothing good on t.v.

So you are not too tired
Oh, boy, it's all love

You're trying to say ""Aww, yeah. It's business time.?

You're trying to say it's time for business,
It's business time, oh
It's business
It's business time
Aww ohowoah yeah, yeah

Then in the bathroom brushing our teeth
That's all part of the foreplay, I love foreplay
Then you go sort out the recycling
That isn't part of the foreplay,
But it's still very important

Next thing you know we're in the bedroom
You're wearin' that baggy old ugly T-shirt you got from work several years ago
Mmmm, you know the one, baby
With the color stain

I remove my clothes
Very very clumsly
Trippin' sensually over my jeans 'cause I'm still wearing my shoes
But it's OK because I turn it all into a sexy dance.

Next thing you know I'm wearing absolutely nothing
Except for my socks
And you know when I'm down to just my socks
What time it is
It's business time

[Chorus]
It's business
It's business time
When I'm down to my socks it's time for business
That's why they're called business socks, oh
It's business
It's business time
Oh, ho ho ho oh yeah, yeah

Making love
Making love for
Makin' love for two
Making love for two minutes
When it's with me you only need two minutes,
Because I'm so intense
Two minutes in heaven is better than one minute in heaven

You turn to me and say something sexy like, ""Is that it?""
I know what you?re trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, ""Aww yeah, that's it""
And then you tell me you want some more
Well, uh... I'm not surprised

I knew it when you said just then when you told me you were leaving

I'm not weeping because you won't be here to hold my hand
For your information there's an inflammation in my tear gland

I'm not upset because you left me this way
My eyes are just a little sweaty today

Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet

Just two silhouettes in the mist

And we'll drink for the lonely tonight

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch

Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out

Even with a suspended license, still finna flip

The fun we had, your love was super
But it made me glad, you were the only one
Who could set me free, if god gave me a wish
As you were to be, can't somebody explain me plainly
How to rid myself of the memory that causes pain
Again and again
Baby you was more than a friend
Without you it's hard to cope with the everyday strain
That comes bocu, you was like soul food, and real true
Any problem that came about you
I'll never forget that time we met

Haunts my reverie

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows

For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart

Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string

Flip Phillips Sextet,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places
Suspicious of all
Now who dat?
Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead

Never fuck with these herbs

Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match

Of bullets to blow up the map

-my life is based on the same place and the same zone
-thugs call me the Don, but never feel my calm
-at the same time you know it's hard for me to stay on 
yeah I'm feelin ya, but at I gotta keep it real with ya
only when you got dough, niggas want to be with ya
they feel ya out, find out about your whereabouts
best friends turn enemies, plotting to take you out
-but it's all good, becuz they show me love in tha hood
-I got this shit locked,don't worry bout it. lemme cross ya out

Chorus:
Hey yo, I walk by myself,I die by myself
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me but my goddamn self
I do for my self,make moves for my self
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me but my goddamn self
I walk by myself,I die by myself
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me but my goddamn self
I do for my self,make moves for my self
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me but my goddamn self

Verse 2:
You see them cats that you run with, they allways in some dumb shit
I'm tellin you right now, them cats shouldn't fuck with
-Now who the fuck is you? To tell me what to do?
-tryin to start some real shit, tryin to make me flip on my crew
Go ahead and play hardass! live your life fast
tryin to warn you, seem like these streets got you gassed
-I got a problem right now, and I can't maintain
-I got some big time cat tryin ta split my fame
-yo, you see me in the street and want to scream my name
-with some caked up voice, yo I made my chioce
-Tim and his boys foul plans was to leave me moised
-so I stood up,prayin to God that this ain't my last luck
-yo they got me judged, call tha blue cross cops ran up
*FREEZE!!!*
-say please don't move too much, I think my man sat me up
-on a fact(?) shining to much
Left you wet up,same muthafuckas used to friend up
got you hospitalized, look how you end up
hooked up to a respirator, body all bent up
your moms callin me at my home,cryin on the phone
why the fuck you didn't listen? wouldn't be in this position
you still breathing, a chance to change the way you living
-no more claiming the streets, I got a daughter to raise
-if i would've listened to you, I would never have got blaised
-now I'm fucked up,laying in this bed cramped up
-needles in my arm, thinkin how these cats play tough
-real thoughts in my head,oh how I showed 'em love
-fuck it, from now on gotta keep my shit real calm
-plans to move up outta there, and grab my family to be gone

The gritty groove, smash fifty-two 
And levitate your side

Splatter brains on dash ports
Start anthrax wars
See's cast like task force die on a cross (ha)
July 4th blow your hands off (Blaow!)
Special delivery
Jam 'cause with ghetto misery when I'm killabrese of canine
Last name heard it through the grapevine
Killing your blood millineum bug
United States divide with hate crimes
Roll snake eyes
In the concrete jungle of hell
While Lord Have stays Super like the son of Jor-el

What!
You know we got it locked way out of state
What!
Better Run for cover for it's too late
What!
You know we got it locked way out of state
What!

I be the last nigga 
The quick to bust your ass niggas
Do anything in this world to get the cash niggas
I might even get mad and even slash niggas
Rob them and get away in a car and crash niggas
What!'s the world gonna do when I drop the smash nigga
Iron all in your face don't make me pull the trigga
Another reason for me to have to poor my own swigga
Thought I was posing for word up but a fed took my picture
Surgeon general I represent the underneath
The ask for shit beef
The worlds greatest fucking thief 
Brick layer hardcore smash your front teeth
Wilding it straight giving their mother mad grief
Rob a nigga strip him down leave him in his briefs
Do so much dirt the priest asked me to turn another leaf
Made the priest flip change his whole belief
Started wildin' in the club with them niggas starting beef

Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open

Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.

Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.

Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.

Hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all

Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga, fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

Shot up my cops, Dirty Harry
You stickin' me is like niggas fuckin' the Virgin Mary
Shit we carry will have you found layin' down
Somewhere damp and muddy, split your tummy
Puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody

So now I leave your body to rot
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin' water, boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin' your pops?

You messin' wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the excursion, heads is turnin'
Flipmode we still mergin'
Now we splurgin' in suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans

Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin' words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck and four to even the score
Graveyard shifter mister, y'all believe in the law

Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballet shoes steppin', do the best that I can can
Like Pointer sisters, who could join the wizard?
Talkin' outta place, I pick the knife up and cut the tongue
Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Before all the plaques and the Source Aawards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride, so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin', rampage, I ain't trippin'
Check all the magazine clippin's

Yo, I pluck pigeons, get brains in expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy, like midnight, I'm pickin'
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, in these violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes

Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mash his ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin’ half ass shit, splash kids
Poke ‘em with the bassinet in the neck, graphic

Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin' in tongue with six blocks callin' my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin' your drums with hot shit and more to come

But then we manifest the truth
The niggas fight predictions from The Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin' all through your district

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Who's a monkey wrench, jumpin' machines get in between, so it seem
It'll only cause a moment of scream
The super seed what I be sayin' is like a king on his knees

Blast a pistol, that's when ya start to hear my missile whistle
Jesus, pledge of allegiance to the sole prestigious
With the antidote to make ya wanna bust ya heaters

Release this, I hope ya know that we about to freak this
Fuck discreteness, analyze every nigga weakness
Cut ya face up, then fuck the place up
Pass the L, without the coca lace up, let's pick the pace up

Blow the space up, while ya gaspin' off ransom

Gangsta bitch, deadly like cancerous
I bring it where your parents live, show you what your status is
Steam-boil your cabbages, I can't take y'all niggas fagotness
You about to die, show him where his casket is
You wanted beans, I had your hood under siege
Guns get squeezed, and bullets hit your knees

SO WHO ARE YOU?
Bus-A-Bus now, somethin' fo' sho'
Keep 'em whilin' till somebody's left a leak on the flo'
And how you doing?
We've been awaitin' the God, to make an under novel entry
Controllin' everything in the yard
Rugged like General Custard it seems
How we crush grapefruit, niggaz, and make a mustard out of your team
You know we hotter than the 4th of July
So sit back and watch the fireworks show light up my name the sky

I tell a cat to his face, his whole plan wack
Couple grand stacks, trizzin hand bags
Target practice, no tellin where they land at

Panic attacks like they found anthrax on Amtrak
Better stand back, my niggaz get yo man clapped
Rock-a-bye baby like you O.D.ed on Zantac
People love me, see us in the street hauk us
Send little kids to the motherfuckin beat walkers
Model type had to turn down three offers
Leather outlets, wood berry, Nancy Crawford's
Gangsta, hang with murderers and tree-sparkers
Type to sell ya body parts to the meat markets
See me, I'll validate your free parking
I'm the best emcee, and that ain't the weed talkin

On the side of me, was my security footies
The word in the clubs; Rampage is a bully
I never stay at one place dawg, I gotta boogie
I keep it cool but I'm addicted to six figures

Whip double Duquotis and pop a double clutch
And make bitchs skip to my lou and the double dutch
Pass a nigga the spliff, you watchin a nigga smoke it down
Drag a freak back to my crib and watch me poke it out
Soak it down, now you know when a nigga broke it down
I put the dick all inside her throat, now watch her choke it down
Scope around fiends we sling the dope around
Sling the soap around, little faggots see we don't joke around
Hardcore sound that we bangin just like a quadropound

Hah, hope you see we'll roast you bi-coastal

Gettin money from chef, at lunch I eat TOFU!

You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards

Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay

And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son

Flipper,"Turn away, turn away from the wall
Turn away, turn away from the wall
Face me now, Face me now
Show me, show me all your tears
Your pain, your pain makes me burn

It's my shame
It's my shame we both hurt
We both hurt

I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands
With my hands

And I saw you
I saw you shine
I was holding you

I saw your face. I saw our face as you heard my words
My words
And you left me. You left me to hold yourself

And I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands
With my hands

The lights have all gone out
The lights have all gone out
But I saw you
I saw you shine



",(I Saw You) Shine,1982
Flipper,"I too have sung death's praise
But I'm not going to sing that song anymore
Yes, I've figured out what living is all about
It's life! life!

Yes life! life!
Life is the only thing worth...
Life! life!
(I know it has it's ups and downs)
",Life,1982
Flipper,"Feel so numb feel so dead
Just felt like someone hit my head
Like someone knew just what to do
Poison the masses catch the running few
Feel so empty feel so old
Just waiting to feel the death like cold
Eating away at my life ties
Not really knowing not caring why

Life is pretty cheap. sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap. it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap. there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap.
Except for the cold delirious few

Dying too young living too fast
It's starting to feel like I'm living in the past
The pain is strong more than one can bear
Why is there religion. it's just not fair
People cling to things to make to make their lives seem real
Crawling like bugs at some fool leader's heels
Boasting of freedom when they're tied down with chains
It's time to give it up. here comes the death rain

Life is pretty cheap. sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap. it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap. there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap.
Life is pretty cheap.
Except for the cold delerious few
",Life Is Cheap,1982
Flipper,"We're living for life to be the way we feel
Not living for life, but the death appeal
Who wants a cancerous boring end
When you can die from misery and following the trend?
I say ""who cares anyway? who listens to what I say? ""
This song rhymes and we play it in time

And if you wanna live in super market isles
And take your vacation by flying for miles
Take a day off and live in the lies
While others work and capitalize
I say ""who cares anyway? who listens to what I say? ""
This song rhymes and we play it in time

We're living like cockroaches in this place
Sprayed with insecticide that leaves no trace
And if we could crawl on you at night
You could be sure we'd love to bite

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
And at night, it's a nightmare

It's time to enlist
The people speak as one
The cattle, the crowd
Those too afraid to live
Demand a sacrifice
A sacrifice

Cant you smell their stinking breath
Listen to them
Wheezing and gasping and
Chanting their slogans
The grave diggers song
Demand a sacrifice
A sacrifice

Can't you smeel the fresh blood
Steaming into the soil
As our patriots
Fathers and mothers and lovers
Admire the military style
Praising Gog and the state
Crying tears of pride
For the sons and lovers
For all the fools slaughteres
For the maimed, the dying
And the dead
So the nation will live
So the people will remain as cattle
Demand a sacrifice

Flipper,"I've seen many things 
In this world that I doubt 
Exist anywhere else 

Lives that enjoy 
Never having to be disturbed 
Exist some place else 

Love that is unbroken 
Resides in a lovers heart that 
Exists in someone else 

Passion burns so hot 
In the lust of desires need to 
Exist for someone else 

Pain is felt so hard 
In other lives who 
Exist without soul what else 

Try as they might 
Some do not want to try 
Exist forsaking something else 

The day will come 
When all those who have fought so hard 
Exist in peace where else 

I see the day 
When Ill just say that I 
Exist my love for you who else",Exist or Else,1993
Flipper,"And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go 

And I say 
Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

Now all the time we spent runnin around 
City to city, any club, any town 
We got a taste of the audience zeal 
What makes them hop and bop and feel 
They want to dance and have a good time 
We gotta keep the tempo upbeat all the time 
But we are trying to do something new 
Playing discord in theory and that chord too 
Abundant vibrations so pure and true 
Move about betraying me and you 

The nations taste changes from day to day 
First its humor becoming ultra violence decay 
Its just a game of the rat eats the dog 
Lead the pack or be forever lost 
So many kings to rule just one hill 
To me its crap, I say just be real 
I have to stand out from the rest 
Vocational noise puts myself to the test 

The music squeaks, squawks and drones on 
A magic feeling where nothing can go wrong 
I lift my head proud, the feeling is bliss 
My body starts a motion and I start to twist 
Scream and shout but never resist 
even though there's no control 
Until falling down makes its cycle whole

Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go",Flipper Twist,1993

Kinda relieved it every day

Your feelings show way deep down inside of 
you when you know your mind is twisted 
And untrue it seems so strange the range 
You claim to have to show when all your actions 
Take on a surrealistic threatening glow acting 
The way you do fuck that well you know what 
Does it show what does it prove you're in some 
Groove workin through the stages now toward 
Something new but what does it show and what 
Do you know well it pays to know it pays to know 

Now in the time you spent so well figure yourself 
Out to tell did you ever wonder why some 
Things turned out to be such lies did you look 
Deep way within and figure out where lies the sin 
Could there be a clue left out overlooked and 
Thrown about I want to know what can you show 
One thing for certain it pays to know it pays to 
Know which way you're going yes it pays to know 
It pays to know set your sail in the direction 
The winds blowin ohh it pays to know what can 
You show and what does it prove",It Pays to Know,1993

who give the truth 
become the slaves of the receivers

Once it starts you cannot see it 
Stripped of all but left with your senses 
All tangled up in a useless adventure

Once it starts you never see them 
Once it starts you cannot believe them 
you've torn my heart right from my chest 
Its time to give that subject to a rest

Flipper,"I´m all alone in my room
I´m sitting here near the shelf
I see the mirror on the wall
The things I do are not for my health
I live alone with my lies darker than any night
A fear so real I might die from fright
Until...someday

So I reach for my death, yes it´s the ultimate one
The needle shines sharp deep gleam into my skin
I feel the relief, I lose all the pain
And when I open my eyes it comes back right again
I start to scream deep from inside
But all that noise just won´t seem to hide the fact that
Someday someday

So here I sit the bliss lost once again
My mind conjures up images once known as sin
I gather strength to look outside
I see the lives of friends, they run and hide
And now they´re gone and what they did
So I pray to no God absolve me of no sin
I see your smile, it warms my soul
Reassuring me it´s not our time to go

Until...someday someday someday

And when i´m far away from you my dear
I miss so much the feelings we share
And I want to hold on to you so tight
Breathe my hot breath down your neck tonight
Hold on so long the feeling is real
Only one thing can replace that deal
I find the thing that makes my life surreal
A cheap replacement
Because sometimes it feels like love
(repeat 4x)

Someday someday someday
",Someday,1993
Flipper,"Now when I'm sick and tired and I'm far away from home
I need to hear your voice on the telephone
That's just what I need to feel at home
No matter how far away I am, how bad I feel
'cause there's no greater thrill in my life
Than to hear your sweet voice in my ear, it's nice
It makes the miles apart not so far
Brings hope to me like a shining star

I get so tired out when I reach over and dial out
And all I get is the stupid machine it says
""I'm not at home right now
If you know what I mean
So if you will leave your name and number
Sometime I'll give you a call back and if you don't
I won't make time for you no more, jack""

See I'm sick and tired of layin' alone
I get these cold sweats when I'm far away from home
And if I could just hear your voice one more time
I might have a little inspiration to continue
My life in a way that I can that doesn't seem
So destructive as I am but it's ok if I don't
Get you today, I'll just listen to your
Answering machine ok fucked up piece of
Shit 30 seconds and I'm cut off
No return calls (once a week)",Telephone,1993
Flipper,"[Chorus:] 
We are not crazy, were goin insane 
Its not our fault you decided to blame 
Yourself for walkin in the front door 
you're gonna come back tomorrow 
And pay a little bit more 

Its been such a long time 
Carrying on with the same old show 
Its been such a strange time 
The burdens on the people who just don't know 
Its happening much too fast 
every moments made to fade or last 
There is no time invloved in judgements 
As I just let go of a twisted little laugh 

[Chorus] 
Now I'm left wondering 
What will become of it all 
Is there a flaw in the grand scheme of things 
A little tear through which it all falls 
are there any heroes left 
In social service to human kind 
As the madness intertwines to happiness 
We all seem blind 

[Chorus] 
Now if tomorrow didn't come 
And yesterday had no past 
You would blow your mind right away 
Cause now is a concept very few can grasp 
To practice it requires no effort 
I don't think about it at all 
And if you can't handle it 
You can always get right back in line

The blood that I bleed it flows through your veins
Even in my lowest point I can still hear your words to my brain
First time I was arrested mommas love was tested
I couldn't contest it so here's my confession you're my blessing
You're the reason I believe you're the reason I sing
You're the reason angels tangle me in heavenly things

I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones

I feel the vibe inside me and I'm not gonna let it go 
So come on 
And I'm laughin' and cryin' and buyin' time 
I'm not gone let it go 
So come on 
And I'm findin' a dime thata wanta good time and I'm not gonna let her go 
So come on 
And it's all on the line but I'm still gone' shine I'm not gone let it go 
Hey 
Slow it down for a minute while I capture the sky 
Surfing the clouds wind surfin' through a deep sea dive 
The devil's tryin' to get up in my soul but I'm not gone let it go 
So come on 
And I'm drinkin' this spiritual wine so he can't fuck with my flow

He got a need for speed 
But what you runnin' from playa 
I think he runnin' from me 
Take ya time and just relax 
He ain't got time to take 
Slow it down and think about it 
He got moves to make 
Strugglin' and scrapin' takin' chances attemptin' to make it 
The time that was taken was tedious but fuck it we made it 
Created much later now playin' n' singin' invaded with Piper n' Dave 
And the angels bout to make us the greatest 
Somebody save us the shit that we spittin' soundin' ridiculous 
Rippin' and gifted with lyrics flavored up more than licorice 
Shift it and kick it with enough spittage to make it Sickenin' 
Skippin' stones, mama I'm gone its time to rip this shit

Some girls I'll never trust

Flipsyde,"Happy Birthday. So make a wish.

Please accept my apologies, I wonder what would have been.
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes.
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex,
Choosing our life over your life meant your death.
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes,
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life.
Would you have been a little genius? In love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa The Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose,
And the way you would've laughed and talked fast or slow.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

I got a million excuses, as to why you died.
And other people got their own reasons for homicide.
Who's to say it would've worked and who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad.
The fear of being my father has never disappeared,
I ponder it frequently while I'm sippin' on my beer.
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create, I made a mistake.
But now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you.
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we were confused.
Maybe, every time that he smiles it's you proudly knowing
That your father's doing the right thing now.
I'll never tell a woman what to do with her body,
But if she don't love children, then we can't party.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

And from the Heavens to the womb to the Heavens again.
From the ending to the ending, never got to begin.
Maybe one day we can meet face to face,
In a place without time and space. Happy birthday.

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take

Falling faster no one here

A speeding slab of concrete hits me in the eye
Broken bones that I won't get the chance to feel

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve 
Trapped in a belly of hell

Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your solid
Don't understand the point that you at

Or how the hell you came to it?

They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Accuse a Hurricane
Ain't change a damned shame
It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane

Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?

Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever and ever yo, locked down forever
Could you stand the weather?
Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible,
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

Yo, yo, a Hurricane forever,
Imagine your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?

I can't even explain the pain
Imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever and ever, ever
Could you hold it together?

Yo, can't explain the pain with words, know'm saying?
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

[Chorus]

Your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying?

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind",Hurricane,2000

I let you
We broke the ties that bind

Still, the magic of the night I met you

Es gibt keine Sekunde in der ich nicht mit dir down bin
Ich weiß, ich bin ein einzigartiger Dickschädel
Doch ich will, dass du weißt, dass ich alle Tage für dich lebe
Und alles was du tust, alles was du bist
Ist so wie der Blues, den ich für dich sing
Ein Traum der wahr wird, ein Haufen Farbe
Wie ein Gedicht für mich

Du bist, du bist
Wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich

Du bringst Farbe in mein Leben wie ein Regenbogen
Fühl mich wie ein Engel ohne Flügel auf dem Weg nach oben
Schweb auf Wolke 8, immer wenn ich dich auf der Straße sehe
Du bist wie das Meer und ich würde gern in dir baden gehen
Dein Körper ist ein Wunderland, ich geh auf Entdeckungsreise
Wenn ich wie ein aufgeweckter Schmetterling dein Bett umkreise
Du bist ein Gedicht, im Grunde die perfekte Frau
Draußen auf der Straße eine Lady und im Bett ne, (wow!)

Du bist, du bist
Hmm, wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich

Du bist, du bist
Wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich (ey!)

Es gibt tausend gute Gründe dir ein Lied zu singen
Doch keines meiner Worte kann beschreiben wie verliebt ich bin
Ich hätte Lust dich über die Schwelle ins Bett zu tragen
Und alle Probleme wären auf der Stelle wie weggeblasen
Vögel fangen an zu singen, Wolken ziehen in Herzenform
Über meinen Kopf hinweg, es kommt mir wie ein Märchen vor
Was soll ich sagen, wie soll ich's dir nur beschreiben?
Jetzt wenn Worte deinen Kopf verlassen klingt es wie ein Streichquartett

Wir zwei sind wie die „Schöne und das Biest“
Irgendwo gestrandet im Paradies
Das mit uns ist wie ein Trip nach Paris
Ein frei-Flug ins All, flüster ich dir leise ins Ohr
Wir zwei sind wie Julia und Romeo
Und endlich fallen die Steine wie beim Domino
Wir machen 20 Kinder mindestens, sowieso
Komm, wir ham noch einiges vor

Du bist, du bist
Hmm, wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich

Now my string of wemen hotter than Campbells soup
Boy that cake will make them peps turn to animals

Denzel with the ice and I'm pushin' weight
I ain't tryin' [?] 'em all

I ain't tryin' ???
But Biggie got a wife she ain't with him not a day
Ain't no body here to stay
You can try and get away

All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

The hood never caused but they all was hard
His kind never represented love at all
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top
Access granted with this empty can of starch
No not the Bentley liquor store got robbed
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large
I wrote XXL in the view of my squad
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow

Everybody in the projects family home

But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun
Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1
Without the struggle probably never would'a heard of Lebron
Try and juggle in the casket wit ya sister Lavonne
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue
Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song
Yeah it could of been tragic for the boy from the scums
Yeah he got the craft-matic no rest till I won
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone
Born near the savages kinda made me numb
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum

Of all the nights I had to grind
Taking chances with the system,
I put my whole life on the line
All my life know it ain't been sweet
All my life I been in the streets
All my life up against concrete
All my life mama gave me the speech
All my life somebody died every week
All my life ducking the police
All my life without soda I weeped
All my life no first class seats

Shorty whats up! She had

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Hey parking lot pimpin', yeah that's the way I approached her
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster
Miss, got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder
Serious, she the business and I need closure
So hood and I'm startin', I'm blowin' see no stuck up trumpin'
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin' my platinum my money
This ain't your normal every day baby
The type to drive nothin' less than that 600 Mercedes
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380
I feel like she put me under a spell
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal
I put her on my tab, had her sippin', call a cab

I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go
Look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut 3 times in the room
Times in a room
Cause I spent 20 on my tires
30 to be icy
But me bein' fly that's priceless
And I gave 40 to my side chick
50 to the wifey
But me bein' fly that's priceless
Baby that's priceless

Err but the projects
Postin' that's the object
Me talkin' cash
Then you better switch the topic
Bitch nigga stop it
Gon' ahead and cop it
Money in the bag
Probably takin' out the garbage
I know them boys snitchin'
Cause they're scared of 1st degree
But you can tell em f.e.d's
I'm in VIP
With 4 mill chedda' keep boy keys
The window to the wall
Supplier of what you need

Got no wife but the wife be my girlfriend
My girlfriend girlfriend
Lookin' for a girl friend
Nick name tail spin
Meet you in da whirlwind
Lord hear the way
Now they ask you where the world went

[Chorus]

I'm so fly
Not to mention that I'm priceless
Ya ain't never seen
Heard of them
None like this
Thousand dollar jeans
Air force 2 Nike's
Prowlin' in the club
Give a fuck about indictments
You can bartender but the drinks on me
2 magnums in my hand
One fo' creeps one fo' freaks
Too much legal tender
So its raining bubbly
My ice the same color
How Kelis used to be

Hold up wait a minute
Pop pop niggas ain't even they spinnin'
I made a make dollars
So it have to make sense
I'm born out liquor
I'ma dead president
All long day
All long die
Toe tag money see it fallin' out the sky
Bitch if I'm priceless
Then bury me alive
My pockets like caskets
Death live inside

[Chorus]

Alligator wit the sways
50 on the carpet
All yellow hard 8s
Scarface white leather
Purple cush
Green all red shinin' any weather
Customized jeeps for high priced life nigga
Get it till you cant no mo
Shop till you cant no mo
10 on some new shoes
50 on the boy
100 on some new jeans
And give a fuck bout the price
Precious little tight blue heart on my mike
She'll get your whole life for a stack
Get yourself something nice

My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's greener on the other side.

I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my hoe got missin'.
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position.
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin'.
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then witness.
Well I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions.
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen.
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission.
I'm sheddin' tears messin up my vision, this hoe gon' make me go to prison.

[Chorus]

That hoe cost me my job, I'm afraid I should of learned mo' about the business.
A hoe is good for diggin', I should of know this from the beginnin'.
I don' got caught slippin' now I'm tripping out the door somebody else found interest.
Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different. Better to know then have intuitions.
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this bitch came from a bar?
Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage. I was a gentlemen right from the start.
Ever since I put the hoe in my touch, now this bitch won't even spare me the rod.

[Chorus]

7 years now it's all over, now hold on goin' gotta feel me brah.
Left my home, no sign of luck. I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone.
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks.
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.
If I would of known my hoe was just temporary.
And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.
I feel like going to war like the military.
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.

Forgetting everything we had

I keep running back

Forgetting you treat me so bad

Gets no lower than a grabbin' on your feet
A man will stand for nothin' if he fall off with the feet
A baller and a hitter all in the street

Who the hell gon' do it free, if I don't get up and bust my ass
That's my motto, I can't put my faith in the lotto
Luck don't stay nowhere near where I go

Unless you ride that muthafucka
And you be lucky enough to get away in the grave
What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid
But I got grazed, the bullet went through but I ain't get paid

Walked 'em in my door, but please wipe your feet on the rug
You can keep your shoes on, it's all love

Boy let me stop, I'm dreamin' too much, now who the hell
Won't give the model a million bucks?

To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable

If I could I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind

I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to
But these tears got me searching for an inner tube
Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose
Don't wanna drown in my hurt 'cause it's critical
I pop champagne but still it's a damn pain

Beedee I love you my sister died but it never changed
My last love that we just ditched in my brain
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain
Lord knows I wish death never had a name

Our last breath that it never had a relevate

I lose myself when I think about my people's slain

Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some
Big will I know heaven got the futon

Face good with the man paid your dues done
Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk
We had plans, plans change the new sun
The Lord never leave us lonely when you lose one

If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said

I were IP use it like it's pixel flap
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times
Everyday be forever when I'm puttin' down
Showing off that's the truth nah

Take the Breena and stuck 'em up all with answers

Growing up like the women from the exorcist
Her heart stopped in the ambulance

I kiss her in the mouth, she watch my money stack, 
She know I'm here forever, its deeper then a rap, 
I have multiple showing, she one in a milli,
Now its colorful stones, cause there's ice in my phillies,

[Juelz Santana]
Sorry, I gotta go I gotta get it, 
But she know how daddy roll I'm coming back home wit it, 
Sometime I take her wit me when I go and get my dough, 
Cause my girl roll harder then some niggas I know, 
And I know, that she know, I'm by her side, 
She by my side, 
And if I ride then she goin' ride and we goin' ride until we die, now now now now, 
Picture us rolling, in something stolen, steering wheel twirlin', 
Who? me and my girlfriend.

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
I gotta chick that'll hold me down, she moving no, when im outta town, 
She ride or die and keep it line she never deny me down, 
She find me shit that's bigger then ? the baddest bitch around, 
That's why I let her push the whip and drop the top and down, 
And give her the stacks you just imagine you should see the smiles,
I have her shipping crates to different places out of town, 
Baby we balling see them hatas they so out of bounds, 
Lets have a toast, I'm supposed to lay your body down, 
I spread the money round give it to ya doggy style, 
See this the remix bay I might just put that tonguing down, 
Gotta keep it gutta baby I'm trying to hear that moaning sound, 
Cause you my ride or die it ain't no question about that

Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour

Clean next get a call just a lil' visit

Cause I done hustled, no not dope just soap in vanilla envelopes
Check out my demo, oh I'm flo right now, when I go right now
Was it ever that simple, used to roll, get pumped like a Pitbull,
Out the way said I ain't got potential, cake walk guess I ain't get the memo
Ooh take a walk in my shoes, 'cause tonight my dreams they came true
And I'ma party it up through the roof (This is what we're waiting for)

In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

I've waited for this life
Waited for this time,
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup, one night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

Party people
I've got the wind at my head, my mind says yes when my body says when I equal,
No it's not an option, I'ma yes I can 'til this spaceship land with the Beatles
See the road blocks up and my autograph sucks but the leech is unbelievable
Got the round, but the bucks not wanna get bucked
But, my fist up, rock star sign
Guitars just broke, in my mind
Was packing up, I might get by
Talking bout luck, on my side oh
Take a walk in my shoes
'Cause in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof ooh (This is what we're waiting for)

And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

Even nicer when it makes you feel good

Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

It’s like Woodstock city, brand new billion
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrick
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on let’s go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain’t ready 'cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

Feeling wild shopper when you’re bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of its own
Love while I’m supposed to look around and it’s gone
Love while I’m supposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, I’m already gone,
Let the good times go

All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got, got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like I'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll

And let’s go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let’s go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast to the good times
May they last forever, we’re young, yeah the good times
Raise your glass, let’s all have some fun

I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But I wonder do you think of me
Do you think of me 'cause I'm thinking of

All I wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah)
And all I wanted is to be there by your side (yeah yeah)

I know that I gotta keep on telling lies
Should have swallowed my pride
But I think sometimes that

'Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope
A piece of mind better than Mission Impossible, who want impossible?
I take a bird in the hand if it's Toucan, but two can't play the start, get a new band
Rockin' wit you, get it poppin' wit you, wanna gossip wit you,
I don't wanna say I shoulda, coulda, woulda would
If you in this right mind, wanna keep a grudge
Let it flaunt, 'kay you never seen a dove dance to know the trouble water
Popper's daughter, Rolling Stones, she can't hide in her Louis clutch
The bigger man will not ? pretty much,
Another chance let it pass just like a book

I'm gonna try to keep my s*** together, oh yeah I know it's hard, what the hell I tell her
Hello, good morning, I was out for my homie Flo's birthday
But that excuse shouldn't have me coming home late
You straight, I'm straight, I don't wanna deal with the issues, ? couple times I'ma live with it
No, yo, you let know, I might come visit, that's when you know you got the rope around your neck
You're scratching, choking, whatever

That every day is sunshine
Can't go wrong, can't go wrong
Can't go wrong, can't go wrong
When every day is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine

I was born by the river with the sunblock
Say I'm cooking up the heat so I'mma stay hot
And just like that river, I've been running ever since
I know I can't go wrong if I'm on top
I've got the shine on me, when I say me he's gotta ride for the team
Cause I'm on that
The sun hit me every morning, the club with them models
Come and feel 'em like I'm calling
The Don Perrier, probably like a cactus
Throwing every Franklin, I'm a Tim Jackson
Action the napkins, wet, no cash, got a milly after taxes
I'm on the road to winning, I've been exposed to women
Already know what they getting but with the flow in the middle
They gotta think twice
And just know that every day is like sunshine
I know, I know

No intermission in the mission
All of my idols big pimping, all of my rivals been missing
This right here ain't revival, this right here is the birth of an idol
This right here is why I work for the title, I gotta be an icon
My old man had dreams of putting nice, he rest in peace
A lil bit of him rest in me
Every time that I'm blessed to be
I work hard, got scars, I got a mother I provide for
I got homies I would die for
A big sis I would lie for but I ain't relying on this record
No, I'm working on my vernacular
I'm tryina have a lil' brains to back it up
I used to roll around town in a maxima
Now my next step looking spectacular
And that right there is a blessing
Truest evil when this shit go wrong, don't stress it
'Cause sometime the universe testing you

Hundred dollars on my flight, hundred G's every night

I started flat broke, now I'm poppin' rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club poppin', Ima burn a hundred grams
Check the parking lot pimpin', whip cost a hundred grand

I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game for all you thousand airs
It's funny sour D's will smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street

I'm sittin' twelve feet, fuck, can you tell me
I let the 12's beat, 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
So don't fall asleep 'cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak, they know I'm spittin' cheese

Got the models balkin', did it all with one watch

People love the product, so my people come to shop

My uncle, 65, he still sellin' dope
He claim he petrified, the field goin' broke
It's them Caddy Seville's, went from acid to pills
To elaborate deals if you want status you kill

'Cause they have it for real when I step in the spot
Treat the club like the charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes

Ballin' like I violated, bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, parachute to prevail
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell 'em take it easy

Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantasy
Left her panties at home standin' there thick as can be
Are I see K are O S S, standin' there dressed fresh

And I thought of what could go wrong

I'm already gone
Don't say a word
I can't hear you
Don't hold me close
I can't feel you

So I stopped at the store to grab cigarettes
Couldn't say it out loud couldn't fathom it yet
You finally feel and we feel like this

I'm sorry just wasn't enough destroying your faith
Preserving your trust we couldn't choose
And neither could I

I know that I left you for dead
Don't give up so soon
Because you know that we all have a bed
It's waiting for you in the recovery room

Just forget everything that I said
Washed out the wounds
Walls painted red
Waiting for you in the recovery room

She stood there in her summer dress
Wind caught her hair and failed to confess
I smiled as we raced through the night
My hand caught her wings then nothing felt right

You and I know your love comes once in a lifetime
Love comes once in a lifetime

She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look, but don't touch, they all wanna know us
If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down, don't play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway

So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, 'cause I know that your love comes
Once in a lifetime

Love comes once every now

And she was prom queen, I'm just a new Jack
My city tatted on my back, she had my back, I knew that
But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Them girls trouble
Come more than a lifetime and time don't wait for no one
I'm out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y
I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup and move her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and make-up
Don't ever make up, you better wake up

I'll never compare you to no one

Flobots,"[Spoken]
What I've realized since is that it's a very painful process but it is not destructive. It's the road to liberation. The what really happened in the sixties was that this country took just the first step toward admitting that it had been wrong on race, and creativity burst out in all directions.

From the color of the faces in Sunday songs
To the hatred they raised all the youngsters on
Once upon a time in this country, long ago
She knew there was something wrong
Because the song said ""yellow, red, black, and white
Every one precious in the path of Christ""
But what about the daughter
Of the woman cleaning their house?
Wasn't she a child they were singin' about?

And if Jesus loves us, black and white skin
Why didn't her white mother invite them in?
When did it become a room for no blacks to step in?
How did she already know not to ask the question?
Left lasting impressions
At a lesson, comfort's gone
She never thought things would ever change
But she always knew there was something wrong

Always knew there was somethin' wrong.
She always knew there was somethin' wrong

Years later, she found herself
Mississippi bound to help
Stop the legalized lynching of Mr. Willy McGee
But they couldn't stop it
So they thought that they'd talk to the governor about what'd happened
And say, ""We're tired of being used as an excuse to kill black men""
But the cops wouldn't let 'em past
And these women, they struck 'em as uppity
So they hauled 'em all off to jail
And they called in protective custody

Then from her cell
She heard her jailers
Grumblin' about ""outsiders""
When she called 'em out
And said she was from the south, they shouted,
""Why is a nice, Southern lady makin' trouble
For the governor?""
She said, ""I guess I'm not your type of lady
And I guess I'm not your type of Southerner
But before you call me traitor,
Well it's plain as just to say
I was a child in Mississippi
But I'm ashamed of it today""

She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
([spoken] And, all of a sudden, I realized I was on the other side)

Imagine the world that you're standing within
All of your neighbors, they're family-friends
How would you cope facing the fact
The flesh on their hands was tainted with sin?
She faced this every day
People she saw on a regular basis
People she loved, in several cases
People she knew were incredibly racist

It was painful, but she never stopped loving them
Never stopped callin' their names
And she never stopped being a Southern woman
And she never stopped fighting for change
And she saw that her struggle was
in the tradition of ancestors never aware of her 
It continues today:
The soul of a Southerner
born of the other America

She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong

What you win in the immediate battles is little compared to the effort you put into it but if you see that as a part of this total movement to build a new world, you know what could be (?????

Tight like a kryptonite with a bike pole
Sparks from my lips ignite liquid nitro
No telling if it might blow

The environments' gotta be hotter
Than solder beside the iron
Zinc vitamins
Hide'em inside when I'm writing the rhymes
It's hard to keep property guarded
Because of these pirates

And I motivate

You're fake and there's no escape

Frozen waitin' for the crosswalk

I can take it to another level
Where the bass is above the treble
And your face is in double
Evasiveness doesn't settle it

Where theres nothing to meddle with

Want sass kiss my moms ass

Born in the flood
Bloody fingerprint sets
Black marketed fresh
Water canons forget me not
Epitaph airbrush with death
White t's
Wife beaters
Button up
Reattach flesh

In between the lines
Outside of the law
Underneath the veil
We dig our foundations
We navigate the globe
Trying to find a pattern to break the mold
With a family to feed
There's nowhere we wont go
But what if were caught
They say I'm a snitch
Shot at the check point
Found with his throat slit
There's spray paint on the teleprompter
Anchorman screams that hes seen a monster
Mayday
There's bloodstains on his shirt
Mayday
They say that hes gone berserk

Sometimes
When I wanna shut out this world
Wanna rip up this page
Wanna pour out this heart
Wanna get up on this stage
And my lips become percussion
And my fists become the rage
And I pound on this table
Till it gives me something to say
Then I think about things that I've seen
Right in front of me
That I don't wanna believe
Gimme one of these mikes
Lemme let em know
The way that it is is not how its gonna be
Not if we don't let em get ahead of us
The present tensions no threat
Its just a fence across the path
That were already ready to walk
Rock solid footsteps
Let 'em put up obstacles
And prove that it isn't possible
Fuck that
We don't give em any weight
True liberty and freedoms at stake
Peace will never become pass
Live my life until my last day

It was half-past eight in the bat cave
When the cracks in the plaster collapsed
And gave way to gaps in the pavement
Mayday mayday
Put it on blast
For the passengers and messengers
'Cause this is a disaster
Where the fuck are the rescue workers
Not far
Off pissing on a cop car
In the hall with a pop tart
Sipping liquor in the rock bar
Everyone climb to the front line
Lunchtimes canceled
All hands on deck to pull survivors from the landfill
Onlookers passers-by shake off that rubble
Brush off your shoulders
Break free from your standstill

Signs of a better world
Causes we understand
Failures we expected to occur
And bring redemption for our sins
Safety from the crowds
In the shadows on the run
We write our own cider house
Rules to keep alive
Rituals that prove their worth
Search for systems we can trust
Rhythms we can lock into

This is madness salvage teams
Can't bandage
Hope when its damaged
Or broken compassion
Not enough rope in the van when
World is collapsing
Our mode of action
Broadcast through the glass
Its all we can manage
Donate with the plastic
Scraps from the salad
Hoping to balance
Emotions invalidated
And staged on 4:3 aspects
Just ballast for sadness
Lives shattered are standard
Fare for cameras and channels
Stare no abracadabras

No faster answers
Or mantras for disasters
Remastered and plastered
Got it all backwards
Do you know the faction your backing
Its another man down
Another mother gone
Child drowned
Another silenced song
Solitude
Another kind of strong
I miss you
Another strung along
Missing in action
Another page is blackened burned
Turned to ashes to ashes
Dust off the flags and the caskets
We will never find another you
Despite the life of love we knew
These lightning times are trouble who
Cant count the strikes that punished through
The bonds we thought would never break
And never will and never fade and never change
But there is the rage
Of losing you to their mistakes

In between the lines
Signs of a the next movement
Refuge from the crowd
Outside of the law
Causes we understand
Hands that trace
Instructions for descendants in the
Shadows on the run
Underneath the veil
Failures we expected to
Occur and bring redemption for our sins

Don't know how to be but angry
Feel infected like we've got gangrene
Please don't let anybody try to change me

Me
Just me
In the middle of a sea full of faces
Full of faces
Some laugh some salivate
Whats in your alleyway
Recycling bins or bullet cases

Its not equal
Its not fair
Were different people
But were not scared
We ain't never scared
To pave a new path
Make a new street
Build a new bridge

Say can you see by the dawns early light
Free slaves running
Songs words weren't right
Now a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise together
We rise together

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream universities
Or you and I verse the tees
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please let the hurting cease
Don't let apathy police the populace
We will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answers obvious
We switch the consonants
Change the sword to words and lift continents

Rise together
We rise together

If you've got more to give than you've got to prove

Flashback to when we didn't fund the dam
Didn't fund the damn levee
No wonder man
Now our whole damn cities torn us under man
Underwater but we still don't understand
We see hurricane spills overrun the land
Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand
No we still don't understand
We've seen planes in the windows of buildings
Crumbled in
We've seen flames sending chills through London
And we've sent planes to kill them
And some of them are children
But still we crumble under buildin'
Underfunded but we still don't understand
Under God but we kill like the son of Sam

Criticize they but who the f**k are we

But the leaders want war
Neighbors don't speak peak through the front door
House representatives preach stay the course

Hope that the pen strokes higher than the cannon
Balls to the wall nose to the grindstone

Places your bets lets peak to the enemy
Don't let them pretend that we seek blood

Umm,
Hold on 1 minute
Fun

Hello, Hi yeah it's me.
Yeah look I'm going 2 b home again late OK, alright yeah bye-bye.

[Chorus]
This isn't my idea of fun
Say I'm not going to be the one
This isn't my idea of fun at all at all at all at all at all

Love is meant to be so beautiful
Unconditional has it downs as well as highs
So wonderful
Am I supposed to be amazed
Or is this compulsory
I know love to well
My mind drifts alone
You never comes with me.
This isn't my idea of fun
Oh No

[Chorus]

I try to do this us, we
But this must be yeah a funny kinda of happy
Because lately I find me lacking in stories and yearning
Of wanting to be home and in your presence again
I find myself staying or just out delaying.
I'm tired of this lying all this false smiling
We're just prolonging and faith avoiding
I'm not the one y'all.
This ain't fun no.

[Chorus]

I had a complex for compliments for offering, for nice comments
For interest
Yeah for attention
In fact paranoia became an indiction
I tried to show affection in so many ways.
I'm gazing into eyes and with overnight stays
I'm cooking nice meals
Phone calls in the days
This ain't my way
This ain't fun.
Where's the fun gone?

Love is meant to be so beautiful
Unconditional has it downs as well as highs
So Wonderful
Am I supposed to be amazed
Or is this compulsory
I know love to well
My mind drifts alone
And when I go away.
You never comes with me.
This isn't my idea of fun
Oh No

I'm not this one
I'm not going to be the one.

It's not mine",Fun,2002
Floetry,"Baby
Ooo baby
Baby,baby
Ooo um baby
Oh baby

We need to um talk about where 
We're taking this thing
How far we're gonna let this go
We've been here before
Its getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me 
Watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice 
Baby, oh baby baby baby

Listen, I've already been thinking about you on my mind 
Far too often for you, 
To be here at this time 
You see, one hands on nine and the other's on my thigh
Look,I already played with the idea of you 
Being here in the morning 
And the position for the crack of dawn 
And the conversation before the yawning 
But aah, it's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh Baby baby baby

How's about I let you touch the space
That you left behind,
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling 
But now were talking, touching
Almost making sensual again 
We can taste the familiar,
'Cause, the family hour supports it
Of this moment,but was led by the movements cause ah 
It's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice 
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby twice baby baby

I see the memories we replayed
Same space face bodies
I know there's a method to your manliness
But ah I'm a afraid

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, you say don't be
But I'm afraid, and you say don't be
I'm afraid that you'll gonna hurt me baby, baby twice baby

I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, babe
I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, baby",Getting Late,2002
Floetry,"I, I'm feelin' low on energy
Listen, I feel weak, see

I get a headache
I get a headache

Listen, at first you said I do but now it's I did
Said together we should live
Now you're mad with time we spend
Used to be jealous of my friends an' fill my weekends
But now you're off for pastimes

Playin' games with my mind
You're layin' the blame in my lap
But delayin' layin' in our bed
Yo, I meant what I said when you weren't listenin'
An' I'm not sayin' it again

I get a headache
I get a headache

Yo, said, I'm not sayin' it again
You need to know that
See, I'm comin' to the end of my silent partnerin'
Or bargainin' for affection
I gain satisfaction from regulation, bare minimum

Your mind is made on obeyin' opinions
From acquaintances who's situation suggest loneliness
I try to leave but you protest
Professin' you love me

But can't show me lovin'
You want out but you keep me in
Patience runs thin as you go through your motions
I cry oceans, tears become orphans

As my soul leaves its apartment
I get migraines, heart strains
Tear stains an' fear gains
With increases in the pain, yo, I get a headache

I get a headache
Said, I get a headache
Baby, I get a headache
Said, I get a headache

I need to lie down
I need to lie down
I need my lipstick
Listen, I need, yo, it's, it's too loud
It's, it's too loud

Play it soft, turn the music down
Yo, could someone turn the music down?
It's too loud, it's hurtin' my head, please
Please, yo, please, turn the music down

Play it soft, turn the music down
Yo, I've got a headache
Just turn the music down",Headache,2002
Floetry,"This is memory lane, hello
November eleven 1998 (hello) and I met this guy
Man what's up I'm cool (oh)
This spirit this soul (oh)
He had this voice and his complexion and God those eyebrows 
I felt them before I ever touched him 
It was so
You're beautiful you got me singin' shades of amazin' rain
Plain and simply
You got me lovin' everything about you (thinkin' 'bout you)
First sight and I'm dazed I'm going crazy constantly thinkin'
If I should take a chance, should I take a chance and call you

Just to say hello, how are you, what you up to
Nothin' I'm cool she's fine, alright, that's true,
Who me, not u, 
She said, what you do
You crazy, for real though, 
Can I...let you know
Hello, How are u, what you up to, 
Nothin', I'm cool, she's fine, alright, that's true,
Who me, not u, 
She said, what you do
You crazy, for real though, 
Can I...let you know

I'm mesmerized, you got me doin' things I wouldn't usually do
To get next to somebody I was into 
And I'm into you babe into you babe
Last night we met I feel I've known you forever
And I would like to know that we can get it together
So I will call you yeah

Just to say hello, how are u, what you up to, 
Nothin', I'm cool, she's fine, alright, that's true,

Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know

You know your existence 
Has kinda been recognized 
By the resistance to dream
Eventually becoming a way of life to me
Enough to keep contentment 
Through waking hours to courting shades
In those early days
Math was exchanged 
I kinda had to build up the courage to just say
Hey, hello, remember me (hello) 
I just felt, just to say
How are u..how are you babe hello
how are you babe how are you babe hello
How are you babe how are you babe hello
How are you babe how are you babe hello

Floetry,"Remember how you used to ummm, you used to phone up and (ohh) 
You wouldn't say your name you, you'd just say Hey You

You know I see you on my blank sheet before I write or form oracle this situation yo, 
My memories choke me and stain my
Pillow as my voice becomes hollow as I trace tear lines around this space 
That won't fill yo I feel nothing but this way and
The emptiness stays and its cluttered with a silence that teases me 
It leads me on like it's gonna say, like it's gonna say

[Chorus] 
Hey You, I'm Sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back ohh, 
Hey You I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back one day

You know yesterday I stood outside in the rain in an attempt to dissolve away 
Or just disappear or be gone be back or be
Just I try to see the point but I only see the pain 
My dreams cry when they're slain I regain consciousness to blurry vision
I try to listen out for whispers of

Hey You, I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back oohhh,
Hey You I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back one day

Rain Drops disguise my tears have gone
I want you to be here with me to stand by me
Said I can't help but to be selfish baby cause I don't want to be alone

[Chorus]

Did I leave you behind or did you let me go
All I know is you're not here to say to me those special words (Hey You) 
Time was once on our side but now it's against us It parts us and we're not always (saints?)

[Chorus]",Hey You,2002
Floetry,"Sometimes blindness finds me
And leads me through ignorance
Not allowing us to gain experience
So we become lifeless
At other times I cover with 
Self pity or work aimlessly 
Through reality so
Occasionally I choose to travel alone
But never fulfill my possibility so
Mostly I attempt to achieve balance
By seeking right knowledge and loving 
And reviewing and eventually overstanding those
Many lessons of my life

You got me caught in 
A stormy odd world that drains
And I beg to see truth and promises 
You made to me
Now we've come so far 
But my visions of happiness 
With you in my life 
I'm afraid and confused
If I was a bird I'd fly

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now why do I feel so alone
Knowing I know I have you
And what made you turn around on me
What did I do
and when did love feel this way
So much pain and misery
Where's the you I once knew
And could ya fly with me

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now I can't stay
You won't need me
Set me free and let me fly 
Oh fly with me
Fly with me me
Fly with me yeah
Fly oh fly fly

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Fly away

Floetry,"It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Said I'm concerned that I feel this pain 
My heart is aching, breaking, pain staking in this gambling thing 
This ain't no parallel universe, parallel life 
You choose to in one your living like love of my life 
And in the other your the daddy of theirs 
So I play Russian Roulette and put this phone to my ear 
Just to say, yo this is Ms. Stress

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

See too much asked of me through his lips 
So I attempted to be all that dreams suggest to the ego and promise the soul 
I tried to be all he had ever told of the interchangeable face 
And physicality and mentality of she as closely ? 
He summoned all my tears abandoned we 
I lived alone for years, no longer knowing who exactly is me 
As I began the punishment for his perfection 
My vision nearly lost the direction 
My return to innocence was lost and his ID 
You see I forgot instead I saw protection through judgment 
Now angels and devils look alike to me 
Sometimes quiet sounds like lonely to me

My angel I stopped breathing for you 
If my life was possible without end to be sure 
If love I'm needing more than just a casual affair  
But the pain runs deep internally 
But clearly seen when your not there

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Yo, yo, yo it ain't my time to die right now

I don't get down like that 
But we were together for a while 
And you know things
Didn't work out but I can't be mad 
With him you know 
'cause we had some moments 
Yo I'll explain listen

We wrote fairy tales of how we'll live in castles 
Tight like Hansel and Gretal 
And grow old and settle in a town that we'll
Tighten with our marry day we got a love 
Like that like everyday like every way 
I cannot stay at yours tonight 
We can hold tight love bite 
And share some soul we can pick and roll 
Lose control and let me
Take it like how I let you break it don't forget 
We can get high on each other 
Insert a time for it through the night and
Back into the morning can't crack the habit 
You see I'm feening I'm needing some more 
And you got me grinning like it's
Money that I'm winning No way is this ending 
'cause you got me feeling purer than thou 
Show me how you do this thing cause
You got me singing like, yo, for real

He had me singing like some kinda opera shit 
I don't know where we went with it, 
It was like, I used to turn to him
And just whisper in his ear cause yo, 
I made him promises like I'd say ummm

I'll crown you king of this throne 
If you can take me home like run with no stripes 
Doesn't have to be tonight how's about
Early morning I'm talking AM we can beat the dawning 
Or just chill few time barriers can't help the whispers of I do but you
See through my proper test got me making game faces in London 
We say lacing you making sense this shit's intense I kinda
'cause you move me so I broke my role 
And got freaky with it You try to stave me 
With my own belt I ain't gonna lie I felt
The universe move you left me singing 
Like Opera like Cleopatra or Madam Butterfly 
You this shit's so good it brought tears
To my eyes I was like

I'm telling you man it's no lie I was like
I just yo, I, I couldn't even ignore parts of me I was like grabbing on him
And We were happy for a minute for true Opera We'd be like yo yo yo

Was that suppossed to happen all that foot tappin' 
Voice breakin' now I'm carving 
Karma Sutra diagrams with the headboard
Ignored the buzzer 4 times got up hard 
Telling lies even surprised myslef 
With my conniving ways I doved in like he meant
Survival like he was christened H20 
Like he could make the trees grow and the clouds spit snow 
He laid kisses on my chest
Like his name was Zorro got me saying 
Hell No when he said he had to go I was hiding clothes 
And play fighting with children
We were clashing Titans till weight 
We were losing I had Slum Village album on repeat 
We were knockin' boots to hip hop
Beats I even reached my maximum in my sleep 
Yo he had me singing like

Yo, for real I'm not lying listen up 
It was like I'm gonna break it down the truth is I got goose pimples now just
Thinking about that shit yo, Just his voice 
If I could hear his voice right now I'd answer the phone like, you know
What I mean yo listen if I knew where he was right now I'd find him 
We split We split ways we went about you know we went
About our business I want to know if he's making somebody else hit that 
Opera you know 'cause I ain't had gonna that in a
Minute it's like",Opera,2002
