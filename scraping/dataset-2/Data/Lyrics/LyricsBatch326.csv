Gram Parsons,"In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant mevision oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights  
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long as it would till the end

In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant mevision oh, Lord grant me speed

Another young man safely, strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy, his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant mevision oh, Lord grant me speed

The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father, and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant mevision oh, Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord, grant mevision oh, Lord grant me speed",In My Hour of Darkness [Remastered Album Version] [Version],1974
Gram Parsons,"A house, not a home
Was a picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown
While mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe

In anger he'd swear, his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent
Out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy
Inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod

Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low
Her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right

The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying
""Dear God, make it right""
He was smiling and singing
With tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night",The Angels Rejoiced Last Night,1976
Gram Parsons,"She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowed bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle
Down
So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there any more
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key

Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
But it hurts to see her running with that crowd down
And as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle
Down",Close Up the Honky Tonks,1976
Gram Parsons,"Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
And you're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

And that's why I'm lonely all the time",Crazy Arms,1976
Gram Parsons,"The warden led a prisoner 
Down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden 
Just before he reached my cell
""Let my guitar playing friend do my request.""

Want you sing me back home 
With a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
And take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

And I remember Sunday evening 
When a choir came in from town
Just to sing a few old gospel song
And I heard him tell the singers 
""There's a song my mama sang.
Could you sing it once before we move along?""",Sing Me Back Home,1976
Gram Parsons,"Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Somehow through the day I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait until
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Why did you go	 why did you go
Don't you know don't you know I need you",Sleepless Nights,1976
Gram Parsons,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
",Together Again,1976
Gram Parsons,"Was one thousand dollars wedding, supposed to be held the other day
And with all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes

Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way

I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
'Cause he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces

So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud

And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world

And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral

It's been a bad, bad day",$1000 Wedding,1982
Gram Parsons,"Got in a little  trouble at the county seat
Lawd, they put me in the jail house for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man
He said forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can
Said, that'll be cash on the barrelhead, son
You can take your choice you're twenty-one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you cause I'm a busy man

Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good hearted jailer with a six gun hip
He let me call long distance, she said number please
And no sooner than I told her, she shouted out at me

That'll be cash on the barrelhead son
Not part not half but the entire sum
No money down, no credit plan
Cause a little bird told me, you're a travellin' man

Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated, the driving caught my arm

Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts, lawd, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead I'll take you down the road",Cash on the Barrelhead,1982
Gram Parsons,"Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
One short year our love burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done?

Once we were as sweet and warm as the golden morning sun
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free

Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine
'Cause if you don't the devil will
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
Hearts on fire",Hearts on Fire,1982
Gram Parsons,"In South Carolina there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind

I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind

It's hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city, with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind

Keeps callin' me home, hickory wind",Hickory Wind,1982
Gram Parsons,"Darling, there is something I must tell you, you must know
But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real

'Cause I've been living deep in sin
I've been living blind
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone

Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry

A thief can only steal from you
He cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never care how much I've lied

So try to understand the pain
It takes so long when I explain
Please, don't you forget how much I've lied",How Much I've Lied,1982
Gram Parsons,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

I'm young, I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess,
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.",Love Hurts,1982
Gram Parsons,"Sometimes I get up sad when people treat me bad
I don't have time to think and so I get real mad
I pull my hair and find somewhere that I can be alone
But when I do I think of you and then I hurry home

Where I've got chores to keep me busy
A clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me
With the same last name as mine
And when the flowers wilt
A big old quilt to keep us warm
I've got the sun to see your blue eyes
And tonight you're in my arms

Somtimes I get on wild when fancy cars drive fast
Money don't get me down but I can't make it last
I bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stoned
But when I do I think of you and head myself back home

Where I've got chores to keep me busy
A clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me
With the same last name as mine
And when the flowers wilt
A big old quilt to keep us warm
I've got the sun to see your blue eyes

Gram Parsons,"Well a luxury liner, forty tons of steel
If I don't find my baby now then I guess I never will

I've been a long lost soul for a long long time
I've been around, everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome?
So do I, so do I

Well I'm the kind of guy that likes to make a livin' runnin' 'round
And I don't need a stranger to tell me that my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome?
So do I, so do I

Well a luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world can change the way I feel

Gram Parsons,"Oh,
Well, I was born in a little bitty tar hut
And they called me a man 'cause I couldn't
Keep my big, big mouth shut
So what's the sense of me sitting here leaving
When any ole day I might be even
And Lord knows that New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find the way
To get it out of my grain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
Well I wish there was a way that
I knew to get even
A way to get a lick in
A bobbin' and a weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a leavin'
You can do on a train

Well, I once knew a man who sailed around
The world twice
He would have made it three but he took
A lot of bad advice
So you just tell me what's the sense of me
Sittin' here leavin'
When any ole day I might get even
And Lord knows New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find a way to get it out
Of my brain

Well, I once knew a man who sailed around

A lot to do with it

But I'll tell you now the story isn't so
'Cause I've spent a lot of time down on the corner
Tasting tears and spilling whiskey on the floor

Such a shame that it's so hard for me to tell the truth to you
But by now you know the kind of man I am
So don't turn your pretty face away from me, dear
'Cause there's kids in this game don't understand

One more night like this would put me six feet under
But my heart would still be fighting for your love
Just remember little darling that I love you
And kiss the children for me please, before you go

So don't play this crazy game with me no longer

Gram Parsons,"Well I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of like the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me

How I still tremble at your name

That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit

Gram Parsons,"It was forty or fifty years ago
A big shot played with time
Mister Walker held the door
And both kept cord and line
Watched and checked on every single day
Building his own special cars
His very special way

Ooh, the new soft shoe
Ooh, the new soft shoe

And then walking through a southern road
I saw a shoeshine stand
A man was talking to a crowd
Holding slippers in his hands
Don't you know the same thing happens
Each and every day
Did you ever hear a song
That's hard to even play

Ooh, the new soft shoe
Ooh, the new soft shoe

Then a color TV broadcast
Snuck in from New Orleans
Showed me one more man who spoke
And wore bright blue and green
When you saw him talk his way
Was when he showed his claws
And spoke to people every day
Just to get applause

And never had to worry about it

Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer
Every night it's the same sad old procedure
The doorman winks at you on your way out
'Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning
And he's got something you can't live without
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt
Of an old love's fancy life that left you stranded in a dream

Gram Rabbit,"Now the devil said, â??Come on and walk with me.
I'll show you some things that you may not ever see.
It's time that I made myself real clear
And if things are cool, we'll stop off and grab a beer.

[Repeat: x4]
Ohhh 

Well, I never wanted to start any type of fight.
I always wanted to make things just real right.
But Jesus is mad and he's blaming it all on me,
When the problem is you, it's very plain to see.

[Repeat: x4]
Ohhh 

Now the horse out back has got a dirty mind,
And the man on the moon is drinking up all the shine.
The witch on the broom is fixing soon to crash,
But I'll be around to pick up all the trash.â??

Gram Rabbit,"[Chorus:]
Just past the new beginning
When everything was lost
I heard an angel singing
To those who paid the cost

She sang the last tomorrow
Was surely meant to be
Just past the new beginning
When everyone was free

The notes were drenched in sorrow
Her melody was soft
Her words spoke of a sinking ship
Which no one could get off

Her sadness wrapped around me
Her face began to blur
I turned to face the future
And the last thing that I heard

[Chorus]

To save the last tomorrow
To right where we've gone wrong
With hope we stand before you
To sing the angel song",Angel Song,2006

Or rather images I had of
Me did tell how different
From truth they were

I think I'm drowning
And the ocean is raging
My smile is frowning
And my insides are praying
And I've swallowed
All my yesterdays,
Killed my past
To follow the way
I think I'm drowning and
The ocean screams to me 
My name

I've fallen in
Or did I jump headfirst
Into this ocean
All I know is I cannot swim

I know that you'll dry all
My tears
I know you're beyond all
My fears
I know when I call out your name
My soul you save

",Jonah,1997
Grammatrain,"I wish that I could say I am a perfect man
One day I decided I would think on this,
I wish sometimes that I would not be who I am

not knowing if faith and pain could co-exist:
Could I ever on my own conceive
Of someone I did not know, but I need?
I must be made to be at peace and communion

'cause there must be some place somehow from where I have fallen
Chorus
I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real
Leaves me in conclusion that I know the way

the inconsistency of what I say I should be
Compared to what I am in actuallity
Though I am unable to always obey

my soul's hunger for a deeper life
Nothing in this world has satisfied
The weight of my misdeeds were crushing, blinding me
I still live with pain inside but now I see

- Solo -
- Chorus -


The peices of my life are scattered on the floor
I stared at them till I could take no more
I do not deserve to be set free
Forgiveness is what I despereately need


If it wasn't for the perfect blood was shed
Would I not be dead inside but I live instead
- Chorus (2x) -

believe through all my tearsi know my faith's still here

Gran Banda,"Es la historia de una voz
Templada por el blues;
Es el canto que arrastró
El hambre y el amor.
Y la música nació vestida de mujer.
El lamento que acunó
Su dulce oscura piel, 
Sentimientos en su son 
Gardenias del querer.
Y la música cantó por boca de mujer.
Alma de blues en su voz
Dando vida a la pasión,
Triste canción es su blues
Acaricia una oración. Nadie nunca comprendió
Su lucha y su dolor,
Nadie como ella sintió
La cárcel y el adiós.
Y la música lloró por Billie Holiday.

Gran Bel Fisher,"He threw it all away
But that's not the way he's seeing it
He picked a hell of a road to go his own way
He took a shortcut through a dead end to find a better place
He turned a hard life's last chance into amazing grace

[Chorus]
It was a cold day
He had a hot night
With a head full of this
And a soul needing that
And now you can't go back

From your cocoon you can turn into a butterfly
Oh, but only once
Watch it fly on by, bound for the brightest day
Is there glory in his story or will he just fade away?
Bold be the move he made but taken was the price he paid

While I'm living, why should I care, where I go, when I die?

And it's the easy breeze that's gonna blow your mind

The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You here a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit can split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claiming they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Nothing the clip, then give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around

As the best keep secret, I guess that I just leaked it

And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets

When it's phenomenal, you fiend to know who produced it 
Phrases frequently heard regarding new music 
Who's the kid rhymin? Where he from, who's the label? 
Now's a bad time to approach the turntables 
Try again next millennium or some other bag 
But when they jock a disc jock, it's another smash 
I just hit em wit it a minute ago 
On some exlusive promo to spin at the show 
Twenty-five hundred heads waitin on Black Star 
When J-Rocc throw your record on, you feel like Allah 
Visions of my image on the stage that I'm lookin at 
From the balcony to down front, I coulda took em back 
Every ear spectatin inside the palace 
Hype 'cause my likeness just might bless the stylus 
But that was when I was the limelight addict 
Nowadays, gettin music added is my habit 
The kind you wait on to debate on, or hate on 
Ever since the ad wit the street date on 
And now the future can't come quick enough 
Promotional bandits out stickin mad stickers up 
They got graffiti ? all city 
The anticipation keep clerks at Fat Beats way busy 
Long for the day of reckoning 
We make it so that when the album drop 
You cop nuff respect again 

[Chorus] 2x 
And now you want it like every five minutes 
You recognize vintage when I spit it 
From the Illadel side all the way to Venice 
No flaws, no blimish, you lust for it endless 

[Grand Agent] 
Word life, thought you heard it last month but wasn't sure 
Now you so salty, what you lent it to your cousin for? 
Not that you thought you would see it again 
Lent the mixtape you hate, either one that you lend 
Or is it the same joint that's on your box now? 
When your man's ridin shotgun, point out the style 
Then he turn it down, speakin on some pigeony shit 
Like the whip wasn't yours, like you let him forget 
So you scrape up some manhood and give him a look 
By the time you turn it back up, you recognize the hook 
Meanwhile inside your Honda, the gonga go clockwise 
'cause you from the markets where private stock risin 
Fall by the bounce 'cause you bounce hard and plastered 
It's the same joint, it just sound better mastered 
Try to tell brothas but you couln't recollect 
How my newest labors went, you just knew it was correct 
Caught a line here, a verse there 
But the flow, you couldn't do justice 
Told them ""Look, all I know is Grand came wit it 
He followed up like a publicist"" 
You're still thinkin 'bout the tape your cousin covered it 
But can you blame her, it is off the gauge 
Required listenin for livin in the Grand Age 
It's like that... 

Chorus 2x 

[Grand Agent] 
Now I'm like Wyatt Earp, come through, quiet your turf 
Get your city up in the arms wit the science I birth 
I'm oxygen, my coast to yours 
Line the meaning up wit the jetstream and get it across 
It's all about asthetics, the sound 
Satisfaction is my attribute 
The proper noun, hands down 
It's the retail spots known as the Grand Agent 
See me at the in-store, hear me at the station 
Feel me at the concert, live is the preferred way 
Fuck what you heard, only a herb'll say wordplay 
Now you found out the livest sound out but sort out 
That be mine, your shit wasn't thought out 

Chorus 2x 

And now you want it every five minutes....",Every Five Minutes,2001

betta flow the fuck outta here. It's my era

[ VERSE ]
Raise your glass make a toast to your last brick a hope
The Grand Agent, I don't throw jab or bag coke
This high-baller had this thing about his once sour
I got the right mind to rest in this eleventh hour
I can't see God rhyming in the same game, with what's his name
you know him when you see him, he caught the fame.
Like the bouquet inside the wedding
The same fame I be dodgin' cause it came two day ahead and
For them insecure assholes with no grease
I want to be a James Todd, not a Chochise
Happily ever after, but still black
and through the hood like the good wind chill fac(tor)
Breeze through with some G's and  tools
that may or may not, necessarily be pistols
See that's for me to know, for y'all to never learn
study Grand all you gettin' is a mirror burn
I'm from the same place that you came
from the insame come'a the brains behind the son
I was thought up, brought up to be the Agent
that hits the listenin booth, with this medicinal truth
Refinement assignment, I got to grind it all the way out
break day stay out, be only seen en route
To bigger better more focussed and fruitful
other LPs you can cop this one bought you
It opens you wide as the country side
from the city though, where they shot cops like videos
This is the sounds of the grounds I'm familiar with
some down low well-educated killa shit
You can't defeat what you can't provoke
'cause what you can't provoke won't even rumble you, humbled you
Like the slap box that went too far
hit you too hard and, now you want to hurt me
Well eat me, jerk me, that's all I got for you
save the grade school shit, this is doctoral
Black pain driven, type'a talk the walk
niggas to the uncharted lands to earn the same livin
Just hold hold my hands, just blast my record
true that I'm the man but it's all about the message
The moral to the chorus the theme of the beat is
Without a big dick, all your dreams incomplete. That's why

Straight-jacket rap for the lesser
You ain't sick, you just under pressure
I know the feeling, but flows need healing
I brought holistic health in the stealth
Form of a rhyme that you felt
Man listen, I'm in the pole position, on-call physician
Ballin on a mission to get y'all to listen
That all, until you're due I'm a pioneer to proof
Until it's customary that you're tryin to hear the truth
The truth meaning (Grand) the truth meaning (Agent)
The truth meaning the most amazin
Blind-side collision to hit rap ever
If you want to live through this, then build an ark yo, this is bad waether
Welcome to the Grand Age
Clear the stage, I'm original AND paid
It's man-made, but it's God-like
I be the image of perfection when I rhyme right
Concernin me only with the learning tree
Now you can hang from it or chop it down, but either way it's murder, see
How you can afford to 
The brutal truth that I brought through
To support, not abort you, forge you to help you
Before you felt me, I felt you 
Achin for a good song 
On some monk shit - hoods on
Prayin for a real rapper to get put on
Well, here I am and here goes nothin
The neighborhood ain't get no more good after mine introduction
Man, I don't give a fuck, I don't really
You can quote that from the Pope of North Philly
Only to my nature do I credit successors
I'm one of the few who the buck blesses
And I suggestes you get right with the Lord
Get your mics and your cords
I'm the new bandwagon, all aboard

Now what the fuck was you thinkin, huh?
Whatever it was, you wasn't eatin it and sleepin it
You wasn't deep in it

I'm like the Furious 5 rolled into one rumble
For recognition bless the mission, it's on
Me and the mic is Twin Hpye, we did it 'to the crowd'
Without publicity stunt the first
It's like mad other ways to make the news
If I want, I'm blessed with the curse
I play the hermit with the gun permit
That's a certified word to the media vermin
It's a thin line between yours and mine
You write articles, I birth rhymes
Don't go sniffin around, I'm not coke
I'm chemistry, I make ?Tone Poke poke?
Tape recorder invader, black male Sinead O'Connor
James Bond'll be the white Grand Agent, honor
The monarch cup when you taste it
Treat it like the East, face it
It's the truth, I'm the roof on fire
The sixth minister got to get on
The hell Run and DMC raised, born to sit on
Thrones and take microphones where they never been
To middleground, the worst and the best of men
I mean, what's a sword without two edges, after all
Look how many knew the legends, but they had to fall
For this to be my era, my epic
Tale of a journey from the feared to respected
Revered for the records that I wrote along the path
Here's a song you can have
I'm not one for small talk, that's a false start
Like the no-rap workday offends and irks me
Yo, I never was a regular dude
Just a Agent and Grand is my secular mood
Yo, yo, I never was a regular dude
Just a Agent and Grand is my secular mood

[ CHORUS ]",The Man Who Could Be King,2001
Grand Agent,"I run through your veins like James & The Famous Flames
Name is Grand Agent, this is how you play the game
Lay up in the cut like the babies in your nuts
Even though you want to make it born, never rush
Treat it like a trick and cover up your dick and
Feel what you spit and you might write a hit and
Maybe you won't, but I still think you dope
Not the type to hope that a brother drop the soap
Like the kid up in Half Baked, check the second Quest tape
""It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool.""
But worse though it's ignorant, not to make niggas rich
Even Chuck D sell his stuff on the internet
Now you want to get outta ya deal (Fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Don't let this rhyme change how the way you feel
Naaah, don't be mad 'cause it ain't all good
Believin' everything that you saw in the hood
It goes on and on into show-biz
With the dumb shit, on some ""Yo where you from kid?""
Now you represent that, though it's evident that
You talkin' 'bout places that you ain't never been at
In fact, I'ma say it again
Livin' by the pen is minglin' with mayhem - c'mon

[Chorus x2]
""Grand, Agent"" - ""North Philly's most wanted!""
 ""Grand Agent"" - ""Minglin with mayhem""
""Grand, Agent"" - ""North Philly's most wanted!""
 ""Grand Agent"" - ""Minglin with mayhem""

See I write my own rhymes, produce my own hits
And I'm never at a loss for new shit
I take a whole song and rape it
With so much finesse though, brothers can't hate it
And if they do then so what it's all love
What I'm about to say should be dug
Rap is my bitch and your bitch is my bitch and
Some of y'all is rich, but your rhymes ain't shit
So how do you frauds like me now?
I only hit grand slams, never will I foul
Brothers pop fly when they be catchin deals
I step to your crew 'cause I know they think for you
Yo, you can't hustle down this way
""Aiyyo Grand, I heard you moved to LA!""
You gotta know folks, a whole lotta folks
But if they whack, then it don't mean jack man
You better off on your own ock
Doin this for the love of Hip Hop
I gotta thousand rhymes books at the crib
Not for show though, it's just the way I live
See, me I want the show doe, some get no dough
It's up to you though, choose your own path bro
But remember when you live by the pen
Yo kid, you're minglin with mayhem

[Chorus]

Yo, it's deadlier than being truthful
Sometimes when you that and you black then they shoot you
But the norm it's not, if you perform a lot
Make sure it's not warm, but hot
In other words, earn your stardom
Never follow something other than your own calling
Rough and rugged, not for the timid
Inside the North Blunt Illadel city limits
Learned from the greats so the flakes and fakes
Gotta hold tight, yeah they just gotta wait
I'm not speakin to upset ya, I bet the lecture
Will enhance your whole two-bit
Education on this rap shit, you got it ass backwards
Gotta speak truth regardless of the facts kid
Word - but if preferred, you can be a bitch
To get a deal you be a eight-to-one pick
It's in the handle, can you handle your pen?
Yo, you're minglin with mayhem

It'sa-uh-uh-UHH!  Yknahmean?
Big up!  All my live niggaz
Keepin thangs in check, yknahms..

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" Sayin no names
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" They be stakin they claim
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" But I ain't ashamed
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" I fuck 'em the same

[Grand Agent]
It's a uh, yo, yo-yo.
When I be fuckin wit my Caucasoid bitch, word up
she pull the handcuffs out then I lock the herb up
Yeah, but when I fuck my African-American babe
she want her breakfast in bed, I make the white one the maid
Now I thrust with the force of course in either case
but the black one, she always want to be in my face
So it's easy to mistake the white one for hoe
and the professional way she execute the head blow
Now, I'm a be	-boy who enjoy his freedom
but It's nothing worse than having no bitches when ya need 'em
That's why I keep a pair nearby for my provisions
My wish is their command, my command is their religion
You think it's fucked up? Then it'll stay fucked up
Stay away if you feel you too good to suck nuts
I couldn't care less what you think of me
I got two bitches and them can't wait to get a drink of me

[Chorus]

[Grand Agent]
Met the nigga bitch cruisin in the white bitch car
told her give ya pussy to me, you'll be a big star
And I try to be a man of my word so what I did
is told the white bitch to work a double shift, I need the crib
Invited forty niggas to the spot no doubt
and broadcast the VHS of me bussin it out
Niggas all on the dick for like a good two weeks
tryin to know how a broke nigga keep two freaks
I met the white bitch at this open mic café
When I was done spillin my spill, she walked my way
and said the poetry was like Spanish fly in her drink
I could tell before dawn I would be in the pink
So it was just formality we chit chat for a while
On the way to her rest, I stop off for Lifestyles
She was bent totally, so I pushed the Ac' gunnin it
She passed out, that's when I met the black one and shit

[Chorus]

[Grand Agent]
It's a uh, what.
And listen up, one paid and one dead broke
One scared of the dick, the other live for the deep throat
One dropped out and one went to college
But they both want to be the only one, do the knowledge
No bitch can be everything to a king
The bitch who recognize that, she get promoted to queen
Otherwise, they'll keep wonderin why
to them my dick is lightnin and thunder, it rain when they cry
mad tears of joy and pain for the be	-boy Christ
who fell to temptation when I brought the bliss to they life
Yeah they hate to see me go even though I came to cum
It's not about the sex or the pain that I brung
We be buildin relations in between the ep's
exchangin our philosophies, gettin further in depth
But God forbid deeper than my dick go
Just enough to keep 'em happy like a faggot in Frisco
I got.. TWO bitchezzzzzzzz

Grand Agent,"[unknown singer]
Love is like water, flowin, flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction
It does, it does go the other way-ayyy-ayyy

[Grand Agent]
Ohhhhhhhhahhhhhh
End to end, end to end
Experience, experience, a new sensation

Some of this is factual, most of it ain't a lie
Two days before autumn, fifty-two after July
The sun shone bright, on time was her flight
Shot to LAX absolute, positive like
Only the shit-brown '82 Corrola could
Drive up inside arrivals, guess who lookin good
like five-six, archive thick, broad hips
I downshift and coast to the curb like word
She cheesin up while I easin up, double park
Throw the blinkers on, jump out, God bless her heart
Lookin like a tourist with the duffel and camera
Throw the bags in the back, we embrace then I slam the hatch
Right back where we left off
When we built for three weeks but then I stepped off
It just so happened, we met like ships passin
Rappin, no actual action
Now here she was live, all the way from back home 
Bodily counterpart to the voice over the phone
I spoke to for strong minutes, long distance
Even wrote a note with a quote of song in it
The bus thrust me sixty East of L.A.
The length to which I went to find words to say
3K, took me three days to get here
It took her six hours - that equal twenty-three years
Love won't let me wait a minute more
There's a bomb to the left of my passenger door
with a hundred-twenty hours to diffuse it or lose it
Got to need to relate to this queen like music
Or else, else or go from wealth to poor
Never that, take the prize and floor it to the shore
No small talk, give me a medium speech
We fitta slit the wrist the of time on Manhattan Beach

[Chorus: same unknown singer]
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction, it done
it done flown the other way

[Grand Agent]
Said the flight was peace, said she happy to see me
Said she want to check her aunt in the valley of Simi
Can't believe that she here, told I couldn't either
Right hand volleyin, gearshift receiver
Cause I play it by ear and she habitually plans
Twenty minutes we was parked fifty feet from the sand
Laid our troubles, down like bodies on the quilt
on the strand on September 21st and we built
Anatomical ebonics was the language
Speakin much silence cause we both thinkin bout the same shit
How we found ourselves back together
by a bond that was based solely on fair weather
Truth be told, we ain't even know each other
Tryin to prove that we did gave us somethin to show each other
And it can never be chumped again
We left the beach and jetted East towards the Comfort Inn
Sixty-two minute transit through Southern Cali
The hotel was near the rest in Moreno Valley
where I was stayin with a friend of the fam
who had made no concessions for a friend of the Grand
Agent at the front desk who checked us in
was Filipino, the housekeeper was Mexican
And, 217 was the room that she cleaned
After me and this queen has said and did everything
We traded baths, body massages, laughs
Future aspirations and accounts of the past
Quality time, probably rhyme material
The last breakfast: donuts, Tang, cereal
'Twas continental and the trip monumental
Did a gang of things coulda swore I wasn't into
But the swearin was impairin my ability
to give and receive love, plus humility

[Chorus]
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction, it done
it done flown the other way
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way..

[Grand Agent]
Than real time, I was movin faster
On a stage, with no Ceremony to Master
But then saw the lights like the rest of my life
Just mics, no whores, imagine wives on tours
wit Momsug, Like yo, ""How would you rather...?""
The cockiness to pop quiz Wiz didn't gather
Well not before she left anyway
But I feel like I can spill and reveal it any day
And never be too soon or too late
These thoughts and others, they run through me at the gate
while, she checkin bags bout to make her trip round
Back to a world minus me she was bound
And I was left behind to write this rhyme
It took time cause she bounced with a piece of my mind
Yeah, disappear she did, my new cohort
I was back on my solo and the whole airport
it felt vacant, I'm just another face in the pool
Now that my reflection is no more visible
Back to my MCI empty identity
I wrote before she bounced even like, ""Remember me!""
Yeah whateva ya do, darlin do
Cause whateva ya did took me outta what I'm all into
Even had me second guessin my profession
Her presence like a lesson that inspired such questions
What the fuck am I still rhymin for?
If I ain't blow yet, I must got bad timin or
it ain't for me, could that possibly be?
I even lost a battle to a lesser MC
Being the fresher MC, I got my little pride hurt
for holdin the mic, like the body inside of the skirt
And practically gave the title away
Cause in a spell I would have to say, ""L.A. farewell""

[Outro: same singer]
Love is like water, flowin

Uh-huh
Special dedication... to the bastards of the world
It's from the heart, Grand Agent

You know it's funny I ain't never had a child before
From what I hear though it's somethin magical for sure
Some in the know have told me it's like, no other rush
To feel oneself willing to receive so much
From what I hear though, you got about a dozen or so
And when they need you, we gotta let the government know
Daddy's not being supportive, so now the courts is
forever laced in recollections of your face
You wasn't checkin for me, I was just a case
Summoned you from down south, mouth full of foul taste
I heard about the drama, the shots ringin out
I know about the white bitch you was bringin to the house
Yeah, mommy put me on to all the wrongs done
But in absentia, who could defend ya? I'm your son
Not your lawyer, you innocent in my book of life
And yo I only came by to see what you look
And it's funny I could tell by the look of your lady
I was yours, cause she was raw plus she played me
like you taught her to work for you, that's my M.O.
It had to come from somewhere, Flow recognize Flow
I copped a Heineken and then like my money she slid
over to the jukebox, I followed her when she did
and asked if she knew where to find you, now mind you
I hadn't a clue what I'ma say if she do
And when she did, disappearin down a hall to fetch you
I lent the pen to my mind's eye to sketch you
Six foot three or maybe six foot two
No more guessin would a nigga ever be put through
And it's funny 'cause I wasn't really willing to bother
'til it hit me that I wasn't lookin for me a father
See, Allah's mine, and that fact padded the impact
when your lady returned and said I had to come back...

[Chorus: unknown singer]
You don't love me...
and I know now...
You don't love me...
cause you don't know how

[Grand Agent]
And it's funny, it's not that I feel fatherless
I guess what you never had is real hard to miss
My sister pop did what he could, when he could
And it's not like I was the only orphan in the hood
And damn sure wasn't at them schools I was sent to
for safekeepin in the dark, while mommy went through
her own plight, takin her demons to war
I only had dreams of home like bein on tour
where family's a foreign entity to the mind
Though mommy wrote me mad letters, I guess that's why I write better
It's funny, it came together unseen
But just between me and you, this rap shit is one dream
I had some others too, like givin wifey one or two
seeds, whe need that but not if I'ma do how you do
(Our love goes) back and forth and forth and
back from L.A. the last time I asked for her hand
And made it happen in less than a month
That's one less want, in less than like four I was out the door
I know that's probably more than you need to hear
But sayin all that to say you not bein here bred fear
I bled tears from the heart on my sleeve
A nigga needed you around like you couldn't believe
(for boys to man shit) I know life's coy and candid
No way to really plan it, that's why I don't demand shit
I'm sayin' though, but on the other hand
With flesh, you can't imagine what I'm willing to understand
So look, I'm twenty-something, with stupid money comin
I don't need you for nuttin why you still frontin?
It's beyond me
But I'm sure you know where to find me
So when you ready set your mind free

I can leap over lies and mash down doctrines

Haste makes waste
Walk don't run, take time to be safe
Fuck around and get egg all on your face
Pace yourself son, PACE

Pendant qu'on kiffe et qu'on apprécie nos plus belles vacances 
La vie est calme, il fait beau, il est 2 heures du mat' 
On est quelques sourires à partager notre insouciance 
C'est ce moment là , hors du temps, que la réalité a choisi 
Pour montrer qu'elle décide et que si elle veut elle nous malmène 
Elle a injecté dans nos joies comme une anesthésie 
Souviens-toi de ces sourires, ce sera plus jamais les mêmes 
Le temps s'est accéléré d'un coup et c'est tout mon futur qui bascule 
Les envies, les projets, les souvenirs, dans ma tête y'a trop de pensées qui se bousculent 
Le choc n'a duré qu'une seconde mais ses ondes ne laissent personne indifférent 
à‚Â« Votre fils ne marchera plus à‚Â», voilà ce qu'ils ont dit à mes parents 
Alors j'ai découvert de l'intérieur un monde parallèle 
Un monde où les gens te regardent avec gêne ou avec compassion 
Un monde où être autonome devient un objectif irréel 
Un monde qui existait sans que j'y fasse vraiment attention 
Ce monde-là vit à son propre rythme et n'a pas les mêmes préoccupations 
Les soucis ont une autre échelle et un moment banal peut être une très bonne occupation 
Ce monde là respire le même air mais pas tout le temps avec la même facilité 
Il porte un nom qui fait peur ou qui dérange : les handicapés 

On met du temps à accepter ce mot, c'est lui qui finit par s'imposer 
La langue française a choisi ce terme, moi j'ai rien d'autre à proposer 
Rappelle-toi juste que c'est pas une insulte, on avance tous sur le même chemin 
Et tout le monde crie bien fort qu'un handicapé est d'abord un être humain 
Alors pourquoi tant d'embarras face à un mec en fauteuil roulant 
Ou face à une aveugle, vas-y tu peux leur parler normalement 
C'est pas contagieux pourtant avant de refaire mes premiers pas 
Certains savent comme moi qu'y a des regards qu'on oublie pas 
C'est peut-être un monde fait de décence, de silence, de résistance 
Un équilibre fragile, un oiseau dans l'orage 
Une frontière étroite entre souffrance et espérance 
Ouvre un peu les yeux, c'est surtout un monde de courage 
Quand la faiblesse physique devient une force mentale 
Quand c'est le plus vulnérable qui sait où, quand, pourquoi et comment 
Quand l'envie de sourire redevient un instinct vital 
Quand on comprend que l'énergie ne se lit pas seulement dans le mouvement 
Parfois la vie nous teste et met à l'épreuve notre capacité d'adaptation 
Les 5 sens des handicapés sont touchés mais c'est un 6ème qui les délivre 
Bien au-delà de la volonté, plus fort que tout, sans restriction 
Ce 6ème sens qui apparaît, c'est simplement l'envie de vivre",6ème Sens,2006
Grand Corps Malade,"J'ai oublié de commencer ce texte par une belle introduction 
J'ai oublié de vous préparer avant d'entrer en action 
J'ai oublié de vous prévenir que je m'aperçois que dans ma vie 
J'ai oublié pas mal de choses si vous voulez mon avis 
J'ai oublié d'être sage, j'ai oublié d'être prudent 
J'ai oublié de me ménager et je me suis cassé les dents 
On m'a dit qu'on ne pouvait pas être et avoir été 
Moi j'ai oublié de faire attention a moi une nuit d'été 
J'ai oublié ce que c'est de courir derrière un ballon 
J'ai oublié d'être fort comme Achille et son talon 
J'ai oublié de remercier mes parents pour tout ce qu'ils ont fait 
Mais je suis pas doué pour ce genre de trucs, c'est pas moi le fils parfait 
J'ai oublié de prendre des risques dans l'ensemble de mon parcours 
Et quand je regarde derrière moi, parfois j'ai le souffle court 
J'ai traversé les années plus vite qu'on passe un péage 
J'ai oublié de prendre le temps de voir passer les nuages 
J'ai oublié d'écrire un texte sur la force de l'amitié 
Qui met l'amour à l'amende dont la faiblesse me fait pitié 
Y'a pas beaucoup de meufs qui m'ont vraiment fait me retourner 
J'ai oublié de tomber amoureux depuis quelques années 

J'ai oublié d'imaginer de quoi seront faites les années prochaines 
Et quand on me parle de l'avenir, j'ai tendance à  changer de chaîne 
J'ai oublié de payer mon amende pour m'être garé devant la station 
Tant pis pour moi, maintenant j'ai 30% de majoration 
J'ai oublié de faire en sorte que ce texte soit structuré 
Ça part dans tous les sens tant que ma feuille n'est pas saturée 
J'ai oublié de mettre des baggys et des ensembles en peau de pêche 
J'ai oublié d'avoir du style et c'est comme ça depuis la crèche 
J'ai oublié de chialer depuis un sacré bout de temps 
Une sorte de sécheresse ophtalmique, s'en est presque inquiétant 
Je sais pas si c'est normal mais c'est vrai que pour être franc 
La dernière fois que j'ai versé une larme, on achetait le pain avec des francs 
Dans ces vers, j'ai oublié d'arrêter de parler de moi 
J'ai oublié de m'oublier comme un premier samedi du mois 
J'ai l'impression de me mettre à  poil depuis bientôt un quart d'heure 
Sur ce coup là  j'ai oublié de garder pas mal de pudeur 
J'ai oublié de croire en l'existence d'un être supérieur 
J'aime pas les jeux de hasard j'ai toujours été mauvais parieur 
Par ailleurs, tant mieux, car je ne pourrais pas m'empêcher 
De me dépêcher de me sauver pour pas confesser mes péchés 
J'ai la pêche et à  cette façade, faut pas forcément te fier 
J'ai pas oublié d'être un con fier qu'a du mal à  se confier 
J'ai oublié de me plaindre quand ça en valait la peine 
J'ai oublié d'ouvrir les vannes quand la coupe était pleine 
A ce putain de texte, j'ai oublié de trouver une chute 
Comme un cascadeur qui saute d'un avion sans parachute 
Mais chut! Faut que je me taise, car maintenant c'est la fin 
A vrai dire pas tout à  fait car pour l'instant j'ai encore faim 
J'ai oublié d'écrire ce que je crois et ce que je pense vraiment 
J'ai oublié de croire à  ce que j'écris machinalement 
Mais finalement c'est peut-être mieux car se rappeler c'est subir 
J'ai oublié de penser qu'il était préférable de se souvenir 
J'ai oublié mon flow, j'ai oublié mon stylo 
J'ai oublié mon micro et j'ai oublié tous les mots 
J'ai oublié des tas de sujets, vous avez compris le concept 
Alors pour pas trop vous saoulez je vais m'arrêter d'un coup sec",J'ai Oublié,2006
Grand Corps Malade,"J'ai constaté que la douleur était une bonne source d'inspiration 
Et que les zones d'ombre du passé montrent au stylo la direction 
La colère et la galère sont des sentiments productifs 
Qui donnent des thèmes puissants, quoi qu'un peu trop répétitifs 
A croire qu'il est plus facile de livrer nos peines et nos cris 
Et qu'en un battement de cils un texte triste est écrit 
On se laisse aller sur le papier et on emploie trop de métaphores 
Pourtant je t'ai déjà  dit que tout ce qui ne nous tue pas nous rend plus forts 
C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui j'ai décidé de changer de thème 
D'embrasser le premier connard venu pour lui dire je t'aime 
Des lyrics pleins de vie avec des rimes pleines d'envie 
Je vois, je veux, je vis, je vais, je viens, je suis ravi 
C'est peut-être une texte trop candide mais il est plein de sincérité 
Je l'ai écrit avec une copine, elle s'appelle Sérénité 
Toi tu dis que la vie est dure et au fond de moi je pense pareil 
Mais je garde les idées pures et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 
Evidemment on marche sur un fil, chaque destin est bancal 
Et l'existence est fragile comme une vertèbre cervicale 
On t'a pas vraiment menti, c'est vrai que parfois tu vas saigner 
Mais dans chaque putain de vie, y'a tellement de choses à  gagner 

J'aime entendre, raconter, j'aime montrer et j'aime voir 
J'aime apprendre, partager, tant qu'y a de l'échange y'a de l'espoir 
J'aime les gens, j'aime le vent, c'est comme ça je joue pas un rôle 
J'ai envie, j'ai chaud, j'ai soif, j'ai hâte, j'ai faim et j'ai la gaule 
J'espère que tu me suis, dans ce que je dis y'a rien de tendancieux 
Quand je ferme les yeux, c'est pour mieux ouvrir les cieux 
C'est pas une religion, c'est juste un état d'esprit 
Y'a tellement de choses à  faire et ça maintenant je l'ai compris 
Chaque petit moment banal, je suis capable d'en profiter 
Dans la vie j'ai tellement de kifs que je pourrai pas tous les citer 
Moi en été je me sens vivre, mais en hiver c'est pareil 
J'ai tout le temps l’œil du tigre, et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 

C'est pas moi le plus chanceux mais je me sens pas le plus à  plaindre 
Et j'ai compris les règles du jeu, ma vie c'est moi qui vais la peindre 
Alors je vais y mettre le feu en ajoutant plein de couleurs 
Moi quand je regarde par la fenêtre je vois que le béton est en fleur 
J'ai envie d'être au coeur de la ville et envie d'être au bord de la mer 
De voir le delta du Nil et j'ai envie d'embrasser ma mère 
J'ai envie d'être avec les miens et j'ai envie de faire des rencontres 
J'ai les moyens de me sentir bien et ça maintenant je m'en rends compte 
Je voulais pas écrire un texte à petite maison dans la prairie à
Mais j'étais de bonne humeur et même mon stylo m'a souri 
Et puis je me suis demandé si j'avais le droit de pas être rebelle 
D'écrire un texte de slam pour affirmer que la vie est belle 
Si tu me chambres je m'en bats les reins, parfois je me sens inattaquable 
Parce que je suis vraiment serein et je suis pas prêt de péter un câble 
La vie c'est gratuit je vais me resservir et tu devrais faire pareil 
Moi je me couche avec le sourire et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 

La vie c'est gratuit je vais me resservir et ce sera toujours pareil 
Moi je me couche avec le sourire et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles",Je Dors sur Mes 2 Oreilles,2006
Grand Corps Malade,"Le jour se lève sur notre grisaille, sur les trottoirs de nos ruelles et sur nos tours
Le jour se lève sur notre envie de vous faire comprendre à tous que c'est à notre tour
D'assumer nos rêves, d'en récolter la sève pour les graver dans chaque mur de pierre
Le jour se lève et même si ça brûle les yeux, on ouvrira grand nos paupières
Il a fait nuit trop longtemps et avancer sans lumière nous a souvent fait tâtonner
Personne à pardonner, si on est là aujourd'hui, c'est juste qu'on n'a pas abandonné
On a cherché la lueur de l'aube en sachant qu'elle avait la couleur de l'espoir
On s'est armé de nos stylos pour écrire nous-mêmes la suite de toute cette histoire
Le jour se lève, sort de sa grève, c'est grave à quel point la nuit a été agitée
On en a de belles à raconter, même si j'imagine que ça sera sûrement loin de tes JT
Le soleil éclaire notre papier qu'on avait gratté dans l'ombre pendant toute la nuit
La chaleur fait couler l'encre, nos mots quittent nos cahiers, nos voix sortent de l'ennui
Alors nous allons prendre la parole, monter sur scène pour un moment, j'espère que t'en as conscience
Fini la patience et la méfiance, on s'offre simplement avec l'écriture une renaissance
Le jour se lève et son glaive de lave nous lave des peines et douleurs du passé
Notre avenir est lancé, tu nous écouteras et diras franchement ce que t'en as pensé
Le jour se lève et la joie se livre, la soif se lit sur nos lèvres, tu devrais nous suivre
Si notre heure est brève, nous allons quand même la vivre
Nous ne sommes pas bons élèves, mais l'envie nous enivre
Alors à ton tour ouvre les yeux, approche-toi et observe avec curiosité
Le souffle et l'enthousiasme d'une brigade de poètes sortis tout droit de l'obscurité
Ne prends pas ça pour de l'arrogance, mais on sent que c'est notre heure et ça fait du bien
Notre passion va nous nourrir et je vais retrouver le sourire dans le regard de tous les miens
Le jour se lève, on le doit peut-être qu'à nous et quand je dis ça, c'est pas juste une métaphore
Le jour se lève et si ça se trouve, c'est uniquement parce qu'on l'a espéré assez fort

Le jour se lève sur notre grisaille, sur les trottoirs de nos ruelles et sur nos tours
Le jour se lève sur notre envie de vous faire comprendre à tous que c'est à notre tour
Notre futur est incertain, c'est vrai que ces deux mots-là vont toujours de pair
Mais notre jour s'est bien levé, dorénavant il sera difficile de nous faire taire",Le Jour Se Lève,2006
Grand Corps Malade,"J'crois qu'les histoires d'amour, c'est comme les voyages en train
Et quand j'vois tous ces voyageurs, parfois, j'aimerais en être un
Pourquoi tu crois qu'tant d'gens attendent sur le quai d'la gare?
Pourquoi tu crois qu'on flippe autant d'arriver en retard?

Les trains démarrent souvent au moment où on s'y attend le moins
Et l'histoire d'amour t'emporte sous l'œil impuissant des témoins
Les témoins c'est tes potes, qui t'disent au revoir sur le quai
Et regardent le train s'éloigner avec un sourire inquiet

Toi aussi, tu leur fais signe, et t'imagines leurs commentaires
Certains pensent que tu t'plantes et qu't'as pas les pieds sur terre
Chacun y va d'son pronostic sur la durée du voyage
Pour la plupart, le train va dérailler dès l'premier orage

Le grand amour change forcément ton comportement
Dès l'premier jour, faut bien choisir ton compartiment
Siège couloir ou contre la vitre, il faut trouver la bonne place
Tu choisis quoi? Une love story d'première ou d'seconde classe?

Dans les premiers kilomètres, tu n'as d'yeux qu'pour son visage
Tu calcules pas derrière la fenêtre le défilé des paysages
Tu t'sens vivant, tu t'sens léger, et tu n'vois pas passer l'heure
T'es tellement bien qu't'as presque envie d'embrasser le contrôleur

Mais la magie ne dure qu'un temps, et ton histoire bat d'l'aile
Toi tu dis qu'tu n'y es pour rien et qu'c'est sa faute à elle
Le ronronnement du train te saoule et chaque virage t'écœure
Faut qu'tu t'lèves, que tu marches, tu vas t'dégourdir le cœur

Et le train ralentit, c'est déjà la fin d'ton histoire
En plus t'es comme un con, tes potes sont restés à l'autre gare
Tu dis au revoir à celle que t'appelleras désormais ton ex
Dans son agenda, sur ton nom, elle va passer un coup d'Tipp-ex

C'est vrai qu'les histoires d'amour, c'est comme les voyages en train
Et quand j'vois tous ces voyageurs, parfois, j'aimerais en être un
Pourquoi tu crois qu'tant d'gens attendent sur le quai d'la gare?
Pourquoi tu crois qu'on flippe autant d'arriver en retard?

Pour beaucoup, la vie s'résume à essayer d'monter dans l'train
À connaître ce qu'est l'amour et s'découvrir plein d'entrain
Pour beaucoup, l'objectif est d'arriver à la bonne heure
Pour réussir son voyage et avoir accès au bonheur

Il est facile de prendre un train, encore faut-il prendre le bon
Moi j'suis monté dans deux-trois rames, mais c'était pas l'bon wagon
Car les trains sont capricieux et certains sont inaccessibles
Et je n'crois pas tout l'temps qu'avec la SNCF c'est possible

Il y a ceux pour qui les trains sont toujours en grève
Et leurs histoires d'amour n'existent que dans leurs rêves
Et y'a ceux qui foncent dans l'premier train sans faire attention
Et forcément ils descendront déçus à la prochaine station

Y a celles qui flippent de s'engager parce qu'elles sont trop émotives
Pour elles, c'est trop risqué d's'accrocher à la locomotive
Et y'a les aventuriers qu'enchaînent voyage sur voyage
Dès qu'une histoire est terminée, ils attaquent une autre page

Moi après mon seul vrai voyage, j'ai souffert pendant des mois
On s'est quittés d'un commun accord, mais elle était plus d'accord que moi
Depuis j'traîne sur le quai, j'regarde les trains au départ
Y a des portes qui s'ouvrent, mais dans une gare j'me sens à part

Il paraît qu'les voyages en train finissent mal en général
Si pour toi c'est l'cas, accroche-toi et garde le moral
Car une chose est certaine, y'aura toujours un terminus
Maintenant tu es prévenu, la prochaine fois tu prendras l'bus",Les Voyages en Train,2006
Grand Corps Malade,"Des années des années à repenser à ruminer
Mais impossible d'accepter que cette aventure soit terminée
Miss Acacia hante mon esprit quoique je fasse quoique je veuille
Je vais la retrouver elle et celui qui m'a crevé l’œil
Alors oui je suis de retour et je viens bouleverser l'histoire
Je ne resterai pas à Edimbourg me laisser croupir de désespoir
Je ne peux plus me satisfaire de ne la voir que dans mes rêves
Je suis venu la récupérer de toute façon si je n'essaye pas j'en crève
Pour elle j'ai traversé toute l'Europe en me remémorant le son de sa voix

Et en me souvenant de son doux visage
Dire que je vais la revoir une nouvelle fois
Je vais revoir aussi mon pire ennemi
Le petit nabot ce Little Jack

Et en m'approchant de lui j'ai tout de suite ré-entendu le fameux tic tac
Miss Acacia m'a reconnu à ma voix et j'ai compris que Jack se laisserait pas faire
J'ai retrouvé celle que j'aimais mais j'ai aussi retrouvé mon adversaire.
Je l'ai regardé de mon seul œil et j'ai tout de suite senti monter la pression

J'ai vu la haine dans les yeux de Jack, il fallait qu'on ait une discussion
Je lui expliquais que je n'étais plus le même et que le fait d'être borgne m'avait changé
Moi aussi j'ai souffert d'être différent mais je ne suis pas venu là pour me venger

Je lui ai fait du mal dans le passé puis il m'a crevé l’œil
Je crois qu'on est quitte et si je suis revenu
C'est pour une seule chose il faut que Miss Acacia le quitte
Je comprends que Jack me déteste
Pendant ces années j'ai été la cause de tous ses malheurs
Humiliation persécution je lui en ai fait voir de toutes les douleurs
Mais c'est uniquement de sa faute
Dès le premier jour de classe il a eu tort de me parler de ma Miss Acacia

Il avait signé là son arrêt de mort
Finalement on a un point commun c'est que lui et moi on ferait tout pour elle
Mais maintenant on est adultes finies les petites bagarres et les querelles

Je veux rentrer à Edimbourg et que Miss Acacia m'accompagne
Je propose à Jack un duel à la régulière
Maintenant que le meilleur gagne",Le Retour de Joe,2007
Grand Corps Malade,"Cela fait maintenant plusieurs années
Que dans cette école je me sens chez moi
Et c'est vrai dans la cours de récréation
C'est souvent moi qui fais la loi
Tous les autres élèves me respectent
Il y en à sûrement beaucoup qui me craignent
J'ai mes repères mes habitudes
Mes certitudes sur lesquelles je règne
Alors c'est vrai j'aime pas beaucoup le changement
Pour moi la vie c'est la stabilité
Je voudrais effacer littéralement
Tout ce qui pourrait menacer mon autorité
J'ai fais ce qu'il faut depuis longtemps
Et dans mon entourage je n'ai plus de rivaux
Mais à l'école depuis peu de temps
J'aime pas trop ça y a un nouveau

Il est tout petit un air gentil
Moi j'ai vraiment envie de lui mettre des claques
Je crois qu'il y a pas plus bizarre que lui
Quand il s'approche ça fait tic-tac
Un bruit d'horloge incessant
Il paraît que ça vient de son cœur
Moi ça me dérange
Et puis j'ai l'impression qu'il connaît rien de la vie
Moi le nouveau je le trouve étrange
Il a de drôle d'occupation souvent
Il couve des œufs dans la manche de son pull
Alors dès que je peux à la récréation
Je les lui casse sur le crâne sans aucun scrupule
Nous n'avons vraiment rien en commun sauf
Une chose découverte avec horreur
Il est amoureux de la même fille que moi
Il n'aurais jamais dû c'est une grave erreur

Cette fille c'est la petite chanteuse
C'est ma petite amie depuis longtemps
Elle s'appelle Miss Acacia
Et elle chante en moi à chaque instant
Depuis peu malheureusement
Elle est repartie dans son pays l'Andalousie
Et le nouveau qui ose me parler d'elle
Est en train de décupler ma jalousie

La présence inutile de ce nabot renforce
La cruelle absence de mon amour
Il semble l'aimer presque autant que moi
Et si ça continue je crois bien qu'un jour
Ce n'est pas ses œufs mais son cœur en bois
Que sur son crâne je vais briser
Pour qu'il ne soit plus jamais capable d'aimer
C'est bien son cœur que je dois viser",Thème de Joe,2007
Grand Corps Malade,"À l'arrivée du mois de décembre 
J'ai bien regardé
La hauteur de ciel descendre
Et l'hiver arriver

J'étais presque content de le voir
En l'observant se déployer
J'ai mis une veste au-dessus de ma veste
Pour pas trop cailler

J'ai vu la nuit qui tombait tôt
Mais les gens qui marchaient plus vite
J'ai vu la chaleur des bistrots
Avec de la buée sur les vitres

Là-dessus la nature est fidèle
J'ai vu le jour se lever tard
J'ai vu les guirlandes de Noël
Qui me foutent le cafard
J'ai aimé avoir les mains gelées
Pour les mettre au fond de mes poches
J'ai adoré marcher dehors
Quand tu sais que la maison est proche

J'ai souris bêtement 
En voyant qu'il n'y avait plus 
De fleurs sur les balcons
J'ai regardé le ciel tout blanc
Y avait même des flocons

Certains matins j'ai vu que le givre 
Avait squatté derrière les fenêtres
J'ai vu les gens revenir du ski
Avec la marque des lunettes

Je commençais juste à m'y habituer
Mais les jours ont rallongé
J'ai compris que le printemps
Allait emménager

Le mois de mars avait tracé 
En un battement de cils
Et on m'a dit qu'en avril 
Faut pas se découvrir d'un fil

Mas moi j'ai peur de rien
Alors malgré les dictons vieillots
J'ai enlevé une de mes deux vestes
Pour pas avoir trop chaud

J'ai vu les arbres avoir des feuilles
Et les filles changer de godasses
J'ai vu les bistrots ouvrir plus tard
Avec des tables en terrasses

Y avait pleins de couples qui s'embrassaient
C'est les hormones, ça réagit
C'est la saison des amours 
Et la saison des allergies

C'est vrai qu j'ai eu le nez qui coule
Et je me suis frotté les yeux 
Mais j'ai aimé la chair de poule
Pendant un coup de vent affectueux

Sur les balcons ça bourgeonnait
J'ai ri bêtement à cette vision
J'ai regardé le ciel bleu-pâle
Y avait même des avions

Ma factrice a ressorti le vélo
J'étais content pour elle
Content aussi pour le daron
Qui aime le retour des hirondelles

Je commençais juste à m'y habituer
Mais le thermomètre a augmenté
J'ai compris ce qui nous pendait au nez
C'était l'été

Au mois de juin on change de teint
Fini d'être albino
C'est la période des examens
Et puis celle de Roland Garros

Ça sent les vacances à plein nez
Il va être l'heure de se tirer
Moi j'ai enlevé ma dernière veste
Pour pas transpirer

J'ai vu qu'il faisait encore jour
Même après le début du film
Pour ceux qui ont des poignées d'amour
Il est trop tard pour le régime

Les mecs sont assez excités
Et ça les préoccupe
Que les filles sortent leurs décolletés
Et leurs mini-jupes

J'ai aimé rechercher l'ombre
Quand il y avait trop de soleil
J'ai aimé dormir sans la couette
Pour rafraîchir le sommeil

Sur les balcons c'était la jungle
Il y avait plein de fleur et de feuillage
J'ai regardé le ciel tout bleu
Il y avait même pas de nuages

J'ai adoré conduire la nuit
La vitre ouverte en grand
Avec le bras gauche de sorti
Qui fait un bras de fer contre le vent

Je commençais juste à m'y habituer
Mais j'ai vu une fleur fanée
J'ai compris que l'automne 
Était déterminé

C'est surtout à partir d'octobre
C'est la saison la plus austère
Moi bizarrement je la trouve noble
C'est celle qui a le plus de caractère

J'ai vu les feuilles qui tournoyaient
Comme des ballons de baudruche
J'ai remis une de mes vestes
Avec une capuche

J'ai vu la pluie, j'ai vu le vent
Les rayons de soleil malades
J'ai vu les K-ways des enfants
Qui partent aux châtaignes en ballade

J'ai marché dans les feuilles mortes
Et sur les trottoirs mouillés
J'ai vu les parcs changer de couleurs
Ils étaient tout rouillés

J'ai aimé les lumières de la ville
Qui se reflètent dans les flaques
Et les petites bourrasques de vent
Qui mettent les brushings en vrac

Sur les balcons y avait que des branches
Sans feuilles et sans raisons
J'ai regardé le ciel tout gris
Y avait même plus d'horizon

Et puis l'hiver est revenu
Puis les saisons se sont perpétuaient
Les années passent, la vie aussi
On commençait juste à s'y habituer

On est les témoins impuissants
Du temps qui trace, du temps qui veut
Que les enfants deviennent des grands
Et que les grands deviennent des vieux",4 Saisons,2008
Grand Corps Malade,"En fait, ça fait un moment que se croisent dans ma tête 
Des mots et des douceurs qui pourraient faire un texte 
Un truc un peu différent, je crois que ça parlerait d'elle 
Faut avouer que dans mon quotidien, elle a mis un beau bordel 

Mais j'ai un gros souci, j'ai peur que mes potes se marrent 
Qu'ils me disent que je m'affiche, qu'ils me traitent de canard 
C'est cette pudeur misogyne, croire que la fierté part en fumée 
Quand t'ouvres un peu ton cœur, mais moi cette fois je veux assumer 

J'ai un autre problème, il est peut-être encore plus lourd 
C'est que t'as pas droit à l'erreur quand t'écris un texte d'amour 
Moi, les trois prochains couplets, je voudraient que ça soit des bombes 
Si j'écris un texte sur elle, je voudrais que ça soit le plus beau du monde 

Elle mérite pas un texte moyen, j'ai la pression, ça craint 
Fini de faire l'intéressant, avec mes voyages en train 
Là c'est loin d'être évident, moi je sais pas comment on fait 
Pour décrire ses sentiments, quand on vit avec une fée 

Il faut avouer qu'elle a des yeux, ils sont même pas homologués 
Des fois ils sont verts, des fois jaunes, je crois même que la nuit ils sont violets 
Quand je m'enfonce dans son regard, je perds le là, je n'touche plus le sol 
Je me perds profondément, et j'oublie exprès ma boussole 

Depuis que je la connais, je ressens des trucs hallucinants 
Je me dis souvent que j'ai eu de la chance de lui avoir plu, sinon 
J'aurais jamais su qu'un rire pouvait arrêter la Terre de tourner 
J'aurais jamais su qu'un regard pouvait habiller mes journées 

Je comprends pas tout ce qui se passe, y a pleins de trucs incohérents 
Depuis qu'elle est là rien n'a changé, mais tout est différent 
Elle m'apporte trop de désordre, et tellement de stabilité 
Ce que je préfère c'est sa force, mais le mieux c'est sa fragilité 

Ce n'est pas un texte de plus, ce n'est pas juste un poème 
Parfois elle aime mes mots, mais cette fois c'est elle que mes mots aiment 
Je l'ai dans la tête comme une mélodie, alors mes envies dansent
Dans notre histoire rien n'est écrit, mais tout sonne comme une évidence 

J'ai redécouvert comme ça réchauffe d'avoir des sentiments 
Mais si tu me dis que c'est beaucoup mieux de vivre sans, tu mens 
Alors je les mets en mots et tant pis si mes potes me chambrent 
Moi je m'en fous, chez moi y a une sirène qui dort dans ma chambre 

J'avais une vie de chat sauvage, elle l'a réduite en cendres 
J'ai découvert un bonheur tout simple, c'est juste qu'on aime être ensemble 
On ne calcule pas les démons du passé, on n'a pas peur d'eux 
Moi si un jour j'suis un couple, je voudrais être nous deux 

Y a des sourires et des soupirs, y a des fou rires à en mourir 
On peut s'ouvrir et s'en rougir, déjà se nourrir de nos souvenirs 
Les pièges de l'avenir nous attendent, mais on n'a pas peur d'eux
Moi si un jour j'suis un couple, je voudrais être nous deux 

Et si c'est vrai que les mots sont la voix de l'émotion 
Les miens prennent la parole pour nous montrer sa direction 
J'ai quitté le quai pour un train spécial, un TGV palace 
On roule à mille kilomètres à l'heure, au dessus de la mer, en première classe

Grand Corps Malade,"Je suis pas au bout de mes surprises, là-dessus, y a aucun doute
Et tous les jours je continue d'apprendre les codes de ma route
Les codes de ma route, les codes de ma route
Les codes de ma route ont soudain été très surprenants
Nouvelle signalisation, nouveaux panneaux, nouveaux tournants
J'ai bien alerté mes rétines pour voir tout ce qu'y avait à voir
Et j'ai marché en observant, du côté chance de l'histoire
On a d'abord slamé dans des bars, c'étaient nos tours de Babel
L'histoire est devenue aventure et l'aventure est devenue belle
Avec un mélange de rencontres, d'envies et de prises de risques
Qui aurait cru que c'était possible, on a même sorti un disque
Comme tout est allé vite, là, je décide de me poser
Quelques s'condes, me retourner pour essayer d'analyser
Une année mouvementée pleine de surprises et d'actions
Où, avec le public, on a échangé des émotions
Alors, j'essaie de réaliser, de ressentir, de prendre conscience
De tout ce que ça m'a apporté d' recevoir cette reconnaissance
Je me souviens d'une farandole de sentiments même si
Le plus fort, c'est quand quelqu'un du public me dit merci
Ça réchauffe le ventre de savoir qu'on a fait du bien
Juste pour un petit moment, modestement, on crée du lien
Puis, je me dis que je me suis pas trop trompé quand j'ai misé
Sur toutes ces heures fragilisées par un auditoire tamisé

Y avait plein de gens qui m'écoutaient, j'ai vu des oreilles plein leurs yeux
Un tas de cœurs bien intentionnés, y avait des jeunes et puis des vieux
Ils étaient là, ils m'attendaient même à l'aut' bout d'la France
Ils m'ont offert un bout d'histoire où j'ai marché du côté chance

La belle aventure a pris de drôles de proportions
Difficile de prévoir de pareilles mensurations
Bien sûr, on y croyait mais personne ne pensait
Qu'y aurait des textes de slam au programme du bac français
Tant d'événements inattendus, parsemés, forcément
Et j'ai slamé, slalomant entre surprises et étonnements
Et si je reprends l'horloge de mon unique journée
Il est midi quarante quand s'achève la tournée
Cette première tournée m'a offert tant d'images
De plaisirs, de voyages, de sourires, de visages
Des témoignages qui ont gonflé mes poumons de gratitude
Voir un public se lever, on n'en prend jamais l'habitude
Alors merci pour votre écoute et pour vos applaudissements
Ils résonnent pour notre équipe comme les plus beaux encouragements
Merci Renaud et Gaétan, et merci à Timothée
J'ai compris, dans vos yeux d'enfants, qu'mes mots avaient de l'utilité
On en a fait des kilomètres, vu des péages et vu des gares
Pour essayer de mieux s'connaître, à la recherche de vos regards
Des patelins aux grandes villes, des petites salles aux festivals
De mes envies à mon réel, de Saint-Denis à Montréal
Cent vingt dates de concert, avec un public aux p'tits soins
Ça laisse quelques souvenirs, t'as qu'à demander aux musiciens
Et comme j'suis un gamin, bah j'ai envie d'recommencer
Et quoi qu'y se passe demain, je me souviendrai de l'année passée

Y avait plein de gens qui m'écoutaient, j'ai vu des oreilles plein leurs yeux
Un tas de cœurs bien intentionnés, y avait des jeunes et puis des vieux
Ils étaient là, ils m'attendaient même à l'aut' bout d'la France
Ils m'ont offert un bout d'histoire où j'ai marché du côté chance

Quelques dédicaces pour les acteurs de cette tournée
Philippe, Jean, Florence, Nathalie, Hélène, Hervé
Merci Hamid, Paco, Yannick et Rony
J'oublie pas James, Djamel, Raf, Karim et Ouali
Le noyau dur Yakeen, S Petit Nico et Feed Back
Merci Jean-Phi et Jean-Rachid, on partage tous le même trac
Comte de Bouderbala et John Pucc', c'est toujours un plaisir
De vous avoir sur scène et rendez-vous à l'Amazir

Grand Corps Malade,"J'avoue que c'est bon de se barrer à la mer ou à la campagne
Quand tu ressens ce besoin, quand ton envie de verdure t'accompagne
Nouvelles couleurs, nouvelles odeurs, ça rend les sens euphoriques
Respirer un air meilleur ça change de mon bout de périphérique
Est-ce que t'as déjà bien écouté le bruit du vent dans la forêt
Est-ce que t'as déjà marché pieds nus dans l'herbe haute, je voudrais
Surtout pas représenter l'écolo relou à quatre centimes
Mais la nature nourrit l'homme et rien que pour ça faut qu'on l'estime
Donc la nature je la respecte, c'est peut-être pour ça que j'écris en vers
Mais c'est tout sauf mon ambiance, j'appartiens à un autre univers
Si la campagne est côté face, je suis un produit du côté pile
Là où les apparts s'empilent, je suis enfant de la ville
Je sens le cœur de la ville qui cogne dans ma poitrine
J'entends les sirènes qui résonnent mais est-ce vraiment un crime
D'aimer le murmure de la rue et l'odeur de l'essence
J'ai besoin de cette atmosphère pour développer mes sens

Je suis un enfant de la ville, je suis un enfant du bruit
J'aime la foule quand ça grouille, j'aime les rires et les cris
J'écris mon envie de croiser du mouvement et des visages
Je veux que ça claque et que ça sonne, je ne veux pas que des vies sages
Je suis un enfant de la ville, je suis un enfant du bruit
J'aime la foule quand ça grouille, j'aime les rires et les cris
J'écris mon envie de croiser du mouvement et des visages
Je veux que ça claque et que ça sonne, je ne veux pas que des vies sages

Je trempe ma plume dans l'asphalte, il est peut-être pas trop tard
Pour voir un brin de poésie même sur nos bouts de trottoirs
Le bitume est un shaker où tous les passants se mélangent
Je ressens ça à chaque heure et jusqu'au bout de mes phalanges
Je dis pas que le béton c'est beau, je dis que le béton c'est brut
Ça sent le vrai, l'authentique, peut-être que c'est ça le truc
Quand on le regarde dans les yeux, on voit bien que s'y reflètent nos vies
Et on comprend que slam et hip-hop ne pouvaient naître qu'ici
Difficile de traduire ce caractère d'urgence
Qui se dégage et qu'on vit comme une accoutumance
Besoin de cette agitation qui nous est bien familière
Je t'offre une invitation pour cette grande fourmilière
J'suis allé à New York, je me suis senti dans mon bain
Ce carrefour des cultures est un dictionnaire urbain
J'ai l'amour de ce désordre et je ris quand les gens se ruent
Comme à l'angle de Broadway et de la 42ème rue

Je suis un enfant de la ville, je suis un enfant du bruit
J'aime la foule quand ça grouille, j'aime les rires et les cris
J'écris mon envie de croiser du mouvement et des visages
Je veux que ça claque et que ça sonne, je ne veux pas que des vies sages
Je suis un enfant de la ville, je suis un enfant du bruit

J'écris mon envie de croiser du mouvement et des visages
Je veux que ça claque et que ça sonne, je ne veux pas que des vies sages

Je me sens chez moi à Saint-Denis, quand y'a plein de monde sur les quais
Je me sens chez moi à Belleville ou dans le métro New-yorkais
Pourtant j'ai bien conscience qu'il faut être sacrément taré
Pour aimer dormir coincé dans 35 mètres carrés
Mais j'ai des explications, y'a tout mon passé dans ce bordel
Et face à cette folie, j'embarque mon futur à bord d'elle
À bord de cette pagaille qui m'égaye depuis toujours
C'est beau une ville la nuit, c'est chaud une ville le jour
Moi dans toute cette cohue je promène ma nonchalance
Je me ballade au ralenti et je souris à la chance
D'être ce que je suis, d'être serein, d'éviter les coups de surin
D'être sur un ou deux bons coups pour que demain sente pas le purin
Je suis un enfant de la ville donc un fruit de mon époque
Je vois des styles qui défilent, enfants du melting-pot
Je suis un enfant tranquille avec les poches pleines d'espoir
Je suis un enfant de la ville, ce n'est que le début de l'histoire",Enfant de La Ville,2008
Grand Corps Malade,"C'était un soir sans histoire une fin de journée au destin sobre
21h sans espoir un mercredi d'octobre
Sur le macadam fatigué trottoir en pente rue des Dames
Très loin des drames agités c'est ma première soirée slam
Des êtres humains dans un café sont regroupés pour s'écouter
Ils prennent la parole un par un et mes oreilles sont envoûtées
Des humains à égalité chacun est libre de se lancer
Le principe est très simple encore fallait-il y penser
Je suis d'abord rester passif mais j'ai tout de suite rêver
D'action

Je suis d'abord resté pensif pour comprendre cette révélation
J'ai pris une avalanche de rimes et une cascade de thèmes 
Si loin du star-system tu restes tard si t'aimes
Quelques instants après j'ai déterrer l'encrier
En créant sans prier
Pour hurler sans crier
Sans accroc sans vriller 
Dans la voix l'encre y est 
Pour recevoir sans briller 
Et donner sans trier

Le slam a giflé mon esprit puis libère les passions
Secouant mon envie créative restée en hibernation
À la recherche des ces ambiances dans tout Paris je vais zoner
C'est décidé ma voix est libre et son timbre va raisonner
La poésie dans les bars a rendez-vous avec la vie
Je l'ai vu et tu le vis
Je l'avoue je l'ai suivi
Elle prend forme elle grandit
Elle rayonne et elle s'entend 

Elle t'enlace et une fois qu'elle te tient elle prend son temps
La poésie dans les bars ne sort que dans nos voix
Le concept même de ces soirées est un poème qui s'entrevoit
La poésie se cache partout, sur le comptoir dans ton demi
Elle déborde sur le trottoir et se propage l'épidémie
Moi j'oublierai jamais l'année où j'ai choppé le virus
Quand tu trébuches sur un hasard et que tu tombes sur un bonus
Ces soirées où l'on se livre, ces moments où l'on se lève
Des heures à user nos salives, croquer les mots jusqu'à la sève
J'oublierai pas ces instants rares où la nuit sert de terrain 
À la recherche de l'éphémère moitié inquiet moitié serein
J'sais pas si le bonheur se touche mais on l'a peut être frôlé deux-trois fois

Dans cette atmosphère un peu louche se reflétant dans nos voix
J'oublierai pas ces cœurs ouverts de toute provenance et de tout âge
Unis dans l'envie de découvrir dans l'écoute et le partage
Ceux qui étaient là ne changeraient rien même si tout était à refaire
Et puis en plus un texte dit c'était quand même un verre offert
Ces soirées sont toujours là mais le mieux c'est quand tu fais connaissance
Rien ne vaut le charme de l'inconnu la découverte et l'innocence

Cette nostalgie me rappelle souvent que j'ai aussi serré des mains
Des rencontres qui font que t'aimerais qu'hier déteigne sur demain
J'suis toujours plein de motivation et je récidive sans façon
Recherchant cette sensation qui vaut bien sept cent passions
De cette époque non révolue j'ai reçu un héritage viral
Une manie qui ne me quitte plus c'est vrai, j'écris à l'oral
C'était un soir sans histoire une fin de journée au destin sobre
21h sans espoir un mercredi d'octobre
J'ai entendu des voix qui touchent comme des chorales dans mon moral
Depuis j'ai de l'encre plein la bouche, depuis j'écris à l'oral",J'Écris à l'Oral,2008
Grand Corps Malade,"S’il y a bien une idée qui rassemble, une pensée qu’est pas toute neuve 
C’est que quel que soit ton parcours, tu rencontres de belles épreuves
La vie c’est Mister Hyde, pas seulement Docteur Jekyll 
J’ai vu le film depuis longtemps, la vie n’est pas un long fleuve tranquille

T’as qu’à voir les réactions d’un nouveau-né à l’hôpital 
S’il chiale si fort, c’est qu’il comprend que souvent la vie va lui faire mal 
Y’a des rires, y’a des pleurs, y’a des bas, y’a des hauts 
Y’a des soleils et des orages et je te parle pas que de météo

On vit dans un labyrinthe et y’a des pièges à chaque virage 
À nous de les esquiver et de pas calculer les mirages
Mais le destin est un farceur, on peut tomber à chaque instant 
Pour l’affronter, faut du cœur et un mental de résistant

J’ai des cicatrices plein la peau et quelques-unes dans mes souvenirs 
Y’a des rescapés partout, j’suis qu'un exemple, ça va sans dire
Ça doit se sentir, faut pas se mentir, la vie c’est aussi la guérison 
Après la foudre, prend toi en main et redessine ton horizon

Y’a des tempêtes sans visages où on doit se battre contre le pire 
Personne n’y échappe, Rouda c’est pas toi qui vas me contredire
C’est l’ultime épreuve où tu affrontes la pire souffrance morale 
Quand la peine rejoint l’impuissance pour la plus triste des chorales

J’ai vu des drames à cœurs ouverts, j’ai vu des gens qui s’accrochent 
Ce qui est bien avec le drame, c’est que tu le partage avec tes proches
Pour les miens il est peut être l’heure de m’arrêter un court instant 
Pour les remercier d’avoir du cœur et un mental de résistant

La vie est aussi perverse, ce que tu désires elle l’a caché 
Elle te le donnera pas tout cuit, va falloir le chercher
Du coup ce qu’on a, on le mérite, au hasard on rien piqué au hasard 
Et si t’as pas compris, va voir mes potes ils vont t’expliquer

Jacky, tu m’as dit que l’ascenseur social était bloqué 
Toi t’es allé chez Otis et le réparateur tu l’as braqué
Sans craquer, sans rémissions, t’as affronté de vraies missions 
Tu m’as montré qu’avoir du mental, c’est aussi avoir de l’ambition

Y’a pas de chemin facile, Brahim t’as rien demandé à personne 
T’as tout construit de tes mains et y’a pas que moi que tu impressionnes
Toi Sami t’es notre moteur parce que tu sais depuis longtemps
Que pour ça chémar il faut du cœur et un mental de résistant

Je crois qu’on a tous une bonne étoile sauf que des fois elle est bien planquée 
Certaines même plus que d’autres, il faut aller les débusquer
Parfois ça prend du temps quand tu fais trois fois le tour du ciel 
Mais si tu cherches c’est que tu avances, à mon avis c’est l’essentiel

Je fais partie de ceux qui pensent qu’y a pas de barrière infranchissable
Il faut y croire un peu, y’a bien des fleurs qui poussent dans le sable
Et c’est quand tu te bats qu’il y a des belles victoires que tu peux arracher
Comme se relever avec une moelle épinière en papier mâché

Je n’apprends rien à personne, tu es vivant tu sais ce que c’es
Vivre c’est accepter la douleur, les échecs et les décès
Mais c’est aussi plein de bonheur, on va le trouver en insistant 
Et pour ça, faut du cœur et un mental de résistant",Mental,2008

Quotidien nuageux, avec risque d’orage 
Une époque embrumée à forte perturbation 
Situations trop inégales, impliquant des dommages 

Le temps est très mauvais sur les trois quarts sud de la planète 
Si vous prenez la vie, naissez plutôt au Nord 
Car les écarts se creusent, la carte est claire et nette 
C’est un climat dangereux et il nous déshonore 

Un vent frais de changement pourrait renouveler l’air 
Éviter les tempêtes sur l’avenir des enfants 
Dégager les consciences d’un brouillard ordinaire 
Et remettre le baromètre sur un futur plus confiant 

Sous cette pluie de contrastes nous ne sommes les otages 
Que d’un silence cruel qui nous rend solitaires 
Nous aurons le même soleil à force de partage 
Et dès lors qu’il réchauffe nos instincts solidaires 

Depuis l’aube les hommes ont trouvé d’innombrables réponses 
Mais de toute évidence, pas toujours aux bonnes questions 
Quand progrès et dérive s’accordent et nous enfoncent 
Dans un chacun pour soi stoppant notre ascension 

Et puisque le monde est devenu un village 
On ne peut plus ignorer nos voisins, il est l’heure 
De créer un dialogue et de prendre un virage 
Où on tissera des liens qui prouveront nos valeurs

Ville du 93 où j'ai grandi et où j'suis né
Mon école elle est mignonne même si les murs sont pas tous neufs
Dans chaque salle y a plein de bruit moi dans ma classe on est 29

Y a pas beaucoup d'élèves modèles et puis on est un peu dissipés
J'crois qu'nous sommes ce qu'on appelle des élèves en difficulté
Moi en maths j'suis pas terrible mais c'est pas pire qu'en dictée
C'que je préfère c'est seize heures, j'retrouve les grands dans mon quartier

Pourtant ma maîtresse j'l'aime bien elle peut être dure mais elle est patiente
Et si jamais je comprends rien elle me réexplique, elle est pas chiante
Elle a toujours plein d'idées et de projets pour les sorties
Mais on a que deux cars par an qui sont prêtés par la mairie

Je crois que mon école elle est pauvre, on n'a pas de salle informatique
On n'a que la cour et le préau pour faire de la gymnastique
À la télé j'ai vu que des classes faisaient du golf en EPS
Nous on a que des tapis et des cerceaux et la détresse de nos maîtresses

Alors si tout s'joue à l'école, il est temps d'entendre le SOS

Ne laissons pas nos rois devenir fou dans des défaites spectaculaires

L'enseignement en France va mal et personne peut nier la vérité
Les zones d'éducation prioritaires ne sont pas des priorités
Les classes sont surchargées pas comme la paye des profs minés
Et on supprime des effectifs dans des écoles déjà en apnées

Au contraire faut rajouter des profs et des autres métiers qui prennent la relève
Dans des quartiers les plus en galère, créer des classes de 15 élèves
Ajouter des postes d'assistants ou d'auxiliaires qui aident aux devoirs
Qui connaissent les parents et accompagnent les enfants les plus en retard

L'enseignement en France va mal, l'état ne met pas assez d'argent
Quelques réformes à deux balles pour ne pas voir le plus urgent
Un établissement scolaire sans vrais moyens est impuissant
Comment peut on faire des économies sur l'avenir de nos enfants

L'enseignement en France va mal car il rend pas les gens égaux
Les plus fragiles tirent l'alarme mais on étouffe leur écho
L'école publique va mal car elle a la tête sous l'eau
Y a pas d'éducation nationale, y a que des moyens de survies locaux

Alors continuons de dire aux p'tits frères que l'école est la solution
Et donnons leur les bons outils pour leur avenir car attention
La réussite scolaire dans certaines zones pourrait rester un mystère
Et l'égalité des chances un concept de ministère

Est-ce que c'est l'expérience que nous ont enseigné nos darons?
Mais ce qu'on a tous compris c'est que la vie repose toujours
Sur l'enchaînement des opposés, après chaque nuit il va faire jour

Partant de cette évidence ou d'une volontaire naïveté
On sait qu'après chaque inquiétude viendra l'instant de sérénité
Comme si à l'échelle d'une vie les choses devaient s'équilibrer
Après l'orage les éclaircies, aucun ciel ne reste encombré

Alors on s'est imprégné de cette capacité d'adaptation

Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma' is good looking
So hush little baby, don't you cry

J'écris des textes sur c'que j'vois 
Alors assis dans un café 
J'regarde la vie autour de moi 
Derrière la vitre il fait bien jour 
Et y a du vent dans les arbres 
J'regarde le speed auprès des tours 
Et mes toasts au sirop d'érable 

J'me suis levé bien avant sept heures
C'est un exploit temporaire 
Habituellement ça m'ferait trop peur 
Mais j'suis en décalage horaire 
J'apprécie mon nouveau réel 
J'ai fait voyager mon moral 
Je sens qu'la journée sera belle 
Me revoici à Montréal 

On m'a dit qu'ici l'hiver est dur 
Alors j'suis venu au printemps 

Six mois dans l'froid c'est la torture 
Si j'peux éviter, j'aime autant 
Mais ce matin l'ciel est tout bleu 
Et j'sens qu'mon cœur est tout blanc 
J'vais connaître la ville un peu mieux 
Je veux voir Montréal en grand 

J'ai plutôt un bon à priori 
Parce que les gens sont accueillants 
Y a plus de sourires qu'à Paris 
Et puis surtout y a leur accent 
Mis à part quelques mots désuets 
Ils parlent le même langage que nous 
Mais pour l'accent j'sais leur secret 
Ils ont trop d'souplesse dans les joues 

Niveau architecture, Montréal c'est un peu n'importe quoi 
Y a du vieux, du neuf, des clochets, des gratte-ciels qui s'côtoient 
Mais j'aime cette incohérence et l'influence de tous ces styles 
J'me sens bien dans ces différences, j'suis un enfant de toutes les villes 
Y a plein d'buildings sévères, y a des grosses voitures qui klaxonnent 
Et des taxis un peu partout, c'est l'influence anglo-saxonne 

Y a des vitraux dans les églises et des pavés dans les ruelles 
Quelques traces indélébiles de l'influence européenne 
Y a des grands centres commerciaux, et des rues droites qui forment des blocs 
Pas de doute là-dessus, Montréal est la p'tite sœur de New York 
Y a des p'tits restos en terrasse, un quartier latin et des crêperies 
Pas de doute là-dedans, Montréal est la cousine de Paris 

Dans les lumières d'l'après-midi, j'ai chillé sur Sainte-Catherine 
Et là j'ai magasiné, pas question d'faire du shopping 
Moi j'aime bien la rue Saint-Denis, c'est p'têt pas juste un hasard 
Et sur l'plateau des bobos j'ai pris l'soleil à la place des arts 
J'ai bien aimé l'vieux-port et ses fantômes industriels 
Et bizarrement le quartier des musées j'le visiterai la fois prochaine 
Je prétends pas connaître la ville, j'suis qu'un touriste plein d'amitié 
Mais j'aime ce lieu, son air, et ses visages du monde entier 

J'me suis arrêté pour observer la nuit tomber sur Montréal 
Et l'dernier clin d'œil du soleil changer les couleurs du Mont-Royal 
Les phares des voitures ont rempli les interminables avenues 
J'me suis senti serein, un peu chez moi, un peu perdu 
J'me suis réfugié dans un Starbucks afin d'finir de gratter 
Mon p'tit hommage sur cette ville où j'me suis senti adopté 
Sur ses habitants tellement ouverts qui parlent un drôle de patois 
Et qui m'ont offert leur écoute, à six-mille bornes de chez moi

Je reviendrai à Montréal voir les cousins Quebecois",A  Montréal,2010
Grand Corps Malade,"J'étais assis sur un banc, cinq minutes avec moi
Perdu dans mes pensées qui me parlaient sans voix
Dans un parc un peu désert, sous un ciel sans couleur
Un moment un peu d'air, dans une bulle sans humeur
Un vieil homme approcha fermant ainsi cette parenthèse
Il s'assit à côté de moi et me regarda l'air à l'aise
Avec un regard confiant il me dit cette phrase sans astuce
""Quel dommage que les gens ne se parlent pas plus""

Je ne vous connais pas, je m'assois près de vous
Si les gens se parlaient, les choses auraient un sens
Je vous parle et pourtant, je suis tout sauf un fou
C'est juste que je sais, privilège de l'âge
Que l'humain est moins sot, s'il est un peu curieux
Que l'humain est plus fort quand il croit au partage
Qu'il devient plus beau quand il ouvre les yeux

Qui a besoin des autres (qui a besoin des autres)

Il a sauté sur son cheval pour disparaître en un geste 
La porte du saloon claque encore, dehors, le vent fouette la poussière 
Lui, il galope vers son sort sans jamais r'garder derrière 
Est-ce qu'il cherche ou est-ce qu'il fuit? Est-il sûr ou incertain? 
Est-ce qu'il tente de rattraper ou d'échapper à son destin? 
À quoi ressemble son avenir? Une évidence ou un mystère? 
Il se fabrique un empire, il est fait d'ombre ou de lumière 

De l'ombre ou de la lumière 
Lequel des deux nous éclaire? 
Je marche vers le soleil 
Dans les couleurs de l'hiver 
De l'ombre ou de la lumière

C'est l'hiver en 2008, quelque part à Paris 
J'ai démarré la voiture pour échapper à ce temps pourri 
La porte du café tremble encore, dehors, la pluie fouette le bitume 
À chacun sa ruée vers l'or, j'accélère à travers la brume 
Puisque mon temps est limité, mes choix doivent être à la hauteur 
C'est une course contre la montre ou une course contre la peur 
C'est toujours la même chevauchée, on vise la lueur droit devant 
Même si cette quête est insensée, je cours pour me sentir vivant 

De l'ombre ou de la lumière
Lequel des deux nous éclaire? 
On marche vers le soleil 
Dans les couleurs de l'hiver 
De l'ombre ou de la lumière 
Depuis le temps que j'espère 
Retrouver dans un sourire 
Toutes les lois de l'univers 

On court à travers les siècles, mais c'est toujours la même chevauchée 
As-tu peur que la route s'achève? 
Mais cette course est insensée 
As-tu mis un nom sur toutes les lèvres, les lèvres? 

De l'ombre ou de la lumière

Grand Corps Malade,"Les 5 sens en éveil à l'approche de la Belle
Les capteurs s'émerveillent, répondant à l'appel
En un battement de cils, ils oscillent dociles
Vulnérables et puissants, équilibre fragile

Ça commence par la vue, rien n'est fait au hasard
Comme elle ôte ses vêtements, il l'habille du regard
Il la parcourt doucement, il n'a d'yeux que pour elle
Elle le tient et il y tient, comme à leurs prunelles

Elle n'a pas froid aux yeux, lui son œil est rincé
Comme il navigue à vue, il voudrait l'embrasser
Elle approche fébrile pour amorcer le jeu
Son visage et son corps, il en a plein les yeux

Elle est tout près de lui, imposant son aura
Comme un réflexe bestial se réveille l'odorat
Les pupilles se dilatent, les paupières sont fermées
Maintenant s'il la voit, c'est bien à vue de nez

Il respire son parfum et l'odeur de sa peau
Son arôme est si fin, c'est un nouveau cadeau
Et puisqu'il a du flair, elle va lui en donner
Il adore qu'elle le mène, par le bout du nez

Leurs bouches se rejoignent, le baiser le plus doux
Ses lèvres et puis sa langue, il aime déjà leur goût
Comme elle goûte à son charme, ils iront jusqu'au bout
C'est une femme de classe et un homme de goût

On dépasse la tendresse, maintenant le temps presse
Les pulsions apparaissent au départ des caresses
Car le sens qui prend place est celui du toucher
Ils étaient bien debout, ils seront mieux couchés

Il l'effleure de ses doigts, de ses mains, de sa bouche
Il sent bien que sa manière de la toucher la touche
Comme c'est un touche-à-tout, bien sûr il n'oublie rien
Elle n'est pas sainte-ni-touche, alors elle lui rend bien

Pour être consentant, il est bon qu'on s'entende
Cette écoute est mutuelle et les muscles se tendent
Oui le dernier des 5 sens est celui de l'ouïe
Il est proche de la transe quand elle susurre un ""oui""

Y a pas que les murs qu'ont des oreilles, les voisins vont comprendre
Quand le jour se fait attendre, l'amour se fait entendre
Car de bouche à oreille, j'entends dire aujourd'hui
Que l'éveil des 5 sens a de beaux jours devant lui",Les 5 sens,2013
Grand Corps Malade,"Acte 1, scène 1, unité de temps, unité de lieu
La pièce durera toute ta vie, l'histoire se déroule sous tes yeux.
Le rideau vient de s'ouvrir, toi tu soulèves les paupières.
Tes parents gèrent la mise en scène, ta pièce démarre et ils sont fiers
Ils te souhaitent pas une tragédie, ils préfèrent que l'histoire soit drôle.
C'est le théâtre de ta vie, c'est toi qui tient le premier rôle,
Tu regardes autour de toi les projecteurs, les premiers rangs,
Les gens qui te donnent la réplique et puis les autres, les figurants.

Tes parents ont écrit le début, mais tu vas vite réaliser
Que pour la suite, c'est entendu, tu vas devoir improviser,
Et puis trouver les bons dialogues, dans ce premier acte, tu es bavard,
Ce ne sera pas une pièce d'auteur, mais du théâtre de boulevard.
Alors ton histoire défile sous la rumeur des spectateurs,
Ton personnage perd l'innocence, t'essaies de rester à la hauteur,
Face aux premières piques de l'intrigue, face aux premiers mauvais accords,
Derrière les apparences bien lisses, tu découvres l'enfer du décor.

Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
Le scénar' est en friche, modifie-le, tu t'en fiches
Pour jouer les plus belles scènes et à l'heure de saluer le public,
Que tu aies le privilège d'avoir deux ou trois bonnes critiques
Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
L'histoire peut être riche, faut pas que tu traînes, faut pas que tu triches
Pour t'offrir de l'ivresse, du vertige, de l'émotion,
Et qu'à la fin les gens se lèvent pour ta dernière ovation.

Alors de cour à jardin, maintenant tu fais les cent pas,
Tu côtoies les bons comédiens, et puis y a ceux que tu sens pas.
On flirte avec le vaudeville avec toutes ces portes qui claquent,
Tu vois moins tes parents, ingratitude du deuxième acte.
Tu l'as compris sur les planches, c'est la cour de création,
Dans toutes les situations, tu vas faire preuve d'adaptation,
Dans un monde où le prévisible perd souvent le contrôle,
Le bon comédien est celui qui sait jouer tous les rôles

Et c'est là qu'intervient celle qui donne du sens à ta pièce,
Sous les feux de la rampe, ta prétendante met tes attentes en liesse,
Tout prend de l'importance, c'est ce que ton monologue indique
Fini le théâtre de boulevard, tu tiens ta tragédie antique.
Si tout va bien, l'amour donnera de nouveaux petits acteurs,
Qui à leur tour, joueront leur pièce devant la foule des spectateurs.
Tu mettras en scène leurs débuts, t'as compris les règles du pacte,
Avant de retrouver l'énergie de t'atteler à ton troisième acte.
Du public, on voit tes doutes, on voit tes gouttes, on voit la sueur,
Tes déboires, tes trous de mémoire, tes espoirs et tes lueurs
Le second rôle apprécie, c'est respectable et vibrant,
Les spectateurs vibrent aussi, c'est du spectacle vivant.

Pour t'offrir de l'ivresse, du vertige, de l'émotion,
Et qu'à la fin les gens se lèvent pour ta dernière ovation.

A quelques exceptions près, toutes les pièces se ressemblent un peu,
Ça tourne autour de sentiments, tu sens, tu mens, tu vis, tu veux,
Y a que le décor et les costumes qui sont amenés à changer,
Ça dépend des moyens de la prod', on a pas tous les mêmes budgets.
Moi j'ai grandi au cœur d'un beau théâtre occidental,
Loin des troupes du tiers-monde et des acteurs qui ont la dalle,
J'aime le théâtre de ces pays où la scène est à même le ciel,
Où les intrigues se resserrent souvent autour des valeurs essentielles.

A quelques exceptions près, toutes les pièces se ressemblent un peu,
Y a les grandes scènes de comédies et les bouts de drames contagieux,
Et puis y a tous ces imprévus, ces fous rires, ces dérapages,
Moi je n'aime ce théâtre que quand l'intrigue sort de la page.
Sois patient, reste en coulisse quand résonnent les coups de tonnerre,
Et quand la scène est compliquée, appuie-toi sur tes partenaires.
Ils te seront indispensables pour atteindre tes objectifs,
N'oublie jamais cet adjectif, le théâtre est un art collectif.
A toi d'observer dans l'ombre quand on t'attend dans la lumière
A toi de prendre le devant de la scène quand le scénario te prévoit derrière
Écorche un peu ce qui est écrit, la vie aura un autre parfum
Ta pièce aura une plus belle fin, écoute une dernière fois ce refrain

Il tient la main de sa copine pour défier l'hiver
La nuit part pour être belle
Mais elle se transforme vite en triste fait divers
Ils se croient seuls au monde dans les ruelles
Mais à l'évidence ils ne le sont plus
Deux Skinheads en manque d'embrouilles et d'adrénaline viennent leur tomber dessus
Une gifle pour éloigner la fille
Les mecs le rouent de coups à deux contre un
Le visage contre le bitume glacé voyant la mort arriver il se sent contraint
De sortir son arme car il est tout sauf un enfant de cœur
L'un des Skins meurt sur le coup et l'autre hurle encore sa douleur

Tout est allé si vite mais pourquoi ces mecs se sont retrouvés sur son chemin?
La douleur physique n'est rien quand il la compare à la peur du lendemain
Il s'est rendu au matin plaidant la légitime défense corporelle
Il est jugé en quelques mois en prends 10 ans de réclusion criminelle
Il pense souvent à eux, il rêve tout le temps à elle
Il a beau regarder très loin il ne voit pas le bout du tunnel
Il découvre le cauchemar, l'humiliation, les matelas crades,
Les pieds enchaînés lors des transferts, et les bagarres lors des promenades,
Et alors qu'il subit depuis plus d'un an le système carcéral,
Une terrible nouvelle vient ajouter sa voix à la triste chorale,
Il est porteur d'un étrange virus que le monde découvre craintif,
1985 Nouvelle sentence, il est séropositif
Aucun traitement n'existe, plus rien à perdre il se sent condamné à mort
Alors il va être le plus fou dans un monde où c'est la loi du plus fort
Il tombe dans tous les pièges là où la spirale de la violence se corse,
Et puisqu'on le traite comme un chien, alors il sera le chien le plus féroce
Il sort enfin au bout de huit ans, l'avenir aussi triste que son paquetage
Les poches vides mais le sang plein de rage alors il monte sur un braquage
Il se fait serrer un an plus tard et c'est le retour à la case cauchemar
A la case où tout est sombre et où la nuit dure des semaines isolé au mitard
Il ne pense plus à eux il ne rêve plus à elle
Il n'ose même plus regarder devant, il est trop loin le bout du tunnel
Ou alors ce bout du tunnel, il va falloir se le construire
Il sait que s'il ne tente rien, c'est dans ces murs qu'il va mourir

9 Octobre '94, date d'anniversaire de l'abolition de la peine de mort
Il réussit son évasion et abolit lui-même son triste sort
Quelques mois de cavale seulement avant de rejoindre les murs tout gris
Quelques mois de liberté agités avant de repeindre les murs d'oubli
Il est alors placé directement dans les quartiers de haute sécurité
A l'isolement pendant 5 ans, on lui dit que c'est tout ce qu'il a mérité
Quand il se regarde dans le miroir, il a peur de ce que le reflet lui montre
C'est vrai ça n'a jamais été un tendre mais la prison a fait de lui un monstre
Un malheur n'arrivant jamais seul, le sida se déclare, la maladie s'installe
Il meurt peu à peu sans assistance et dans l'indifférence la plus totale
1995 À deux doigts de quitter la prison pour le cimetière
La trithérapie fait son apparition et lui remet doucement les pieds sur terre
Poussé à nouveau vers la vie et essayant de voir derrière les barreaux de fer
Il se marie avec celle qu'il aime, ses sentiments réchauffent enfin l'atmosphère
Mais son jugement toujours en attente finit un sale jour par tomber
Pour évasion et braquage il prend 30 ans, le bout du tunnel s'est estompé
Pourtant il garde en lui l'espoir, il a tellement tutoyé la mort
Il se sent invincible c'est sûr il sait qu'un jour il retournera dehors
En 2000 il se met à écrire, sa nouvelle arme pour survivre face au système
Il gratte jour et nuit, ce n'est plus lui désormais mais c'est son stylo qui saigne
Il écrit son premier livre et tient en ligne le premier blog d'un prisonnier,
Ses œuvres transpercent les portes blindées et maintenant plus personne ne peut nier
Qu'il est vivant, qu'il existe, qu'il réinvente le mot avenir,
En 2008 naît sa fille et l'amour et la vie ne sont plus des souvenirs
Il a les mains sur ses stylos, fini le temps des mains en l'air
""Avant je m'évadais au pistolet,
Aujourd'hui je m'évade à l'épistolaire""
Il sort en janvier 2010 avec des projets et des repères
Après 25 ans passé dans un tunnel,
Laurent a rejoint la lumière.",Le Bout du tunnel,2013
Grand Corps Malade,"Eh Tonton, est-ce que t’as regardé dehors?
Sur l’avenir de nos enfants il pleut de plus en plus fort
Quand je pense à eux pourtant, j’aimerais chanter un autre thème
Mais je suis plus trop serein, je fais pas confiance au système
Ce système fait des enfants mais il les laisse sur le chemin
Et il oublie que s’il existe, c’est pour gérer des êtres humains
On avance tous tête baissée sans se soucier du plan final
Ce système entasse des gosses et il les regarde crever la dalle
Tonton on est du bon côté mais ce qu’on voit, on ne peut le nier
J’ai grandi au milieu de ceux que le système a oubliés
On vit sur le même sol mais les fins de mois n’ont pas le même parfum
Et chaque année monte un peu plus la rumeur des crève-la-faim
Le système a décidé qu’y avait pas de place pour tout le monde
Tonton, t’as entendu les cris dehors, c’est bien notre futur qui gronde
Le système s’est retourné contre l’homme, perdu dans ses ambitions
L’égalité est en travaux et y’a beaucoup trop de déviations

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment?
Dis-moi Tonton, on va faire comment?

Est-ce que les hommes ont voulu ça, est-ce qu’ils maîtrisent leur rôle
Ou est-ce que la machine s’est emballée et qu’on a perdu le contrôle
Est-ce qu’y a encore quelqu’un quelque part qui décide de quelque chose
Ou est-ce qu’on est tous pieds et poings liés en attendant que tout explose
Difficile de me rassurer Tonton, je te rappelle au passage
Que l’homme descend bel et bien du singe pas du sage
Et c’est bien l’homme qui regarde mourir la moitié de ses frères
Qui arrache les derniers arbres et qui pourrit l’atmosphère
Y’a de plus en plus de cases sombres et de pièges sur l’échiquier
L’avenir n’a plus beaucoup de sens dans ce monde de banquiers
C’est les marchés qui nous gouvernent, mais ces tous ces chiffres sont irréels
On est dirigé par des graphiques, c’est de la branlette à grande échelle

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment, tu peux me dire?
Comme il faut que tout soit rentable, on privatisera l’air qu’on respire
C’est une route sans issue, c’est ce qu’aujourd’hui, tout nous démontre
On va tout droit vers la défaite dans cette course contre la honte

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment?
Dis-moi Tonton, on va faire comment?

Entre le fromage et le dessert, tout là-haut dans leur dîner
Est-ce que les grands de ce monde ont entendu le cri des indignés
Dans le viseur de la souffrance, y’a de plus en plus de cibles
Pour l’avenir, pour les enfants, essayons de ne pas rester insensibles

Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne

Ni les yeux bleus ni les regards noirs

Mais ce qu’il y a devant, c’est si grand
Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
T’as bien le temps d’avoir le chagrin éternel
S’ils veulent pas le reconstruire le nouveau monde, on se mettra au boulot
Il faudra de l’utopie et du courage
Faudra remettre les pendules à l’heure, leur dire qu’on a pas le même tic tac,
Que nous, il est plutôt du côté du cœur
Fini le compte à rebours du vide, du rien dedans
Ma gueule d’amour, mon petit pote d’azur
Il est des jours où je ne peux rien faire pour toi
Les conneries je les ai faites, et c’est un chagrin qui s’efface pas
Faut pas manquer beaucoup pour plus être le héros, faut pas beaucoup
Je t’jure petit frère, faut freiner à temps
Va falloir chanter l’amour, encore plus fort
Y’aura des révolutions qu’on voudra pas, et d’autres qui prennent leur temps,
Pourtant c’est urgent
Où est la banque, il faut que je mette une bombe,
Une bombe désodorante,
Une bombe désodorante pour les mauvaises odeurs du fric qui déborde
Pas de place pour les gentils, les paumés de la vie
Chez ces gens-là, on aime pas, on compte

Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
P’tit frère, putain, on va le reconstruire ce monde
Pour ça, Tonton, faut lui tendre la main
Tonton, il peut rien faire si t’y crois pas
Alors faudra se regarder, se découvrir, jamais se quitter
On va rien lâcher
On va rester groupé
Y’a les frères, les cousines, les cousins, y'a les petits de la voisine,
Y’a les gamins perdus qui deviennent des caïds de rien,
Des allumés qui s’enflamment pour faire les malins
Y’a la mamie qui peut pas les aider, qu’a rien appris dans les livres,
Mais qui sait tout de la vie
À force de ne plus croire en rien, c’est la vie qui désespère
Faut aimer pour être aimé
Faut donner pour recevoir
Viens vers la lumière, p’tit frère
Ta vie c’est comme du gruyère, mais personne te le dis que tu as une belle âme

On va aimer regarder derrière pour rien oublier",Course contre la honte,2013

Traverser les années au milieu d’une mer de peur
Affrontant les tornades, la tête haute dans les orages
Tenant la barre, capitaine d’un bateau nommé courage
Ils font face à la pression et ils résistent comme personne
Comment vous dire et sur quel ton tous ces enfants m’impressionnent
J’ai vu leur force, leur dignité quand leur destin fronce les sourcils
Après tout ça, entendre se plaindre monsieur Tout-le-monde m’est difficile
Quand la croisière de l’enfance pleine de candeur loin des colères
Devient un voyage harassant au fond d’une cale dans une galère
On devrait juste avoir le droit de rester enfant dans le fond des yeux
Mais on est vite moins jeune dès que le temps est pluvieux

Alors j'ai croisé le show-biz, j'ai vu le royaume des egos
Qui pourra faire le plus d'entrées, qui provoquera le plus d'échos?
J'ne cracherai pas dans la soupe, là où je suis je me sens bien
Mais pour garder mon équilibre je n'oublierai pas d'où je viens
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre que je garde un peu de hors-piste
Car j'aime aussi la vie d'humain quand s'interrompt la vie d'artiste
Entre la lumière de la lune et celle des spots, maintenant je sais
Que j'ai ma place à l'Olympia, mais aussi dans les M.J.C.
Je prends du recule, je prends des gants quand j'vois le strass et les paillettes
Les gentils se sentent importants, moi ils me stressent, ils sont pas nets
J'ne cracherai pas dans la soupe, j'ai rencontré des gens très bien
Mais j'me reconnaîtrai toujours plus dans ceux qui viennent là d'où je viens
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre qu'on a joué dans des cathédrales
Mais juste après yeux dans les yeux avec un public carcéral
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre que tous mes sentiments se touchent
Quand je vois le public se lever, je pense à mon fils qui se couche

Si j'aime la nuit c'est grâce au jour et j'aime le jour grâce à la nuit
J'aime être tout seul grâce à la foule et grâce au silence j'aime le bruit
Besoin d'tout ça pour que ça vibre j'me sentir fort et avoir peur
Tout est une question d'équilibre, je crois en c'truc du fond du cœur
Si dans une vie ça part en vrille c'est qu'l'équilibre à vrillé
Pour le garder c'est capital de pas dormir sur ses lauriers
Alors je reste vigilant quitte à recréer du désordre
Entre le glacé et le brûlant j'aime la douceur, j'aime que ça morde
L'équilibre est dans la nature, j'invente rien ça va sans dire
Il faut d'la pluie et du soleil pour que la fleur puisse s'épanouir
Faut l'exception dans la règle pour que la vie ait plus de goût
Il faut d'la force et de l'adresse pour que l'enfant se mette debout
J'mets d'la lumière pour voir l'avenir mais parfois j'aime autant l'éteindre
Dans la vie on se fout de l'objectif c'qui compte c'est la route pour l'atteindre
Alors j'avance sur un fil parmi les chemins qui s'éparpillent
En équilibre mal habile, je suis un funambule à béquilles

Ou des émotions c’est pareil
Dans vos théâtres et vos enceintes
J’ai mis des mots comme une empreinte
J’ai mis des mots un peu partout
Redistribués au coup par coup
Je sais même plus où je les ai mis
J’ai mis des mots j’ai pas gémi
J’ai mis des mots mais jamais trop
Dans un métro dans un micro
J’ai mis des mots j’ai eu les crocs
Des mots nouveaux des mots rétros
J’ai mis des mots pour compenser
J’ai pas le destin qu’on pensait

J’ai mis des mots  que j’ai couvés
J’ai tenté de les faire groover
Sans entrave et rien à prouver
Sans en baver tout à trouver

La première fois en 2003
J’ai oublié les médisants
J’ai mis des mots c’est mes 10 ans
J’ai mis des mots j’ai des raisons
Coupable de combinaisons
Et je crée sans comparaison

Dans plein de pays j’ai mis des mots
Berlin Québec ou Bamako

J’ai mis des mots jusqu’à Beyrouth
J’ai mis des mots dans tous les sens

Des mots sympas ou en colère
Des mots bien droits ou en galère
J’ai mis des mots c’est dérisoire
Parfois tranchants c’est des rasoirs
Mais bien placés c’est opportun
J’ai mis des mots c’est important
J’ai trouvé de l’inspiration
Pour inspirer mes directions
Pour continuer sans crispation
Je reprends ma respiration

Grand Corps Malade,"Un certain soir d'incertitude,
Je suis allé voir une voyante.
Prêt pour l'arnaque et l'inquiétude,
Car la vision de l'avenir est payante.
C'est mon cœur qui frappe quand je sonne à la porte,
Je me sens tout gamin
Quand elle ouvre, me regarde, me sourit et m'escorte
Pour me lire les lignes de la main.

Elle prend son pied en prenant mes mains,
Ses mains tenant mes doigts sont balèzes.
Elle est adroite et j'ai deux mains gauches, ses mains tenant mon malaise.
Elle a la main forte, elle a la main ferme, elle a la main mise
Parfois où je sorte, je veux revenir demain, mes deux mains sont prises.
Sa main est agile, et ça m'indispose que sa main tripote,
Car sa main est curieuse, et sa main est fouineuse, ça m'insupporte.
Mais ça m'intéresse quand sa main se calme car sa main est belle
Oui sa main est douce et sa main est chaude et ça m'interpelle.

Elle prend ma main gauche pour me lire les lignes,
Moi j'ai un mauvais feeling,
Car elle veut être précise, mais moi je lui propose de rester dans les grande lignes.
Ses doigts glissent sur ma peau comme une piste de cœur ligne,
Elle vise la ligne de cœur,
C'est une ligne à haute tension, elle est en première ligne,
Une ligne à la hauteur.

Niveau cœur, pas besoin de savoir lire entre les lignes,
Elle voit que la ligne est occupée.
C'est une ligne droite magnifique, longiligne, rectiligne,
La ligne printemps été.
En revanche la voyance ne trouve pas ma ligne de chance, j'ai vraiment pas de pot.
On l'avait en ligne de mire, moi j'avais envie d'en rire, elle l'a ripé sur un bout de peau.
Mais en ligne de compte elle a retrouvé ma chance, c'est une vraie pilote de ligne.
La ligne de chance aime bien faire des feintes, elle est maligne ma ligne.

La dernière ligne droite, la meilleure, t'as décidé d'analyser ma ligne de vie.
Elle cherche la ligne d'arrivée, mais la voyante a souligné qu'apparemment ma ligne dévie.
Alors ma ligne de vie rage, ma ligne de vie perd, mais la voyante ne la voit pas bien.
Elle a un air inquiet car la ligne est coupée, alors moi j'entends plus rien

Je lui demande si elle est sûre, elle scrute les interlignes.
Ce moment est inhumain,
Du coup elle va se faire une petite ligne,
Moi j'ai perdu mon avenir quelque part au creux de ma main.
Ça met un bout de temps mais on a retrouvé ma vie,
Elle avait juste sauté une ligne.

Quand la séance fut finie j'ai décidé de prendre soin de moi,
Et de faire attention à ma ligne.
Avant de quitter la voyante on s'est serré la main,
On a mélangé nos lignes.
Une chose est sûre je reviendrais pas demain,
Elle s'est vraiment plantée sur toutes les lignes.

Depuis, ma ligne de conduite est de viser la ligne d'horizon,
Pour voir plus loin que le bout de mes lignes,
Fini de lire dans les mains, maintenant je préfère serrer le poing.

T'as toujours le même air, plutôt fier et sérieux
Quand tu donnes toi-même le ticket au monsieur
Et le manège démarre, en avant la musique
C'est tout con, ça tourne en rond et pourtant c'est magique
Quand tu passes devant moi, tu me fais un sourire

Tu me manques pendant 10 secondes, c'est normal à ce qui paraît
Je te vois t'amuser, je t'observe comme un fou

Je te regarde passer pour la huit millième fois
Je suis devant ce manège depuis des années
Toi t'as pris 20 centimètres, le soleil a tourné

De liberté, hm hm

A la radio, les sales nouvelles chantent leur refrain
Mais aujourd'hui personne cassera mon entrain
Bien trop zen et même que dans ma tête un peu larguée
Y a une basse de funk et un beat de reggae

Derrière la vitre y a ce bruit, la ville qui ronronne
Faut que je sorte et prendre un peu ce qu'on me donne
Derrière la vitre ça sent le printemps

Je salue les éboueurs et flics, cette blonde en tailleur
Son joli sourire tombe à pic sur ma bonne humeur

Ça vit, ça rit, ça gueule sur mon trottoir
Du Grec au Chinois de l'épicier au bar

Un odeur de mafé, les 5 sens en éveil

Des gentils aux féroces
Des bolosses aux colosses

Grand Corps Malade,"Je n'sais pas depuis combien de temps je suis assis sur ce banc
Une bonne heure ou vingt minutes, le spectacle est absorbant
J'observe les gens qui passent, moi je me sens à peine là
J'écoute le vent qui trace dans son murmure acapela
Rester assis sur un banc c'est tout un savoir faire
C'est maîtriser les mouvements qu'il faut savoir taire
C'est assumer et afficher son pouvoir de paresse
Le sentir comme une caresse, chasser les crampes qui apparaissent
Moi j'ai de bonnes capacités dans ma force d'inertie
Il faut savoir en profiter, pouvoir lui dire merci
Être assis sur un banc au beau milieu du décor
C'est être au cœur de la vie, mais surtout être en dehors
C'est de cette cachette ouverte que j'observe mon petit monde
Laissant agir à découvert la nonchalance qui m'inonde
Je n'sais pas depuis combien de temps je suis assis sur ce banc
Je regarde les gens pressés, et puis ceux qui font semblant
Face à cette scène de théâtre, je n'peux plus m'arrêter
Je savoure l'espèce humaine dans son immense variété
J'aime les vieux, les gros, les moches, les grandes gueules et les discrets
Les vénères, les beaux gosses, les précis et les distraits
Un enfant apparaît au loin, agitant un p'tit bâton
En plein combat féroce contre une bonne dizaine de dragons
Il se moque bien des regards dans son délire d'innocence
Et disparaît à toute allure, presque aussi vite que l'enfance
Une belle femme entre à présent dans mon champ de vision
De grands yeux clairs, un regard sûr, elle semble sourire sans raison
Je l'a regarde quand elle s'approche, elle marche avec délicatesse
Je l'a regarde quand elle s'éloigne pour admirer ses jolies tresses
Une autre revient des courses, elle est chargée comme une mule
Le visage fermé, le regard presque aussi triste que son pull
Elle porte tout le poids de la routine dans chacun de ses mouvements
À moins que ce soit l'poids des sacs, j'extrapole un peu surement
Mais regarder les gens passer c'est ne les connaître que vingt secondes
Il faut alors imaginer toute une histoire qui corresponde
Comme ces deux jeunes qui parlent en slave, surement des espions russes
Où peut-être juste deux étudiants en échange Erasmus
Alors j'arrête une minute de pousser mon imagination
Pour admirer le dernier style de la nouvelle génération
Des jeans slims et des coiffures comme dans les clips tard le soir
J'ai un peu d'mal à comprendre, j'crois que je suis en train de devenir ringard

Il va falloir que j'me relève, il va être l'heure de se retirer
Je jette un dernier regard panoramique pour m'inspirer
Y'a un vieux qui regarde devant et son p'tit fils qui regarde derrière
C'est peut-être un symbole d'un monde qui marche à l'envers
Je reprends ma route et mes projets, c'est qu'il y'a du pain sur la planche

Après la douche, c'est NTM qui fait bouger mes maxillaires

A la face d'un monde hanté par un futur sans avenir

On essayera de se souvenir pourquoi on a commencé ça
Faut trouver l'urgence d'écrire, le plus important c'est ça
Être soi même malgré tout, naïf, décidé, bavard
On absorbera les mots en trop sur un bout d'papier buvard
On essayera de se souvenir qu'on a fait ça dans calculer
On a noirci sans rougir tout ce qu'on trouvait d'immaculé
Comme un réflexe dérisoire, c'était bon quand j'y pense
Et on a rempli des pages comme tu t'es rempli la panse

Pour arroser encore la source qu'on n'laissera pas tarir

On entendra encore nos joies, on entendra encore les cris

Les premiers pas, les premières courses, les premiers genoux écorchés

Les premières nuits pointillées, les premiers vices de couche-tard
On a encore les Memory et les parties de dominos
Les jouets qui font trop d'musique et les matins trop matinaux
Les journées de taff' raccourcies, l'ultimatum de 16h30
Et les promenades au parc, tous les jours où ça leur tente
On continue de s'émerveiller devant un dessin d'cosmonaute
Ou un bonhomme pâte-à-modeler avec un bras plus grand que l'autre
On continue de vouloir filmer tous ces moments insensés
Qui ne reviennent plus jamais, dès lors qu'le film est lancé
On a eu les premiers hostos, les inquiétudes, les premières peurs
Les premières grosses engueulades et les punitions à contre cœur
Les premiers cadeaux débiles avec leur nom sur leur tasse
Les siestes d’un œil sur l’canapé en regardant Pocahontas

On attend sans impatience, les premiers devoirs à la maison
Les premiers stress de contrôle, les boules au ventre à l’horizon
Les premiers mots dans le carnet pour les tarés quand ils s’amusent
Les premières mauvaises notes, pour les carrés de l’hypoténuse
On redoute un peu quand même le cartable de 20 kilos
Cahiers à spirales, intercalaires, trousse qui déborde de stylos
Et puis il y'aura premier portable, les premières boums, premières soirées
Les premières peines de cœur, premier rencard un peu foiré
Ce sera un peu l’moment de toutes les grandes premières fois
Les premières cuites, les premières nuits qu’on ne nous racontera pas
On les regardera agir avec un pincement au cœur
Car de leur vie on deviendra de plus en plus spectateur
Il y'aura la première fois moins de 5 fautes au code de la route
Qui leur permettra de s’éloigner encore plus vite et puis sans doute
Suivra leur premier appart avec une Pocahontas bien élancée
Ils reviendront vider leur chambre, ça j’ose même pas y penser
Il nous restera ça je l’espère, ce sentiment essentiel
De les avoir bien préparé à cet immense bordel
Il nous restera ça j’en suis sur, cette indicible joie
De les voir courageux, bien épanouis dans leurs choix
Il nous restera une maison avec une ou deux chambres en trop
Retrouvant le statut de jeune couple en perdant celui de parents pro
Il nous restera à regarder devant en appréciant ce qu'il y'a derrière
Prendre pleins de photos de demain, pour compléter celles d'hier
Et puis les chambres en trop seront à nouveau amochées
Par la nouvelle génération des premiers jouets écorchés
Le cycle jouera son rôle implacable et fatidique
Et on retrouvera des jouets modernes qui feront toujours trop de musique
Au milieu des nouveaux cris on s'dira qu'on a réussi
À fabriquer ce manteau, qui nous protège la vie
Ce confort impalpable, ce tremplin, cette béquille
Ce miracle anodin, on a fait une famille

""Ce serait encore plus dur, encore plus humiliant""
Et puis comment elle aurait fait avec un bébé comme paquetage?
Est-ce qu'il aurait survécu après tout c'voyage?
Yadna a fui les bombes, la guerre dans son pays
Elle sait qu'elle avait peur mais ne sait plus de quels ennemis
Entre les tirs de son président, des rebelles, de l'occident
De Daesh et des Kurdes, elle ne sait plus d'où vient l'vent
Elle ne sait plus d'où vient la poudre qui a rasé son village
Elle ne sait plus qui tire les balles qui ont éteint tous ces visages
Elle sait juste que l'Homme est fou et qu'c'est là-bas, en Syrie
Que s'est formé petit à p'tit l'épicentre de sa folie

J'avais p't-être un peu d'monnaie mais j'suis pressé, faut qu'je bouge
J'me rappelle de son regard, j'ai croisé Yadna au feu rouge

Après trois mois d'périple dans toutes sortes d'embarcations
Elle a souvent cru qu'la mort serait la seule destination
Comme lors de cette nuit noire au milieu d'la mer Égée
Dépassée par les vagues sur un bateau bien trop léger
Entre les centres de rétention et les passeurs les plus cruels
Yadna a perdu d'vue tous ceux qui avaient fui avec elle
Elle s'est retrouvée seule avec la peur, le ventre vide
Et des inconnus aussi perdus qu'elle comme seuls guides
Marchant pendant des semaines puis payant à des vautours
Le droit d'se cacher à l'arrière des camions sans voir le jour
Après ces mois d'enfer, elle passe ses nuits sur un carton
Son Eldorado se situe Porte de la Chapelle, sous un pont

J'me rappelle de son regard, j'ai croisé Yadna au feu rouge

Dans ses nuits, les cauchemars d'expulsion sont réguliers
Elle attend d'obtenir le statut d'réfugiée
Elle mendie au feu rouge avec la détresse comme baîllon
Elle se renseigne sur ses droits, petite princesse en rayon
Elle imagine parfois sa vie d'étudiante dans son pays
Si la justice avait des yeux, si la paix régnait en Syrie
Elle sourit même parfois, quand elle trouve la force d'y penser
Elle rêve en syrien mais, là, elle pleure en français
J'aperçois Yadna rapidement lorsque l'feu passe au vert
J'ai un p'tit pincement au cœur, mais j'suis en retard et j'accélère
Les plus grands drames sont sous nos yeux mais on est pressé, faut qu'on bouge
Y a des humains derrière les regards, j'ai croisé Yadna au feu rouge",Au feu rouge,2017

Avec une enclume sur le dos, les pieds liés et le vent de face 
C’est déjà plus dur d’aimer la vie, de faire des sourires dans la glace 
On a perdu la première manche mais le même joueur rejoue

Y’avait surement plusieurs options mais finalement on a opté 
Pour accepter cette position, trouver un espoir adapté 
Alors on va relever les yeux, quand nos regrets prendront la fuite 
On se fixera des objectifs à mobilité réduite 
Là bas au bout des couloirs, il y aura de la lumière à capter 
On va tenter d’aller la voir avec un espoir adapté

C’est retrouver le gout de la sueur entre deux barres parallèles 
Un espoir adapté, c’est de l’espoir bousculé 
Parce qu’on est dos au mur, y’a plus de place pour reculer 
Comme un instinct de survie on pense encore à avancer 
À la fin de quelque chose il y a bien un truc à commencer 
Après avoir nagé au cœur des points d’interrogations 
On va sortir de la torpeur certains diront reconversion 
Là bas au bout des couloirs, y’aura de la lumière à capter 
On va tenter d’aller la voir avec un espoir adapté 

I’ve been trying to let it go 
Been trying to free my soul 
But all the friends that I have lost 
And all the scars that I have left 
My body, embodies all my sorrows 
My bones mirror my own morals 
Now I don’t need nothing more than to feel my heart pounding 
I’ll hold on to this second chance I’ll breathe it 

Retrouver un espoir sans oublier ceux qui saignent 
Car dans cette quête on est pas tous logés à la même enseigne 
Moi j'ai eu ma deuxième chance et même si je peux la rendre belle 
Je pense souvent à la tristesse du dernier sourire de noël 
Un espoir adapté c’est faire le deuil de tous les autres 
Sourire encore ne serai-ce qu’en hommage à tous les nôtres 
Ceux qui étaient là, qui m’ont porté au propre comme au figuré 
Ceux qui ont adapté leurs vies pour rendre la mienne moins compliquée 

Can you hear me? I am awake 
Can you see all the fights that happen through my eyes 
Don’t lie I reach the light and hope will guide

Ça arrive d'un seul coup, puis ça revient assez régulièrement

Et, du coup, c'est très bizarre, tout s'mélange un peu, c'est
J'sais pas comment dire, j'entends comme des

Par exemple, j'entends Brassens sur un vinyle, ""Chanson pour l'auvergnat""
J'entends l'accent d'ma grand-mère quand elle chantait ""Ramona""
J'entends les voix d'mes parents, de celles qui rassurent
J'entends ma plume sur un papier, et les premières ratures
J'entends Maguy à la télé qui sonne la fin du week-end
J'entends ma mère, pour me bercer, qui vient chanter ""Göttingen""
J'entends la sérénité, la quiétude et l'harmonie
J'entends mon premier texte qui parle de famille unie
J'entends ma sœur dans sa chambre qui écoutait les Cure
J'entends nos cris d'enfants quand on sortait dans la cour
J'entends la sonnerie du collège qui annonce la fin d'l'heure
J'entends toujours beaucoup plus de fous rires que de pleurs
J'entends les portes du métro et la cohue d'la ligne treize
J'entends l'accent des clandos qui vendent des frites-merguez
J'entends les piliers d'bars qui philosophent et théorisent
J'entends le clocher d'la mairie qui sonne le temps des cerises

J'entends les break-beats à l'ancienne et les premiers phrasés hip-hop
J'entends les bombes de peinture, j'voulais taguer avec mes potes
Mais j'entends leurs ricanements devant mes tags pathétiques
J'suis retourné faire du sport, j'avais un art plus athlétique
J'entends des terrains en parquet, des ballons qui rebondissent
Des clameurs en paquets et des semelles qui crissent
J'entends siffler les arbitres et chanter dans les vestiaires
J'entends gueuler l'entraîneur, comme si le match était hier
J'entends les vannes les plus folles sur les playgrounds de Marville
Les champions d'France de Chambrette habitaient tous dans ma ville
Sur ces terrains en bitume, j'ai usé tellement d'semelles
J'pouvais jouer au clair de lune et, ça, sept jours par semaine
J'entends le bel accent corse chaque été, loin d'la grisaille
J'entends des chants polyphoniques au lever du jour à Morosaglia
J'entends trinquer les Moresques et tous ces liens qui se soudent

Maison près des cités, fout le bazar depuis le CP 
Des modèles à la maison et des exemples dans la rue 
Sur trois ou quatre horizons j'ai pu aiguiser ma vue 
Gentil fils bien élevé et p'tite caille-ra morve au nez 
Adolescent bien casse-couille et sportif touche à tout 
Tennisman et sprinteur, basketteur bien physique 
Prof de sport, entraîneur, bientôt tétraplégique 
Commercial dans un bureau loin de leurs us et coutumes 
Loin de leur rentabilité, d'leur bonus et costumes 
Banlieusard dans l'âme et même apprenti bobo 
Amoureux de ma femme et bien sûr papa gâteau 

Quelques bons choix pour aller haut 
Et des ratés des aléas 
Je suis perdant de cette vie-ci 
Mais pour celle là j’suis lauréat

Entre coups de cœur et coups de cul, beau hasard et belles envies 
On a fait ce qu’on a pu, on a tous eu mille vies 
Tel un Rubik's Cube la vie est pleine de facettes 
J'ai pisté les bonnes couleurs, j'ai grillé certaines cachettes 
J'ai pas cherché les problèmes mais parfois ils m'ont trouvé 
Pour l'esprit d'adaptation, j'ai plus rien à prouver 
J'accumule les existences et j'aime vivre à l'excès 
Mais qui a plusieurs vies a bien plusieurs décès 
Faire le deuil de certains souffles pour retrouver la joie 
Accepter d'être mort déjà une ou deux fois 
Pour ma dernière vie en date j'ai trouvé une belle piste 
J'ai écrit sur tous les fronts, certains m’appellent l'artiste 
J'ai plusieurs cordes à mon stylo et je veux en faire bon usage 
Dans cette vie là et celle d'après je ne serai pas plus sage 

Quelques bons choix pour aller haut 
Et des ratés des aléas 
Je suis perdant de cette vie-ci

Grand Corps Malade,"Mon premier c'est du bitume c'est de la matière désolée
C’est des fenêtres dans des cubes face à un horizon morcelé 
Et puis c'est des couloirs sans courbe entre deux falaises de béton
Tant de construction humaine et si peu de nature qui lui répond 
Mon deuxième c'est des gens qui vivent très proches les uns des autres 
Et ne se regardent pas forcément même quand ils habitent côte à côte 
Mais quand parfois ils osent se parler dans une impulsion citoyenne 
Ça rend le décor plus doré et puis ça ouvre sur mon troisième 
Mon troisième c'est du mélange, des rencontres et du partages 
Ça crée une alchimie étrange qui nous fait grandir à chaque âge 
Y a des sourires dans toutes les langues et des différences qui s'effacent 
J’ai vu de belles vies apaisées mais j'ai vu aussi les vides d’en face 

Mon tout c’est la grande ville, je me promène dans ses charades 
Je me trompe parfois de sens et dans chaque erreur je me balade 
Je l'ai choisie depuis longtemps comme le meilleur terrain de jeu
Pour lui parler parfois j'avoue j'ai tenté de m’y perdre un peu 
Mon tout c’est la grande ville elle m'a saisi depuis l'enfance 
Je la connais trop bien je la critique et je l'encense 
Je la tutoie depuis longtemps même si jamais elle ne se dévoile 

J'ai tenté de l'apprivoiser c'est elle qui m'a pris dans sa toile 
Elle m'a nourri, elle m'a formé, elle m'a offert de son ivresse 
Elle a failli me voir tomber, me reprendre de justesse 
Et quand sa nuit m'offrait l'asphalte comme seul et unique horizon 
Elle s'est révélée comme la préface de toutes mes inspirations 
Et aujourd'hui encore quand je rentre seul et très tard 
Que la grande ville s'est habillée de son gros blouson de pluie noire 
J'aime bien qu'elle me retienne, elle me regarde dans les yeux
Elle sait que je lui cède et je retourne m’y perdre un peu 

Mon premier c'est une clameur sougacente, permanente 
Un murmure familier comme une rumeur rassurante 
C'est un tourbillon de voix et de reflet de lumières 
C'est du mouvement, de la musique, des rires et plaisirs populaires 
Mon deuxième c'est le silence et le chagrin des ruelles mortes 
C'est de la tristesse derrière les murs et de l'isolement derrière les portes 
C'est la misère à ciel ouvert et la détresse en libre accès 
Face aux odeurs de pourriture et des déchets de nos excès 
Mon troisième est une terre d'expérience, un laboratoire 
Pour les progrès et les dangers que le futur va faire valoir 
C'est le règne des contrastes qui fait que notre société tremble 
Qui nous contraint à vivre seul, qui nous enseigne à vivre ensemble 

Mon tout c’est la grande ville je me promène dans ses charades 
Je me trompe parfois de sens et dans chaque erreur je me balade 
Je l'ai choisie depuis longtemps comme le meilleur terrain de jeu
Pour lui parler parfois j'avoue j'ai tenté de m’y perdre un peu 
Mon tout c’est la grande ville elle m'a saisi par les cinq sens 
En me donnant ses codes, elle m’a volé mon innocence 
Mais elle m'a éveillé, réveillé, révélé en m’abritant 
Je reste émerveillée et égayé par elle et tous ses habitants 
Elle m'a appris, elle m'a conquis, elle m'a offert de sa folie 
Je sais qu'elle n'est pas tout le temps belle, je la trouve tellement jolie 
Et quand j'ai traversé ses jours et ses nuits sans transition 
Elle s'est révélée comme la préface de toutes mes inspirations 
Et aujourd'hui encore quand je rentre seul et très tard 
Que la grande ville s'est habillée de son gros blouson de pluie noire 
J'aime bien qu'elle me retienne, elle me regarde dans les yeux
Elle sait que je lui cède et je retourne m’y perdre un peu 

À ton tour de la grande ville tu vas découvrir les charades 
Tu vas te laisser surprendre sans vraiment chercher de parade 
Tu vas l'aimer, la détester, et comme je connais bien ce jeu 
Je vais flipper quand tu choisiras de t’y perdre un peu",Charades,

Parce qu'on est libres quand on est forts et plus forts quand nos liens se soudent 
Qu'une mauvaise passe devient alors moins profonde que le creux du coude 
Parce que tous les nuages du monde n'empêchent pas les pleines lunes 
Et que chaque fois qu’elles brillent, c’est nos débuts qui se rallument 
Parce que tu sais ce que j'aime, parce que je sais ce que tu veux 
Et que c'est quand même une première fois dès qu'on est seuls tous les deux 

Parce que 120 mois plus tard, je viens encore juste de te rencontrer 
Parce que tu es mon plan A et que tu seras aussi mon plan B 

Après dix ans d'un beau voyage où je me rappelle de chaque seconde

Grand Corps Malade,"Le corps humain est un royaume où chaque organe veut être le roi
Il y a la tête, le cœur, les couilles, ça, vous l'savez déjà
Mais les autres parties du corps ont aussi leur mot à dire
Chacun veut prendre le pouvoir, et le pire est à venir
Il y a, bien sûr, la bouche qui a souvent une grande gueule
Elle pense être la plus farouche mais s'met souvent l'doigt dans l'œil
Elle a la langue bien pendue pour jouer les chefs du corps humain
Elle montre les dents, c'est connu, mais n'a pas l'cœur sur la main
Seulement, la main n'a pas forcément l'monopole du cœur
Elle aime bien serrer l'poing, elle aime jouer les terreurs
Elle peut même faire un doigt, elle ne fait rien à moitié
La main ne prend pas d'gant et nous prend vite à contre-pied
Le pied n'a pas d'poil dans la main mais manque d'ambition
Au pied levé, j'dirais, comme ça, que le pied n'a pas l'bras long
Les bras, eux, font des grands gestes pour se donner l'beau rôle
Ils tirent un peu la couverture mais gardent la tête sur les épaules

On peut être timide ou on peut parler fort
D't'façon, ce qui décide, c'est le langage du corps
On peut avoir l'esprit vide ou un cerveau comme un trésor

Quand la bouche en fait trop, la main veut marquer l'coup
Pour pas prendre sa gifle, la bouche prend ses jambes à son cou
La bouche n'a rien dans l'ventre, elle préfère tourner l'dos
Et la main sait jouer des coudes, la tête lui tire son chapeau
Mais l’œil n'est pas d'accord, il lui fait les gros yeux
Ils sont pas plus gros qu'le ventre, mais l’œil sait c'qu'il veut
Car l'œil a la dent dure, le corps le sait, tout l'monde le voit
À part, peut-être, la main qui pourrait bien s'en mordre les doigts
Et, la jambe, dans tout ça, eh bien, elle s'en bat les reins
Elle est droit dans sa botte et continue son chemin
Personne ne lui arrive à la cheville quand il s'agit d'avancer
Même avec son talon d’Achille, elle trouve chaussure à son pied
Les pieds travaillent main dans la main et continuent leur course
Jamais les doigts en éventail, ils s'tournent rarement les pouces
Ça leur fait une belle jambe, toutes ces querelles sans hauteur
Les pieds se foutent bien d'tout ça, loin des yeux, loin du cœur

On peut être timide ou on peut parler fort

Mais les jours s'enchaînent avec le doute comme emblème

Et là tu vois ce que va être ton prochain jeu 
Depuis que tu es là évidemment tout s'accélère 
D'ailleurs souvent pour “ce matin” tu dis “hier” 
Tu es entré dans la famille sans faire de bruit et avec toi
Notre équilibre est plus joli 

Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras compter sur moi et sur tes doigts 
Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras chanter, celle-là elle est pour toi 

Tu es pas tout seul là tu es tranquille faut pas t'en faire 
Tu peux déjà piquer des jouets à ton grand frère 

Tu me racontes des histoires un peu décousues 
J'ai tout suivi mais j'ai compris que le début 
Tu as tes mots que tu remixes à ta manière 
Combien de temps encore voudras-tu réveiller ta mère? 
Ces petites choses qu’on aimerait vivre encore un peu 
Tu peux déjà nous rendre sacrément gâteux 
Tu peux déjà avoir tes petits moments d'orgueil 
Et quand tu perds au Memory, tu fais la gueule 
J’te laisse bouder je joue au papa insensible mais à ce moment là
T’es encore plus irrésistible 

Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras compter sur moi et sur tes doigts 
Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras chanter, celle-là elle est pour toi 

Tu peux déjà faire tellement de choses bien mieux que moi 
Danser, courir et puis rêver ça va de soi 
Un p’tit bonhomme avec les plus gros yeux du monde 
Et tellement bleus qu'on peut se noyer chaque seconde 
Tout est si simple que même ton rêve paraît normal 
C'est de voler dans l'espace avec les étoiles 
Tu peux déjà te moquer de moi et te vanter d'être le premier
À m'avoir vraiment fait chanter 

Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras compter sur moi et sur tes doigts 
Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras chanter celle-là elle est pour toi 

Tu peux, tu peux, tu peux, tu peux déjà 
Et tu pourras compter sur moi et sur tes doigts

Grand Daddy I.U.,"Aight, let's go
Yo you
What's your response to the M-C's down there on the corner, man
Talkin' about doin' you somethin', man
What's up with that?

First of all, man
No M-C in the world can get with this, gee

Yeah, I know that, but you know
Well, this guy is talkin' that foolishness

I tell you what, gee
Yo, line em up

Turn on your radio, here we go again
It's time for the you to flow again
Mellow and smooth, blowin' cool like a summer breeze
Just like leaves from the trees, you dumb M-C's
Are gone with the wind
When I blow, you'll all end
So fasten your seat belt, sit back and hold on
Brace yourself and prepare to get rolled on
And I'ma take it to your death
Watch you scream till your very last breath
I get vexed and explode like a bomb
Catchin' more bodies than Vietnam
The mic's a fuse, and my brain is the dynamite
Ignitin' when type M-C's keep tryin' to write
Rhymes like you
You can't swing it, you're doo-doo
Talkin' a lotta stuff, but that's not enough
It takes action, and you ain't got enough
So when you come, bring a army
Even your mommy, and you still can't harm me
Cause fake M-C's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes
(Back-slap ya all down like why'all were dominoes)

Who's the smoothest, that's the question
If you don't know, then keep guessin'
You're not sure? Well, here's a clue
It's one letter, the you
My technique and talent perplexes
While my rhyme flexes from here to Texas
Handsome and tall
You want to battle? Come one, come all
I crush your world while your girlfriend swings low
Get with this? Yo, I don't think so
So take a step to the back
What, is you stupid, or is it crack?
My brain flows and grows like a embryo
Suckers are frontin', but they don't really know
What damagin' a mic's about
One two three strikes, you're out
What I recite will ignite like sulfur
Bite, you might catch a ulcer
So take this advice for your personal safety
Drop your mic and get the hell away from me
'Cause enemies and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes

Nice and easy, yeah, that's how it ought to be
If it ain't smooth, it ain't raw to me
Give me a mellow beat and a bass line
Rhymes combined make you move your waistline
So listen as the rhyme is said
But you don't have to dance, just bop your head
Daddy you's as smooth as smooth can get
Bodies movin', it proves that the groove's a hit
A vocal tone don't get no crisper
Loud and clear even if I whisper
So give me a slow pace, beat with a low bass
And pass the mic and I ain't goin' no place
I won't fatigue, take a pause, or retire
Energy flows to me from a microphone wire
Soon as it's plugged up, couples are hugged up
Touch the you? Boy, you must be drugged up
Cause fake M-C's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes",Dominos,1987
Grand Daddy I.U.,"[Intro/Chorus]
(Represent yo!) You know I represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) Yeah, you know I represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) I got to represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) Daddy you represent

[Verse One: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo make way it's the you comin' through with the one two checka
The mic wrecka rippin' mad hoes with the pecker
I crush punks to rubble, chop em like stubble
Give any MC trouble, Hittin' Switches like E Double
Word to father, hot just like lava
Blowin' up spots like Japs did Pearl Harbor
Refuse to pay dues I use da ooze
And kill off whole crews like Hitler did Jews
Now who's next to flex, bring it on
You figure my skill's gone then you dead wrong like child porn
I'm game tight, so never take my name light
It's fright night, tearin' that ass out the frame right
I flow steady like the sands in the hourglass
Droppin' mad paragraph after paragraph
My staff is called Steady Flow
The Grand Daddy you, Kay Cee, Easy Rick, and Big Sno
And yo I get flam Hobbes word to grandpops
When my jam drops, you nibble my nuts like Lamb Chop
The scamp stops nevers, I demand props forever
Whatever's clever, cause I got my shit together

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Lumberjack]
Drop your mic, shut the fuck up, and don't make a sound
It's the Lumberjack rapper choppin' wack niggaz down
Snappin' necks with the vigor, break backs on the tracks
Got a punk nigga's blood on the blade of my axe
I tear off limbs, stompin' like Tims, blendin' in sendin' in
Smokin' punk motherfuckers like stems
Step up, act like you want it you can get it in three ways
On the mic, with the hands, or from the twelve gauge
Ready to flex on all you wannabe ruffnecks
What's next, I'm givin' your girlfriend rough sex
Like Underground I Get Around
And yeah I like SWV but I ain't tryin' to go Downtown
So come meet the Grim Reaper, the Crypt Keeper
Got force and just like Bo$$ I gets Deeper
I'm sick of hearing you actors on wax
Claiming you're breaking backs, you niggaz is fakin' jacks
I lay you dead in the ghetto streets, your head and my metal meets
You scream like steam when the kettle heats
So kid you better play the rear
Or like that five thousand dollar love seat
Your ass is Outta Here

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Three: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Aiyyo the only remains is bloodstains spilled brains and broke bones
You step in my face with the games you get smoked homes
I come out blastin', doin' your whole ass in fast and
It's Daddy you the smooth assassin
My name spells defeat to punks on the street
I pack 'nuff heat, my rhyme flow is fatter than cellulite
I got a master plan to blast a man
Faster than niggaz can plea, it's disaster and
Mayhem and havoc on the scene
You see what I mean, when I bust the sixteen in your spleen
To get the third leg hoes beg
The skills are nastier than a fart after eatin' a bald egg
And yo to be quite precise I'm might nice
I got more high priced hookers than Heidi Floess
Kid you better check my rep
Or quiet as kept, you catch a hole in your neck, so watch your step

[Chorus x2]",Represent,1994
Grand Daddy I.U.,"It's the number one crew in the area

The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

It's the number one crew in the area, known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

It's the number one crew in the area known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard

Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

And that's how we do. So I.U. grab the gat and let loose

Yo rat tat tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions

Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause you're marked for death",Da Graveyard,1995
Grand Daddy I.U.,"Here it is, a world premiere
Crystal clear in your ear, so listen here
Yeah, it's somethin new but I ain't no new kid
So don't fool yourself with garbage that you did
Ain't nothin changed so don't act strange
I'll shoot through your crew, so get out my range
Cause I'm calling shots while I make my appearance
No interruptions, no interference
So turn it up loud and let the bass thump
Give me the mic and watch the whole place jump
I kick a swift rap, sign a gift rap
So zip your lip, I ain't with that riff crap
I go for broke with the rhymes that I wrote
Flow quote for quote, even hit the high note
Rick picks the chicks, I tricks the fix
So sway to the way Kay plays the mix cause it's

From the Grand Daddy you
Somethin new
From the Grand Daddy you

Grab a seat and take heed to the entrepreneur
For sure it's raw, literature hardcore
I'm like but not white quite white, that's right
A parasite who bite I'll invite to fright night
So let it be known, the rap throne I own
So leave my bone and my microphone alone
I gets paid while others get slayed
You're goin out like a roach, I go out like Raid
I won't back up or freeze up, slack up or ease up
Cause Daddy you is cold chewing MC's up
I gets raw with the rhymes I develop
So all of you suckers, shut it shut it
Or I'll bend your chin and grin, you can't win
So spend ten to get in then get ate for din din
Cause in a battle I gets rambunctious
So take heed, no need to pop junk, just
Step step and bow out gracefully
Cause if not, then, my man, your face'll be
Damaged, in other words seriously hurt
This ain't Sesame Street, I ain't Earnie or Bert
When I'm through with you your crew will be residue
So just get out my face is what you better do
You want to brawl, just call, that all
But if you don't come, right 
Take the fuck out of here

Attention, class is bout to begin
Prepare to take notes, grab your paper and pen
As I teach and preach and reach any or each
Parasite or leech the you will impeach
I stomp the comp terminating frauds
While the crowd applauds for the lord of lords
I kick off like a ninja, beef and I'll send ya
Home with broken bones cause suckers I injure
And when I'm through you can pass the brew
But for now I got work to do
So no time to wait, don't debate or procrastinate
I'm rated great cause the fans I fascinate
Shots are called, plugs are installed
Fist is a ball, now it's time to brawl
Suckers get played out walks sleeves are made out
Punks get laid out and Kay wears the fade out
I do away with those who come fronting here
What is you stupid, you can't get nothin here
So play your room or be doomed to rot in hell
You're cold booty, you're softer than cat in hell
Think you can get this? Boy, don't be ridiculous
I shoot more gift than St. Nicholas
Men pretend to win but then the Kay begin
To spin and blend again and again
Before distinguished style that you can recognize
And I fail to understand how the heck them guys
Borrow and bite and not have a guilty conscience
Then grab the mic and recite silly nonsense
Battle the you, you musta flipped your lid
Cause I take your pride like a stick up kid
Bodily damage is done to those who try to stand close
While I swing and sing as smooth as Luther Vandross
Rhymes consist of consonants and vowels
And while I move the crowd you move yours bowles
Yeah, hey yo girls, tell em what this is

Cut yourself some meat boy.
Get out on your own side of the road,
And lighten my load.""

When he seen the queen steel,
You ought to seen the light in freddy's eyes.

(yes he did.)
Because for what he done to fred he spent some time in a penitentiary.
It was a day in the courtroom, exhibit letter ""a.""

",Stop Lookin' Back,1973
Grand Funk Railroad,"Life, this is an outrageous life,
We're living in.
We call this turmoil our life,
Oh, and it's gettin' old coming over again.
But we don't hear nobody,
Say what they're after.
And we don't hear nobody,
Searching for answers.
John Kennedy died,
They thought he had a solution.
We want to know,
What happened to the revolution.
Did we all get hung up in life.
And do we all know,
Just where were going.
Everything's wrong,
So a change has got to be right (man, baby).
Life, for all the rest of our life,
Will we be wrapped up in strife.
Or, are we gonna start it all over again.
We want to have somebody,
Come up with the answers.
We want to be somebody,
That know's what their after.
We hope that everybody,
Can hear what I'm sayin'.
We know that we will,
If we just keep on prayin'.
CHORUS
Learning to share what were standing on.
Learning to care 'cus it's been so long.
No one so big that they have it all.
We've got to give to the very small.
Life, Give me the rest of my life,
I want to finish it right.
So, I don't have to start all over again.
Let's get together,
For some satisfaction.
Let's stand together,
On a chain reaction.
We need somebody,
We could really depend on.
Don't wait till tomorrow,
'Cause it just might be too long.

You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out!  We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer?  You wicked overseer!
Ya hotshot, want to get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you want to follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police!

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the see-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great grandfather had to deal with the cops

What's his name? Kobe Bryant number 8 for LA

The baddest big man that we've ever seen
Meaner than Wilt, George and Kareem
Number 34 but he's not the dream
What's his name? Big Shaq and he plays for our team

Who's the greatest team in history?
This century's first dynasty
If you ask me then I will say
That would be the Lakers and they play in LA",Los Lakers Por Vida,2003
Grand Incredible,"Just think about the good things
Don't let any one or anything bring you down
Keep in mind who loves you all of us your sisters
And your mom and dad
But no one loves you quite as much as Jesus

Hold on little brother don't lose heart
You're still so young and you've come so far
Behold God's glory's eighteen years old
The most beautiful soul I know

If the weight becomes too heavy just call me up
And I'll come runnin' we all need friends
Cast your cares on Jesus
Remember me and I'll remember you when I pray
Kid just plug in your guitar and play

And I've learned more from you
Than any book I've read
And if I can help in any way at all don't hesitate",Most Beautiful Soul,2003
Grand Incredible,"We were three points down with just seconds left
I hid my face and held my breath
It looked like Cwebb and Mike Bibby could
Overthrow our dynasty
Then Kobe drove but Kobe missed Shaq could not put
Down the tip Vlade slapped it out but it was still
Alive and it bounced right to number five

And oh the skies were grey but everything's ok
Robert Horry saved the day
There's sunshine in LA with one brilliant play
Robert Horry saved the day

He doesn't get commercial spots
He just hits game winning shots
Though they haven't made a Sports Century
He's a superstar to me
The Lakers are my favorite team
I love Magic, Wilt, West and Kareem
But one day in the rafters high
I hope they hang up number five",Robert Horry,2003

Keep control... 



(Tradegy the Intelligent Hoodlum) 

When I made arrest the president  America ate me 

Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me 

They labeled me a prejudice poet 

I'm speaking the truth as I know it 

I hold on but it's hard for me to handle 

Too much lies  corruption and scandal 

Cops want to kill a brother or two 

Who do you call when the gang wears blue 

I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man 

My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger 

I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer 

Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor 

Mali troops will run through your resident 

In my hand will be the head of your president 

All you fess that made a check to throwdown 

Will rise up for a political showdown

Since they kept him locked up for so long

And his mother is hoeing

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain

About a lucky man who made the grade

I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

Skinz, listen listen to my man

I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it's loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca wanna bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I'm about to hit the skinz

Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That's right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C'mon

Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah

Nowadays I'm on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)'ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it's hard like Charles Bronson
It's kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won't hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
Cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who's the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she'll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won't be the Post
After that you know the flavor I'm ghost!

That's right, be out
Hit it off on the skinz

C'mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they're forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
But never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won't curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
Sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I'm with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
Cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
Til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I'm out

Like the Isley's, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it's OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh
It's fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don't try to show
Because I'm, the accurate man
Everybody knows it

So keep a clear focus, cause I say hocus pocus
That's all I have to say to make the mob swarm like locusts (YEAH!)

We're goin on a flight, so hold on tight
Kid Capri is on point with my man Grand Puba
If suckers try to flex they'll get twisted like a tuba
Never cause trouble, that's not my style
Always on the move, stack papes by the pile
I'm crazy on the low, but I go places though
I always do a show so you know I got dough
Girls try to sweet talk, but bullshit walk
For those who try to hawk I stab clit like a fork
I'm very intelligent, so don't try to play me
Try to press the issue and I'll bust that ass baby
I'm thick like a shake, very high yella

Grand Puba,"Alright y'all!
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on a brother
that's bound to lay more dips in your hips
More gliiiiide in your stride
And if you don't dig what's next
you got the wrong damn address

Bo! Lickshot for the blood claat
talkin that what-not, Puba come and hit on the right spot
Rhyme teller for the ladies and the fellas
and I only kick the flavor for my fellow ghetto dwellers
No rock'n'roll, it's just soul
Ain't nuttin changed, I still like to hit the hole
with my pole, smoke a stog' and then I roll
And when my corn hurts I wear a Dr. Scholl
I make beats, then I hit sheets
Then I build with the Gods to get the addicts off the nod
Grand Puba, and I drop a album yearly
And I'm very nearly really come to droppin shit like daily
My knowledge is bond, so you brothers better move on
You brought your wack style, from Trader Horn
Grand Puba Maxwell, not on the Hollywood tip
Here comes a brother more than *2 Legit to Quit*
I'm not sleazy but I like it nice and easy
Ain't nuttin changed, I still wear my hair peasy
I like to dig it, that's how we done done dug it
I tend to work for all the ones who like to wig it

*samples cut and scratched by Alamo, including
""I got a story I want to tell you"", ""I
like to tell it like it is""*

""Second time around""

Grand Puba
Check, I get boom service just like room service
And when I jump upon a stage I'm not a bit nervous
I kick the reel to rell, I never been to jail
Oops maybe one time but I had a good time
I keep my pants saggin, I'm never lolligaggin
Niggaz try to copy this they on the bandwagon
I shake my thing until I pull a hamstring
and then I call a old fling
Gotta Spike her and tell her _Do the Right Thing_
Studda do the rap, Alamo'll do the overdub
'Fore we hit these 40's G, we gotta get some grub
Grand Puba *inhales* Let me take a breather
Get you hot like a fever, you' eat swine, me neither
So don't bother, it's the new Godfather
Tell your godson that Grand Puba is the one

""Way back in, history, the Prodigal Son
was a, wealthy man"" (2X)

Grand Puba
Sing it baby, ha ha ha, bust it
No more skid row, can't get a show
Time to kick a new flow, and make the dough y'know?
I'm a Pisces I like to drink iced teas
I'm a Reese's with all the pieces
Or the Alomnd with the Joy, ten years from a boy
When I work out Puba go see Roy's
next to thirty-three, where Stud lives
You won't catch the Puba doin nothin negative
Now honey don't like me cause I won't dance like Hammer
Honey ask Hammer, can he speak Puba's grammar?
I can shake a leg if I want to, but I don't want to
cause that's what my dancers do
Now I give the next man his props
But when it comes to micraphones, c'mon, give me mine Hobbes
I won't diss the next brother to be
great that's not my trade
but every brother, ain't a brother, word to the mother
or praises to the father, you wanna try to see this
Don't even bother!
Grand Puba, for those who came late
You try to step to this, then I'll end up-state
Word is bond, let's move on and on and on
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Big up to my Now Rule brothers
All the cool ones, not the fool ones
And we gon' move it like this for the year ninety-two
Big up to my man, Positive K
Big up to my cousin Jeff
And allatha and allathat

Fiyah! Here comes the rude bwoy, ah ah!

Proper education, education
Proper education
Proper education, education
Proper education

Now let me tell you folks just exactly what I mean
The way they try to lower, the black man's self esteem
Put us in their schools and I call em mental graves
When they teach us bout ourselves, all we learn that we were slaves
Then they say Jesus was white, understand
That means that Mystery God in the sky's a white man
These two things alone make us start to feel inferior
Then we grow up thinkin' they are superior
Why does the black licorice taste the worst?
Why does the black jellybean taste the worst?
Why do the bad guys always wear black?
Why is bad luck when you see a black cat?
'Cause they're workin' subconsciously, subconsciously
Workin' subconsciously
Workin' subconsciously, subconsciously
Workin' subconsciously

Yes lord! Easy now star! Come again!

Now they gave restitution to the Japanese
You see they gave restitution to the Jews
Now over 400 years of slavery rape and murder
But I guess there's no restitution for the coons
They want to use us a tool, and also as a slave
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
Musa came to the cave and taught them Ock
The tricknowledge that the Devil once forgot
Now the ten percent rules over the eighty-five
You see we have to do more than just keep hope alive
I don't hope and I don't do dope
But I still feel the pain from my ancestors swingin' on a rope
Now pardon me as I distill on a Devil's grill
Now me trust a Devil, huh, I never will
I just catch my four grab my button, put it on my lapel
Grab my people and get out of hell
See this is why we must teach our young black nation

Knowledge Cipher, divided by Power Equals Wisdom
But you know we have to start with Knowledge first
Divine evil's what dispearse in a hearse
Situation that we in, some people sayin that we're cursed
The lack of the knowledge of ourselves makes it worse
Science that we drop, make the average head burst
So do the knowledge on the very next verse
I heard a brother say, ""I wash the clothes, I cook your food
I pay your rent,"" now is that how the story went?
Emphatically no, singer singin that weak wisdom knowledge
Shit Haji God is here to cancel it

So just ring the alarm, another Devil's dying, boooohhh
Just ring the alarm, an Uncle Tom is tryin, boooohhh

I didn't come to conceal it, I come to reveal it
The True and Living God with the son of man (son of man)
And if you ever need assistance just take my hand
Black man be prepared cause here comes the Klan
Now my great great Grand, was hung on a tree
by the colored man -- you probably know him as a white man
I seen a Oprah Winfrey show, she said that was in the past
but [bitch], kiss my [ass]
Now it's time to teach the people, why our people's not
treated equal, here's the next sequel (speak on it God)
Askin taller than the tallest wall, you ever saw
Sincere gave the God a call, we boost it from the mall
Long as it's a Devil I'ma take it

That goes to show ya, who controls ya
The Devil man when brothers went lootin in Cali
they used the corder-cam, the same as the police man
But I bet my last bottom dollar G
The brothers that they picked up won't go free
See I'm a, disbeliever when it comes to jungle fever
Aiyyo God you trust the Devil?  (Now Cipher)  Me neither
Now brothers say, ""Why you diss the church like Ock?""
Cause if church was good for us, it wouldn't be on every block
of our neighborhood, just like a liquor store, it just ain't
no good -- they represent the ten percent
Now Momma Lova has no loot, but she'll spend her last dime
to make sure her child has an Easter suit
What is this with Christmas, I just can't see
spendin your money, givin the credit
to a fat man comin down your chimney (c'mon)

Janet Jackson took a ride, she's no longer _In Control_

Give a pound to a friend, put a tool to a clown
Damn, bang, bang, bang, Jimmy Coco Puff
Who is the one who gives you nuff?
Don't answer, here comes the flavor
And you wanna ask what Grand Puba gave ya?

Some dope shit, some real live shit
Puba is the one who's givin' fits
A new style, new style, are you ready for this type?
Now, I rock hip, everybody's rockin' hype
On the very down low you might see me at a show
If the show ain't for dough then you won't see the bro

But let me slow down 'cause I know I'm confusin' y'all

I never hit skid, never date a girl if the girl
Got a kid, nah, poppa's got a brand new bag
And I never hit skins once they sag
Guy says groovy, you like to see a movie?
Stick it in easy, it comes back greasy
First to tell you  slow down
But be the second to take you uptown

I won't fall or fumble, trip stagger or stumble
Not a soft sucker but I still come humble
The next candidate, who holds all the weight
It ain't him or him, you better get the story straight
Ron Stud is my D. J. makes the girl feel like it's foreplay
Comin' like a bull, so you better yell, ""Ole""

Here's the situation, supreme motivation
helps me get the loot, and then I knock the boots
I jump high like Jordan, Flash like Gordon
'bos, Girbauds and shorts is probably what I'm sportin
Fuck what you heard, this is what you need to hear
It's the same as last year, so _Step to the Rear_
Cause when I was a shorty couldn't wait to drink my first 40
Find an ex-shorty in the hallway and get naughty
Jump on the elevator, hit the lights out
My moms was a yardie so my pops kept a stout
Ooh a young boy tipsy, that's without a doubt
It wasn't hard to tell what the Puba was about
Love the ladies lovely used to do it on my knees
Certain honey got a problem go see Puba he can ease ya
Here I am, and here I stand
Honey all that good shit tell me, who's the man?
From, here to Bangkok, I sign my John Hancock
on the contract, it's like 1-2-3 Contact
Kick shit on the really cause I do it on the daily
Straight to the hole like my man Malik Seally
I hit stunts, on occasion smoke blunts
My moms don't like me cause I wear gold fronts
If honey wants to flam it's no thing to me at all

You're still makin movies?  Man, get your corder-cam
Oops, cam-corder, but shit you know the order
Couldn't get no skins, until you got a Benz
Didn't have no friends til you started makin ends
I see it daily, weekly monthly yearly
Think you got it goin on?  Really
I never sold gems to the bums in the slums
Only robbed devils, made a few number runs
Brothers round my way they like to blabber at the gums
Just jealous cause I got it by the tons
Twenty fifty hundred, is how I count my bills
Then I take it slow because it runs into the mills
Brothers try to step to this but all they catch is chills
No frills, Puba pays the bills
Ron Studda spin the wheel back like his name was Pat Sajak
on Wheel of Fortune.. that's how we keep it scorchin
Alamo HEY, Sadat X HEY, Baby Pop HEY, now let me keep it rollin
This is just the way I move to keep my pockets swollen
Lights cameras action here comes Mr. Satisfaction
I be maxin and relaxin til it's time to jump in the action
Now for grown I speak with a tone which I choose to call my own
Ghetto prone I guard the zone like the kid from _Home Alone_

I'm not havin' that, No I'm not havin' that
You gotta do a lot more and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man who's lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect and then we will see
So if you with it, the drop the 7 digits
And I might just give you a call

Aiyyo give me that microphone

and I'm always staying freshly dipped on 1-2-5th 
where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin spliff

How should I plead forever thuggin on a quest to get G's
Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't want to see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 
before the penitentiary

I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!""

So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey!

When you throw the drop check em thoroughly 
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days

Yea she had the Gucci boots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute

Grand Puba,"Intro:
Yeah positivity over comes negativity check it. 

A gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat
So stop with the black on black  (x2)

Verse 1:
We got black on black
Black on crack 
Knowledge of self is what the black people lack
Grew up in the projects with the welfare and the food stamps
Modern day concentration camps
Where we lost all our unity
Because the negativity pulls us down like gravity
Black people on eath others back 
Little shortie sedated thinkin' the way out is by selling cracks
I seen black borthers cry like day by day the number multiply
And the devil don't give a damn long as a black man kills another black man
It makes his job more eaiser 
As the tick goes with the tock he's just gettin'  sleezier and sleezier
Here's a good example of yourself 
Talkin' about a devil on a record they put you on the shelf
As long as you talk about ""Yo I bust this nigga and I bust that nigga""
You grow bigger as a rap figure
But that's still black on black welcome back 
It's time to graduate from that

Hook:
Change gon come change gon come time to free the dumb time to free the dumb
(x3)
Change gon come say what say what so get up out the slum

Verse 2:
Now let's deal on the real don't you set sick of this?
The way we hate eachother the shit's ridiculous
It's time to move on to the next phase 
Cause there's too many shorties gettin' boxed in the grave
Some think respect is an uzi or a tech
But when he steals your intellect it's like a rope around your neck
That's the 2000 tricknowledge 
That's the shit you won't learn in college brother
You get to be strong you got to hold on
You got to know the ledge before you hit the edge
Time to get wise and civilize
Open up your eyes all three eyes and recognzie
What your doing all that bullshit you pursueing
Put your whole life on ruin
Let's kill the black on black vigga
Cause it only gets us locked up or in the box quicker
And that's ain't how you get the cheese
Cause now ya locked up or gunned down by your enemy
But I'm a deader that gat
Remember a gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat 
Word is born 

Keep it true God keep it true (x8)

I'ma tell you now that girls just ain't right
Let me tell you bout this episode I had last night
I takes me a shower then I grabs a quick bite
Then I called Doogie Love to find out the kronkite, dig it
Somethin's goin on -- an industry party downtown
I'm comin to get ya nigga so, listen for the horn
Before we hit the location, gotta pick up Alamo
and get a bag of situation, now we downtown
four blocks from the spot, time to park the car
Honies outside, knowin who to give ?
But you know how niggaz from the projects are
Free drinks til ten, yo money, where's the fuckin bar?
Honies all creamed out types and all lookin cute
Me and Doogie same ol low-top baggy jeans and boots
Body bangin, tits hangin, while we profilin
Me and Ali' mad geeked off Long Island
Uhh!  Picture that, but then it dawned on me black
honey set them traps, that's why Tyson was where he was at
They want you for your name and fame, quick to get buttnaked
When you play em out, they run and said you tried to take it
That's why I don't talk to those, who like to pose in videos
with no clothes, and groupies at shows
Cause I know what's goin on, you won't catch me in the wrong
Don't even try it baby, dig it

Chorus

Well times is gettin drastic, time to pack the plastic
Slide up in the wrong one, you'll end up in the casket
No not me, I'm more careful see
I make sho' I can't catch that old HIV
But I tell you entertainment is some shit
These groupie girls are sick
Do most anything so they can get picked
to come to your, room, smoke a little, boom
Hear a little tune, after that, zoom zoom!
No thanks, I'm only here for the bank
And I'ma tell you point blank, won't let my dick walk the plank
I hate to bust your bubble, so be out, on the double
Cause I know how you groupies are, and I don't want no trouble
So give me my cash and I'll pass on that ass
When it comes to hittin ass, on the road, I'll just fast
	But don't you talk about skins all the time?
Baby not ALL the time, but, when I do talk about skins, they mine
I refuse to go out, like Magic Johnson; have to retire
cause I touched a live wire, now my shit's on fire
I travel in the name of Allah
Won't be a fallin star for no hooker in a bra, that's dead
You won't, roll me out, on a stretcher
cause my second head, led my first head into bed
So baby gets to steppin, be gone

Step four: now its time to leave this place

But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star

Its no doubt I come real with that

The one that makes the honeis hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit 
So just move like I'm simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds

I'm gonna hit you where the drip go drop
And make your whole body tickle as we smack the nine-nickel, so
Here we come, here go that flow son
I be the one who get it done and I ain't done until after honey come
You see my flow is great, no greater
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a motherfuckin playa hater
Cause they hungry like wally gator
Why jealous niggaz try? I ain't woody and this ain't woodpecker pie
Is it cause who we be
They hear us on the radio and see us on tv
Or just, playa hate us, be undercover
Jealous cause we mc brothers
That's the way, it, goes
You know it's 2000, playa haters need to stop, come on

Chorus

[puba - over chorus]
Yeah
Tryin to jam wreck for the next man, yaknahmsayin?
Cause they don't understand, you know?
Playin that game, yeah

See I'm the type of guy that'll say - hey baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far, dig it
Cause I'ma put it on the mornin, if it's on it's on
When I'm goin I'm gone, it won't stop the dawn
But I be careful cause the monster be lurkin
Some honies got it bad where them rubbers don't be workin
Some stinkbox are like that park called jurassic
Slide up in the cut, it burns your rubber up like acid
So if you're playin them games, you best be careful
Don't let the 5-1-6 make you dareful
There you go, feelin good, you're out of town
And it's one of those nights, you feel like gettin down
You ain't choosy on the honey you picked
No glove on your stick, you just wanna hit it quick
So you get down for your crown to represent
Honey's runnin somethin, cause that short stay loot is spent
There you go, slidin raw dog again
Now you're singin new edition song, ""is this the end? ""

""Grand Puba is"" (very special) uh ha uh ha (x4)

Verse 1:
Now many guys may come to you 
With a line that isn't true
And you, pass them by (pass them by)
But it doesn't mean a thing
Cause Grand Puba got that game so won't cha, let me try (let me try)
Now just because I drive a Mercedes Benz (whooa yeah yeah)
That don't mean I'm gonna be trickin' on skins
See all I'm sayin' is (la la la la la la la la love me)
It's Grand P (twist the L yo twist the L)
See I'm sayin' just (la la la la la la la la love me)
It's Grand P (twist the L yo twist the L)
Here goes the man with the pecan tan
The one who flims the flam the one who plays weak MC's out like ham
I got the style that be bangin'
When the flow gets to slangin' 
I be leavin' MCs hangin' 
On my jammy just swangin'
So many brothers try to be me
Only two can probably see me that's Ray Charles and Stevie
My shit knocks from Lincoln popcorn down to Frangle Rock
Me turn pop?
Save that shit for Arnold Redenbach
Cause when it comes to this see Puba's not a stranger
Get the honies hooked like they kids is hooked on Power Rangers
And I ain't goin' now where word is born 
Cause I've been doin' this since Shay Shay Lafon
I tell my record people everyday 
We do this my way cause when it comes to my music I don't play
I'll came and slay ya or I may ah
Make sure my gettaway is more swifter than O.J.
Because...

Hook

Verse 2:
Well who dat who do dat?
It's Pubat well true dat
While some try stealin' but they just keep failin'
Cause there's nothin' but smooth sailin'
The way I bring it to ya hon 
Leave another stuck my scoop is how I get it done
There goes the little drummer boy so purumppapumpum
It's Grand Puba hon I hit it ruff like ? and still puffin' stuff
I smack some mingos and sit back and watch my pockets fluff
Grand Puba here to get the party strarted 
See I come with thee exotic
While you're puffin' your narcotics
I'll be damned if this don't hit cha where it's suppose to get cha
I keep it flowin' now would I bullshit cha?

Here goes the tizm, get ya lifted like izm
If these devils ain't got my money then i got some off the prison

So don't even come with that 69, hon
cause i told ya last time, 68 and i owe ya one

Is leaving your empire in ruins

(Tradegy the Intelligent Hoodlum) 

When I made arrest the president  America ate me 

Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me 

They labeled me a prejudice poet 

I'm speaking the truth as I know it 

I hold on but it's hard for me to handle 

Too much lies  corruption and scandal 

Cops want to kill a brother or two 

Who do you call when the gang wears blue 

I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man 

My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger 

I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer 

Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor

In my hand will be the head of your president

Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip 

Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip 

Of the ropes and chains that kept us 

Since we were black they didn't want to except us 

But it's ok, I got my own plan 

'Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program 

The natives cook, wash and clean 

And to the rubbers that throw in the scene

Now you got a chance to hear what he say 

Since they kept him locked up for so long 

'Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong

(Grand Puba) 

Yo bust it 

Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig 

Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits 

Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi 

Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends 

Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy 

Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy 

Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids 

And the man caught a nice thick bitch 

Now the bitch is on skid 

Screaming how she hates her kids 

The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy 

Think slick, she better get wit the wick 

'Cause foul, foul, foul is your style 

You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile 

See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song 

How long must this go on

Power now or never, together forever 

And ever, sever make it endever 

To enlight your brother when 

I recommend to extend a hand 

Expand it then wish strength to fend 

Black women and men from the white power structure 

They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya 

And you gave birth to a nation 

You freelabel laid America's economic foundation 

Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years 

But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears 

The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables 

Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels 

And years of classroom fables, fiction 

Fallacies all sorts and fabrications 

?For sarge? even fuss 

Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts 



Chorus 



(Chubb Rock) 

I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen 

And knowing his father slowing 

And his mother is hoeing 

And now should he be growing 

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts 

In the soul of the youngster 

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain 

Drys and open your eyes for the insane 



Chorus",Keep Control,2001
Grand Puba,"The first time I hit the wax it was the news of my block
Everybody in my neighborhood said ""Puba don't stop""
It was a four-man crew, Don Barren
My Mighty Shabazz, Dr. Who, and me, Grand Pu
Things started blowing up on a quick fast
Doing shows, buying clothes, getting crazy cash
I still stayed the same, ran around with my hair nappy
Matter of fact I'm doing good, made the jealous ones unhappy
""I knew you would make it"" was their favorite line
But ""Fuck that, I hope he fall"" is really on their mind
Just because I found a way to make my pockets stay fat
Now a new thing: ""Puba thinks he's all that""
Yes, but there's a found way to better my condition
""Bad luck, bad luck"" is what the jealous ones keep wishing
Oh a crew broke up? I knew they wouldn't last
But I refuse to lose so I bounce back on that ass
One for all, Brand Nubian
Yeah, that's the new thing, now they back up on my ding-a-ling
Run and tell my girl, ""Yo, Puba did this
He did that,"" cause they nose is in my crack
Like a reporter, but they don't earn a quarter
To do that (Yo, they just jealous, black)
You know the flavor, of that jealous behavior
I'm just like Jesus Christ cause I'm you're modern day savior
So hon knock it off, worry about your own shit
Just because your man ain't shit, there ain't no need to rhyme
Same ones that used to wave, now they sticking up their finger
But I guess that's the price you pay when you become a rap singer
I work hard, word to God, with supreme motivation
To find a way out since '85, try to jam my situation
But that's okay because my old Earth told me
""Keep on moving, don't stop, hon""
Now I'll be damn if Grand Pub don't get it done
I've no time to slow my roll on a jealous one
See I love to help others because Puba cares
I do more for my people than WIC or Welfare
Next time you see a brother down, stop and pick him up
'Cause you might be the next one stuck

Word is bond, let's move on
And we building on the situation of that in lyrics
Always trying to hold the black man back
We can't live like that, we gotta help each other
You know what I'm saying? Brother to brother
Sister to sister, know what I'm saying?
Stay out my business, worry about your own, know what I'm saying?

It ain't a problem that I can't fix
Got DVD and navigation up in the whip
So if a bird give me trouble
Put her ass out on the double
Give her bus fare and call it a day

With these chicks who have conscience
That's why my two-way got caller ID to block the chickheads knockin'
So let's get it on, let's get it on
What chu' sippin' on, something strong, something strong
Grand Puba to the t-o-p

Came up from the food stamps to big shopping sprees
I'm only speakin' French to chickenheads, oui oui
Cause I was caught up in all this physical attraction
Now I'm strictly Benjamin and Jackson
It's all day, everyday we don't play
Watch me and shorty blend like we Hen and Alize'

All day (Uh) all day (Every night)
All day (We keep it tight) all day (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook]

Grand Puba got it, just like Sam Goody
So let's go ahead and get this started
Shorty gotta be a half a dub if I parted
Equal to my whip because I only ride exotic
If she not, watch me indo her when I do cotic
WHOA! you OK
Just get up cause we keep it movin' all day
So what chu' waitin' on it's time to get it crunky crunk
If the chicken off the wall and crackin'like they Humpty Hump
I'ma put it on ya just thought I'd warn ya
East Coast, Dirty, Midwest to California
I start, explore a hot broad like Ford
Slap a H on my chest and then I handle it accord
Didley, I be the nigga with the free
If you can't use my mama comb I can't bring you home
So hear me when I say
We lay it down like big breads on top of Parkay

Let's talk about it, huh

[Hook]
If ya have a kid with a chick then I hope that chu' love her
There's no stress like Baby Mother
Some of these girls use a baby to get back at a brother
Cause it ain't the same as it was
Some cats bounce, leave the chick to play the daddy and mother
It's all about the kid and not her
If you and her don't work out then you still gotta handle your's nigga
So handle your business nigga

[Verse 1]
She got chu' for everything
The crib and the whip and the bling, ka-ching
Now if ya ain't feelin' shorty like that
Then you better put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on
And shorty if ya feel the same back
Then you better tell dude put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on
There be a whole lot of seeds made from Hennessey and trees
Once you raw dog hit it
The ya ass done committed
Cause ya dick is thinkin'
Too many trees, too much drinkin'
A one time resentment got you a lifetime commitment
You hate her now
You tell her get rid of that shit
But she had three abortions already so she's keepin' it
Now ya got drama with ya soon to be baby mama
Nine months of pregnancy
No hair no seed
It takes two to play
Connect that seed with that ay
So ya better strap it on if ya goin' all the way
Best night of ya life could be the worst of ya days
She'll have you unjust rappers talkin' bout chu' got to pay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now it's mommie's baby, daddy's maybe
If it go like it supposed to then the shit go great
You know what's up, if in doubt, do without
Or get that funny feelin' when ya ass is pullin' out
Like, what I just did
I hope I ain't make no kids
Every week you callin' (Yo you get cho' period?)
Some cats handle they biz some leave mothers stuck
Seed growin' up not knowin' who they daddy is
Misguided, undivided, tryin' hard to find it
Only seein' life one-sided
Come on do you
But if you got a seed make sure you do em' to
The same fuckin' way that chu' would do you
That's what's up, some more hood drama
And the baby daddy frontin' and it just be baby mama
A little bit of something
Is better than a whole lot of nothin'
Cause nothin' from nothin' leave ya nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So tell me why oh why
Why did I hit that straight up
I hate them chicks who threatin' niggas with that court shit
That support shit, knowin' a nigga bought shit
You don't want her so she really on some sore sport shit
It ain't about that seed no more, it's all about what she can get
But that's that bullshit but that's how some of em' do
There's only gonna be more drama if ya find somebody new
Now she hatin' you, ya ass is really due
If this new chick that chu' got is lookin' better than she do
Cats be flippin' too, soon as she find somebody new
They be loungin' in the crib, you be like who the fuck is you

Stuck in the slums cause all ya pockets got is bread crumbs
That's when ya moms stops frontin'
You ain't gon' lay around my house all day, doin' nothin'
Playin' PlayStation, deuce deuce and hide ya bluntin'
Better get cha' ass up, get a job or do something
Close my door, I don't want to hear that shit tonight
She right, sleep all day, run all night
Tryin' to live nice in the gangsta's paradise

They want to play the club, stress a dude with the hottest car
That got Mo and Cristal lined up at the bar
Whether they entertainer or ghetto superstar
Not all chicks are like that but you know who you are
Actin' like Frank BaDoob be pimpin' you
She trickin' fuck it
She want to glass of champagne out the bucket
Here bird, I mean love then you take it home and pluck it
Write it off, a business expense, tax deducted
Now you gased up like bean soup
Think you in the loop but you back in the chicken coup
In the biz I got trickin' recruit
Last time you seen him when he dropped you on ya stoop
The man don't want chu' and the next man dissed you
Seems you got caught up in them everyday issues

Who's honeys kind of thunder but they like to hold within
Frontin' pullin' jiu knots outta places
Hand full of aces outlined with big faces
Spend ya last dime for a nice piece of shine
I know, I did it when my ass was runnin' blind
False advertisement, you want to front for the chicks
Meanwhile ya seed need a pair of kicks

Cause I got shoes from Crocodile Dundee
Ya flossin' poppin' bottles like ya hit the lotto
Got chu' poppa livin' like you Ricky Ricardo

Funny how every time I turned around, you was there
When it was time to get your hair, your nails and your gear
But at my court date, you failed to appear
For my case on appeals, it took over a year
In that time, a nigga didn't see nor hear
Got to the point, there was no respect at all
I was shocked when you did not collect my call
Spent nights in my cell just beatin' my dick
Thinkin' bout, how we used to fuck and shit
I took you out, bought cha' ass a bunch of shit
When I get out
I'm gonna fuckin' punch this bitch right in her mouth

You were there when I bought the rock that blinded you

Did you see what the cat dragged in
Take it on the chin
Catching fire on a roof of tin

The right to teach us our direction

True imprefection


I'm looking for a new direction
Where in the world am I?

And then you took me out to climb


Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Kissing the spires
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher

Inside of my head
I heard what the good lord said
""beware"" he said
If you don't you might end up dead


You suck the air right out of me
But though you suck you cannot see
That life and living are not free
Though you live you do not breathe


I'm looking for a new direction
Where in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection
And then you took me out to climb

I have changed
But still my heart
Remains intact
And true love stays
But will our hearts
Retain their lack of


No sense and no direction
Who in the world am I?

And then you took me out to climb

A blanket in the summer evening breeze

Then one day they took you away
And all of a sudden your mom called me
And she said: ""No, she's not the one for you""
Yeah, your mom, she always hated me
So just leave her broken, please

I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
That's because they record company wouldn't spend dough

Yeah, my label got a hook up with MTV
But they just keep forgettin' to tell 'em 'bout me
They try to play like its love and it's family
But all my marketin' dollars goin' to, shh

Clap ya hands and to the beat, y'all
Because the heat'll make you, clap ya hands and say
You go the one for the cash, two for the safe

My bars are like a bullet, blow your head right off
Hate on the trigger, pull it, give your mouth a night off
Give your sound man a c-note to cut your mic off
The promoters need me, nigga, you just a write-off
After that, hit the dress room, turn the lights off
Score on the fourth broad, let her break my pipe off
I used the word 'off' seven times in a rhyme
You dumb enough to think I got a limited mind
But before you start tweaking, critiquing, pressing rewind
Einstein understand, that your third eye's blind
You lack creativity, that's why you don't sign
They calling me a genius, it's about time
I'm like the tattoos on your mama's behind
I bounce up and down, and at the end I'mma sign
And I will humiliate anybody that want it
I'm back on stop, it hurts little homey, don't it?

It's obvious these clowns don't know who I am
Most who didn't get the message, nigga, check the spam
Get your facts right, take your dick out your hand
No homo, but you probably on the low-low, damn
They call Uncle L, I'm from the north side of Queens
Now you looking at me, like what does that mean
It means I crush you and every coward in between
For sounding like girls with them sweet sixteens
And I don't give a fuck about who's old or young
From what I hear, the graveyard got room for everyone
Test Big Ellie, come and get your head sprung
Which coffin you want, the blue or the red one?
I ain't gang banging, that ain't the motherfuckin' point
The point is, I spark these niggas like dust joints
The point is you gon' pay me what you owe me plus points
Listen to the sound of revenge, it's my voice

Run around talking bout I'm twice ya age
But I was rich at 17, you got some shit to explain
Rap game's like a movie, niggas playing the role
But your poker game's too weak, you're forced to fold
All this hating and debating shit, made me cold
Ready to blast, separate ya body from your soul
Conniving ass cowards get dropped in a hole
These niggas is shook like Pinky's ass on the pole
I'm the bridge over troubled water, pay my toll
I'm the rules to the game, you obey my code
I'm the center of the bomb, I'm the part that explodes

You are not a king nor prince, you just a toad

Well just hop on because you can't get in
But just be carefull how you (sit down)

I'll even be your chauffeur and drive you from town to town
You ought to be glad that I let you cum

That's when I put my black Caddy in cruise control

Because my horn is workin' fine,don't believe me
Come blow it
Not Mercedes,BMW,Porsche or Masarati,it's a big fat stretch

It's designed so they never make one like mine
It's rammed through many towns
Really got around (did work,done damage)
And it never broke down

Take it out my garage and scare the (shit out of girls)

When I saw this flygirl who needed a boost
So I dipped into her bumpers with skill and  with class
She screamed.""Harder,won't you give me just a little more gas""
Doin' my best so she wouldn't feel inferior
She said ""I like your nice plush vinyl exterior""
She was holdin' on tighter than a figure-four leg lock
This is what she said the first time she saw the jock

Because someone is talkin' yours as well as gettin' his
You can front and ignore,but one thing's for sure
I'm gettin' mine,so you better get yours

Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours

Get yours everytime the opportunity knocks
And don't chill-out too hard or you'll be out of the box
Stop running your face and try to listen instead
Or you'll be known as a loud-mouth Joe Rockhead
Success is out there for everybody,take it from me
Achieve without a license or some sort of degree
And if they claim you can't do it,this is what you say
Yo follow,lead,but get out of my way

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

Why sit at home bummin' just a-wastin' your time
When all ya gotta do is seek an' you'll find
What you want out of life,it's there so get it
If you don't,then later you'll grow to regret it
You can ignore and think I'm talkin' out loud for my health
But don't ya do it for me,just do it for yourself
And if you need a little push,here's food for me thought
We know that you can do it,so take no shorts

Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

For those sittin' back coolin',relaxed,gettin' fat
Waitin' for the right thing to come and drop in your lap
You see,you don't want to try,just let time fly
While your life goes by before your two eyes
You got to crawl before you walk,you see that opens the doors
Because you can't start buildin' from the sixth floor
If you work real hard,all your dreams will come true
If it happened to us,it can happen to you
The world is yours for the talkin' so what you waitin' for
You should be contemplating on how to go out and
Get yours

Get on top of yours game as your confidence grows
Never take a short,give-up no slack
You can't make it with a monkey ridin' on your back
Got to get up to get down,get on over the hump
Let your feelings flow and adrenalin pump (ugh)
Stay on your guard,never take three strikes
Get everything you want but get the best out of life
Ya see,what your future holds is no mystery
When you're the one who's in control of your destiny
Just put that weak pride aside,go make it or break it
You don't need it,then leave it,someone else will sure take it
An eternal flame burns in everyone of us
Turnin' the negative things in your life to a plus
Workin' real hard beats the competition
So what you waitin' for,you don't need no permission.....

Grandmaster Flash,"The house that rocked (x5)

I was walkin' down the street,cold playin' the post
I was takin' my time
I was chilly the most contemplating and debating about what I should do
I made a sharp left turn 
And there was my crew lookin' for a Def Jam in order to rock
Because it's gonna hit the fan at 12:00 o'clock
Then there was this flygirl,she said she wanted to know
Why are you all dressed up with no place to go?
She said she'd take us to a place where we could hear some hip hop
But little did we know she meant the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

She was a real flygirl,dressed in leather and lace
She looked pale ""Yo"",I thought it was paint on her face
She said it was the last house,corner rockin' bird lane
But you might need a cross and a little wolfsbane
Well we were at the door 
And when it opened inside there were freaks galore
Their eyes glowed as if lit by an eerie light
I said ""I don't think I should have came here tonight""
And when I asked her what was up,he door slammed and locked
She was gonne and we were,trapped inside the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

Zombies were on the floor and what do ya know
They were doin' the Pee-Wee Herman,what a real creep show
Creatures were playin' cards (Igor was cuttin' the deck)
Somebody screamed (There's Dracula,cover your neck)
Now Lurch was rockin' the mix and on his shirt it read
The music hideously provided for the living dead
Now they was illin' and that was no doubt
But all we wanted to do was get out
I was wishing I was chillin' back around the block
Instead of running for my life inside the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

It was a grizzly situation,very gruesome indeed
And would you believe tha walls started to bleed
Frankstein was steady scheming as he left the room
In came the Mummy and the creature from the black Lagoon
They said ""Your time has come"" you could scream and can holler
But you're never gonna leave this little shop of horror
You can think that it's a joke to have a heart full of fear
But you feel that way because you're not here
Take heed and stay away,whether you like it or not
'Cause those who enter never leave the house that rocked

Grandmaster Flash,"Hey people,we got a little something
That we want to tell you all,so listen
Undestand,""Yo God made one no better than
The other,every girl becomes
A woman every boy a man""
While you're livin' in your mansion
Driving big cars,there's another
On the street cold sleepin'
On the ground
So when you walk by,""Yo,don't act
Cold-blooded,'cause it just ain't
Fair to kick a man when he's down""

'Cause,He is somebody
Like I am somebody
You are somebody
Like I am someone

Whether you're here or you're gone
Right or you're wrong,you were meant
To be somebody from the second you're born
Don't criticize and knock one another
It ain't really that hard to just be
A brother,so be good speak up
Don't wait for it to happen,life is
Passing you by and homeboy
You're cold knappin'
Don't get hung up on what you're not
Be proud of what you are and whatever
You got!
'Cause it's a cold cruel world causing
Kids to cry,if you're hangin'
Your head,cold kiss it goodbye
Stand up for your heritage,rejoice
In the fact
Whether you're red,white,tan
Yellow,brown or black

'Cause,He is somebody
Like I am somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

There are fireman,bankers,messengers,preachers
Brokers,policeman,executives,teachers,journalists
Janitors,architects,doctors,restaurant workers
Nurses,chief rockers
If you feel you're somebody
Be proud and show it!'Cause everybody's
Somebody,(Ugh) and ya know it
It doesn't matter if you're black,white or Chinese
Livin' in the States or reside overseas
'Cause you and I are special,same as everyone else
And if you don't believe me
You're only cheating yourself
'Cause we all got a  purpose in life to achieve
(That's a fact)And here's another
That you better believe

That I am somebody
Like you are somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

You got wealth,good health and you're stuck
On yourself
Let me tell you that you're better than no body else
'Cause you got no self-esteem,so I'm richer
And when you leave this earth you can't
Take money witcha
So play your dumb game,call me out
My name,but there's nothing
You can do that could make me feel shame
We're all created equal we live and we
Die,so when you try to bring
Me down I keep my head up high
Don't judge a book by its cover 'cause
It's never what it seems
Now I know what I'm sayin' and I feel
I gotta scream

That I am somebody
Like you are somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

The '70's are gone,it's the '80's ya'll
Grab a flygirl by the hand and ask her to dance
c'mon fellas don't be shy,just take a chance
You'll never know,it might lead to romance
'Cause the beat is cold stompin'
It'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin' out of this,'cause I'm not wit' that there
Get on the dancefloor come on take a stand
All the girlies in the place want to dance with you,my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive,I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt,just go 'head and chase a skirt
You can't help it,it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore,you might as well
Give'em what they came here for

We're gonna cold take the party to another plateu
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We want to hear Flash cut the beat up,ain't that right
While Flash is choppin' the mix like an ax on the wood

(scratch)

You gotta dance 'cause the beat is finger lickin' good
Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's  anything you want to say,say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And ya'll are letting me know we're cold blowin' the rim
That's right,you're being served,served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it,we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame,you know it's only night
And if there's anything you want to get off,get it off tonight

You know what time it is (x4)

A simple push of the fade,a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin' the mix while I'm kickin' the gift
Yo' like a double edge razor,the boy is nice
When he cuts,give him room,or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold,too hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Whether you like it or not,we rock
Yo' since the day we emerged,have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo this is word
This party's rated NS for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop
Hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always on in the crowd
You want to party then act like you know,can you dig it
And if you came too ill forget it,I ain't wit it

You pick up your girl and take her to dinner
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her
Then you move real close using all your charm
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that""

(I smell your underarms)

That odor,it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic
Now I know that it's stone cold funk,I can tell
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell
That funk the aroma,that smell,that scent

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time
The more you ignore,the worse the smell grows
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose
It was the rush hour when I was on the train
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death
I couldn't hold a conversation,I was holding my breath
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air
Was homeboy sittin' next to me,I swear!
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming

Hanging at a party one night,all alone
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon
The crowd was on the floor,rocking the beat
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week

The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm
A girl said ""Look,there's Monster growin under his arm""
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh)
And they declared  his arm public enemy number one

?Done wa sing, done marseis?
?Done wa rik no dees!?

I'm seein this girl that I just adore

I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, are, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
and I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess

Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem

Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody want to rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, want to do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

Grandmaster Flash,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright?

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!

It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother

Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away

Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die

Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years
in the jail cell, tryin to hide your tears
And the trip bad, cause you tried to get rich
in the graveyards, or in the shallow ditch
It's money or time so make up your mind

Fraud, the girl he adored
Turned out to be another dirty old broad
Took all the money, told all the lies
I heard she even, slept with other guys
Nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar or two
But every lie she told he knew to be true
He loves his honey, but she loved money
	Vice (6X)
Talk about ya-yo, uhh, it's everywhere you go
They said in Miami it'll never snow
Now it's snow in the palm trees, snow on the sand
It snows all day, for sixty dollars a gram
Now they're strung out and high, hung out to dry
The air that they breathe the food that they buy
They think that they can fly, but that's a white lie

The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn

Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would want to play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh
	Vice (6X)
It's a stickup, so throw your hands in the air
And don't, ah put em down, keep em way up there
Just let me your wallet empty all your pockets
Got a itchy trigger finger and I'm gonna cock it
My eyes got wide as they pulled away
I said, 'Who are you the cops?' He began to say
'No I'm Clint Eastwood, make my day... get in the car!'

Homicide is on the rise, and it's no surprise
The bums are in the alleyways tryin to take lives
People burglarize then suicidal criminals are never idle
Court procedures at your leisures eight finger Visas circle seizures
Con man fencer, arson is a trip
Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

Er musste auf die Bretter, die die Welt bedeuten
Wollte rocken wie die anderen Rapper vor ganz vielen Leuten
Jahre ist es her, der Anfang der ist immer schwer
Wie Schönheitschirurgie und Cher, das Mic und er, es wurden mehr
Immer immer mehr, die zu seinen Shows kamen
Immer immer mehr, die danach geflasht warn
Er kriegt heute noch 'ne Gänsehaut
Wenn er in die Menge schaut mit Funkeln in den Augen
Ich hab immer dran geglaubt

Grandmaster Flash,"New York New York, big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes 
I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams 
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (ha ha ha ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Huh!

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town

Grandmaster Flash,"Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Chaka Khan

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

c'mon
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop
RAAH!

And not only that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Now for all you M.C's, you heard my story
On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the countries that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm a do it to you
I'm a show ya how I rocked it y'all all night long
But when I rock with Chaka Khan I just said

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Say what y'all
Say what!

To the D.J's scratch, you've met your match
'Cause were coming out fresh with a brand new batch
So taking you off into the galaxy
It's Vicious, Vicious, Vicious Lee!

Grandmaster Flash,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under",The Message [*],2005
Grandmaster Flash,"I said a hip hop,
Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow.  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball.  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again.  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ.  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind.  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat.
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat.
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak.
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight.
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn",Rapper's Delight,2005

Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under","The Message [Original 12"" Mix]",1993
Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens

That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy

Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue

He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street

But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you

When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!

So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cut the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside 
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes 
I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool

Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
''cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

It's like a jungle sometimes

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
'All My Children' in the daytime, 'Dallas' at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
and scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

My son said, Daddy, I don't want to go to school
''cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
if I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
''cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park ''cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun ''cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say 'You want some more?'
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me ''cause I'm close to the edge

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

c'mon
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop
RAAH!

And not only that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Now for all you M.C's, you heard my story
On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the countries that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm a do it to you
I'm a show ya how I rocked it y'all all night long
But when I rock with Chaka Khan I just said

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Say what y'all
Say what!

To the D.J's scratch, you've met your match
'Cause were coming out fresh with a brand new batch
So taking you off into the galaxy
It's Vicious, Vicious, Vicious Lee!

Smilin' like everything's fine and dandy
Sounded real good when he tried to give a pep talk
To over thirty million poor people like me
How can he say that we gotta stick it out
When his belly is full and his future is sunny
I don't need his jive advice
But I sure do need his jive time money

Land of the free and the home of the brave
But it might as well be the home of the slaves
They got me walkin' around singin' 'freedom's come'
But my body is free and my mind is dumb
The people ain't black but the house is white
And just because I'm different they don't treat me right
They done cast me aside, held me down
Dragged my name down to the ground
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
And your amber ways of untold lies
Look at all the politicians tryin' to do a job
But they can't help but look like the mob
Get up and get back, put it away
Watch the F.B.I. watch the C.I.A.
They want a bigger missile and a faster jet
But yet they forget to hidin' the vet

The thirtieth day, that's in December
Is a day that everybody's gonna remember
'Cause on that day a righteous man
Thought about takin' a brand-new stand
The name of the man is Jesse Jackson
And his call for peace was loud as action
Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't ever stop

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

Is a day that everybody's gonna remember
'Cause on that day a righteous man
Thought about takin' a brand-new stand
The name of the man is Jesse Jackson
And his call for peace was loud as action
Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

Grandmaster Melle Mel,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

	You have the right to remain silent
	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
	You have the right for an attorney
	If you do not, or cannot afford an attorney
	an attorney will be appointed to you - you are now under arrest

Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years
in the jail cell, tryin to hide your tears
And the trip bad, cause you tried to get rich
in the graveyards, or in the shallow ditch
It's money or time so make up your mind

Fraud, the girl he adored
Turned out to be another dirty old broad
Took all the money, told all the lies
I heard she even, slept with other guys
Nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar or two
But every lie she told he knew to be true
He loves his honey, but she loved money
	Vice (6X)
Talk about ya-yo, uhh, it's everywhere you go
They said in Miami it'll never snow
Now it's snow in the palm trees, snow on the sand
It snows all day, for sixty dollars a gram
Now they're strung out and high, hung out to dry
The air that they breathe the food that they buy
They think that they can fly, but that's a white lie

The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn

Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would want to play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh
	Vice (6X)
It's a stickup, so throw your hands in the air
And don't, ah put em down, keep em way up there
Just let me your wallet empty all your pockets
Got a itchy trigger finger and I'm gonna cock it
My eyes got wide as they pulled away
I said, 'Who are you the cops?' He began to say
'No I'm Clint Eastwood, make my day... get in the car!'

Homicide is on the rise, and it's no surprise
The bums are in the alleyways tryin to take lives
People burglarize then suicidal criminals are never idle
Court procedures at your leisures eight finger Visas circle seizures
Con man fencer, arson is a trip
Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

Grandmaster Melle Mel & The Furious Five,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

Grandmaster Melle Mel & The Furious Five,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

I'm in love,

That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems

But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems

there's something I'd like to say to you
You seem surprised I recognize
I'm no detective but I just surmise

You're from the place I'm longing to be
your smiling face seems to say to me
You're from my homeland my sunny homeland
tell me can it be?

Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie where the fields of
cotton beckon to me
I'm glad to see you tell me I'll be you and the friend
I'm longing to see
Are you from Alabama Tennessee or Caroline
Any place below the Mason Dixon Line
Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie 'cause I'm from Dixie

When first I crossed that Mason Dixon Line

Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

There's bound to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam

Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville

Where you lay down a dollar or two
Well you go round the bend and when you come back again
There's a jug full of good ole mountain dew

Oh they call it that ole mountain dew
And them that refuse it are few
I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug
With some good ole mountain dew

Now my uncle Nort, he's sawed off and short
He measures about four foot two
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint
Of that good ole mountain dew

Well my ole aunt Jill bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It was nothin' but good ole mountain dew

Well the preacher rolled by with his head heisted high
Said his wife had been down with the flu
And he thought that I ought just to sell him a quart
Of that good ole mountain dew

Well my brother Bill's got a still on the hill
Where he runs of a gallon or two
Now the buzzards in the sky get so drunk, they can't fly
From smellin' the good ole mountain dew

Grandson,"Now, Tommy's a good father
Two sons and a daughter
But he wakes up and he asks himself:
""Why even bother?""
If he cannot feed his family
The wage he's paid's insanity
Every day he's dealing with a new calamity

Lost his old occupation
But it wasn't immigration
It was a machine, automation that replaced him
Politicians left him, corruption since the recession
So he grabs his Smith and Wesson, says he'll teach 'em all the lesson like:

""Get down on the ground!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
I'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!
Let it rain over Washington!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
I'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!
Let it rain over Washington!""

Now first he'd lost his pension
Sunk into depression
Congress is defecting
It's been adding to the tension
Came back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing
Can't afford his medicine he took for his aggression
He needs help, relying on this system that rejects him
Took away his benefits, but left him with his weapon
Bought a one way ticket
He's entering the thicket
To do the only thing that he's thinking will make a difference like:

""Get down on the ground!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round
I'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!
Let it rain over Washington!

Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
I'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!
Let it rain over Washington!""

I'm just warning and preparing ya
There's a cold wind blowing

And it's coming for America

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Cast out our sin and enter in

O come to us, abide with us

She means it when she talks about love
It means so completely
She knows just who I am.

I’m leather, she’s lace,
We fit perfectly
She makes it so easy
To be me.

I’m strong in the head, a dreamer in heart,
I don’t finish everything that I start,
I’m easily mad, quick to the draw,
Slow to give in when it’s all my fault.
But she’s on my side through all my stubborn pride.

It’s hard enough to get back the same.

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Yeah

Now the days have grown
To years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Ooh, would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Grant Green,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches,2006
