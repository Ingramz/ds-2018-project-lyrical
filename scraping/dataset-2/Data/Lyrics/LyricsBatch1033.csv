Southside Johnny,"Here I am, baby, right where you found me 
Trying to break these chains that surround me 
If I look a little different it's 'cause I've changed 
Half-painted pictures are all that remains 

I can't let my past mistakes, let 'em bring me down 
I ain't waitin' on no angel of mercy 
I tried my best and I can't help myself 

I'm trapped again 
I can't get out without losing you 
I'm trapped again 
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again 
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again 
Come and rescue me 

Monday morning came so fast 
What a fool to think that dreams would last 
Close my eyes and it's still so clear 
Remember the night, girl, the world disappeared 

Can't let the hand of fate, let it drag me down 
I can't get no angel of mercy 
I came to stay but I got swept away 

I'm trapped again 
I can't get out without losing you 
I'm trapped again 
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again 
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again 
Come and rescue me 

Can't let the hand of fate, let it drag me down 
I can't get no angel of mercy 
I came to stay but I got swept away 

I'm trapped again 
I can't get out without losing you 
I'm trapped again 
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again 
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again 
Come and rescue me",Trapped Again,1978
Southside Johnny,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar,1988
Southside Johnny,"(N. Ossoff/S. Pecken)

We seem to fit like hand in glove together
We seem to pass the test of time
And, though I've never heard you say forever
In my heart I know you're mine

One day you're gonna look into my eyes
You'll say you know for sure
That's what I'm waiting for and

When the moment is right, you'll know it
And I'll be right by your side
Maybe tonight will be the night you'll show it
But I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

For every star I've ever wished upon
Ah, there always seemed a wish for you
For those who tell me I'm just, I'm just dreaming on
I know this one will come true

Good things come to those who wait for love
You're worth the wait I swear
Oh, baby, we're almost there and oh

When the moment is right
And I'll be right by your side
Maybe tonight will be the night
But I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

Time can only take this love
And make it stronger, yea

When the moment is right, you'll know it
And I'll be right by your side, baby
Well, maybe tonight will be the night you'll show it
But I won't rush fate, I'm not gonna rush fate, no, no
I won't rush fate, baby
I'm gonna take my time
I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

Southside Johnny,"Outside the church bells toll
For this wasteland, we call home
There's nowhere left to hide or run to

Daddy drank real hard late at night
He said, ?Without love, life's a long fight?
L promised I'd win one fight for him, babe

The storm outside is raging
I close my eyes, l think about you, babe
I think about you, girl
There's got to be something left worth saving
We've wasted too much time

And I played the fool, I played the soldier
But my struggling days are over
I wanted everything
When all l needed was you, babe

l didn't understand, I was just a young boy
All I wanted was the rich man's play toys
I didn't really care how I got there, baby

But now I've seen a thousand dreams die
In the oil fields, in the coal mines
No need to wonder why nobody's satisfied lately

The storm outside is raging
I close my eyes, l think about you, babe
I think about you, girl

Southside Johnny,"I got something baby on my mind
Well it's tearing me up inside
Well I've got to let it loose tonight

I know you can feel what I'm going through
Everybody telling me what to do
Well I need somebody to talk to

I'm different, I can feel the changes
But I can't turn back the pages
And our hearts are all we have to save us
Somebody save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
We're gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess we'll have to think about it tomorrow
'Cause tonight we're gonna ride the night away

I got a gun pointing at my head
And I put it there by myself
Can't ask you but I need some help

I got a fire burning in my soul
I'm dangerous and out of control
And tonight I've got to let it go

I can't look back baby I've tried
But it's too late for me to compromise

Southside Johnny,"I know you've been hurt
Burned by the fire
Still you held on, right down to the wire
If it was so wrong, why did you stay
When you've always had the right to walk away?

Now I understand, you have your doubts
When you fall in love too deep, it's hard to climb out
But now you have your freedom, there's no more to pay, no
You've always had the right
You've always had the right
You've always had the right to walk away

Walk right away from the one who keeps breaking your heart
But don't walk away from your one chance to make a new start

Don't walk away, baby
Turn around and look at me
I've got all the love you need
Yes I do

I offer my hand, to have and to hold
I want to give love, not take control
My door is open, darling, don't turn away
At least we can try, don't be afraid
We might last a lifetime or only one day
But you'll always have the right
You'll always have the right
You'll always have the right to walk away

I got something I want to share with you
Now let me warn you, it's a sad, sad story
But I swear every word is true

Now, money and me don't talk too much
We never got along too well
But when I got some in my pocket
I seem to have a lot more friends

I had a young girl back in Cleveland
My baby would not be true
It took me a while to realize
The evil that some girls do

I told her mother and father what I did
And they said, ""What kind of work is that?""
Well, they said I just didn't never have the fear of God
They could tell by the way I laughed

Whether you're high, low, rich or poor
I swear when you get right down to it
There's only one thing that I know for sure

Southside Johnny,"When I get home from my job, 
I turn on my TV
But I can't keep my mind on the show
When I lay down at night, 
I don't get no sleep
So I turn on the radio
But lord, the only thing I hear 
Is you whisperin' in my ear
Them words that you used to say
Well now the days grow longer, 
My love grows stronger
And the fever gets worse every day
I got the fever for this girl

He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever, 
Nothing that a boy can do
When he's got the fever for a girl
He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever
Left this little boy blue

I can remember coming home, 
See you standing at the stove
With the dishes on the table, 
Dinner ready to go
Well maybe out to a movie show
Something that you like to see
Because you were my sun in the morning, 
You were my moon at night
When I think about you, makes me feel alright
Well now the days grow longer, 
The love just grows stronger
And the fever gets so bad at night

Cause I don't want to go home

Listen baby

I know we had to try
To reach up and touch the sky baby
What ever happened to you and I
That I don't want to go home

Look at all the people staying
Saying I don't want to go home
In the night
I don't want to go home
I know the words to the song I feel
I don't want to go home
I know it's talking about the way I feel
I don't want to go home

To reach up and touch the sky baby
What ever happened to you and I
That I don't want to go home

I want to hear people laughing and having a good time
I want to know why she told me she had to go
Why did she leave me lonely

But I don't want to go home

Man he used to shake 'em down
He'd turn it up and then he'd make it scream
But then he put it down

I used to go just to watch him play
All night long
Now all I ever see him do is pray
All night long
All night long

I got a letter from a friend of mine
It knocked me off my feet
He said he saw a girl I used to know
Workin' on the street
She's the one who helped me find my way
All night long
Now you tell me that she's gone astray
Well, man, I hope you're wrong
I hope you're wrong
Well I don't know about it, it's a mystery
Wish I knew how to walk the straight and narrow
And still be me, still be me

I still go back there every now and then
Just to walk around
I can't get caught up in them memories
I'm afraid I'll drown

Southside Johnny,"I still remember, baby
Those wild, desperate times
Making love in crazy places
While the town around us died

I played on broken stages
I watched the lonely cry
You danced in iron cages
For the boys with hungry eyes
All those wasted lives

Little by little, baby
We were going down
I swore I'd come back for you
Come back and buy this town

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody
Stop me this time

No more running, baby
I paid for my crime
I'm coming back, baby
Back for what's mine

You were standing at the station
That rainy night I left
You looked so fine, baby
I couldn't catch my breath

Once I started running
I never asked the cost
Too many years and miles
To find out what I'd lost
Some things can't be bought

Everybody's colder now
It's everywhere I go
I'm getting tired of living
In a world that's got no soul

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody
Stop me this time

No more running, baby
I paid for my crime
I'm coming back, baby
Back for what's mine

Oh, yeah
I got to get back home

I don't want to confuse you
If you found something else
But I don't want to lose you
Just when I found myself

Everybody's colder now
Let's everywhere I go
I just don't want to live
In a world that's got no soul

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody
Stop me this time

Southside Johnny,"Her sweet scent lingers in your room
Perfumes the sultry Southern night
While across the moon
A whip-poor-will takes flight
A long slow descent down into the depths
Her last words echo in your ear
The saddest song you know you'll ever hear

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Ah, that's how it feels
Living with the blues

The night sky shifts from black to blue
The first unwelcome hint of dawn
Another day, another day and she's still gone
You can't just walk the streets
But you can't go home
Every word they said was true
But it's too late now
There's nothing you can do

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Ah, you learn how it feels
Living with the blues

Remember all those Sunday mornings
Singing in the choir
Remember all those languid evenings
Wrapped up in desire
Remember all those days
Just her touch would set your skin on fire
On fire

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Now you know how it feels
Now you're living with the blues",Living with the Blues,2003
Southside Johnny,"You've got the soul of a lover
But it gets lost in the wires
All the static confusion
Destroys the illusion
Of your secret desires

When I call you long distance
I can't wait till I hear you
But there's a bad connection
No communication
I can't seem to get near you

Long distance, you're so far away
My telephone never knows what to say
Electronic voices never give themselves away
Whoa - long distance

I hear the whisper of voices
They're all adrift in the trunk lines
All those words from the heart
Just one more part of a computer grapevine

But though your voice is so sold
And it's so hard to hear
When I get you alone
In the night - it's alright",Long Distance,2003
Southside Johnny,"Passion Street
(D. Locorriere/L. Preston/J. Lyon)

Streetlight dances on the sidewalk
As another day fades to black
I check my reflection in the satin black finish
Of a double-parked Cadillac

Radio blasting from a doorway
I fall in with that beat
Moving down Passion Street
Down Passion Street

Neon Leon in his shark skin
With some downtown debutante
Fat Tony bouncin' on the corner
Gets you anything you want
Yea everbody's looking for something
And this is where the loose ends meet
Here on Passion Street
On Passion Street

Yea when I'm out here, everything feels right
Oh I know true love waits for me
On Passion Street tonight

Streets sound rolls like thunder
Electricity in the air
Angel ascends from a subway station
Like the answer to my prayer
Saxophone screaming from a nightclub
Lifts us off our feet
And blows us down Passion Street
Down Passion Street

Are you sure you haven't seen my baby?
Oh no.
Here, here she goes now

Another man might get her off town
But if your the one that's like messing around
Well I ain't laughing
But something sure seems funny
Don't it

Hey Southside, 
There's something familiar about that shirt
Well eh,
I like to talk to you but I got to play a little something here.

I ask for cooking and you give me food
I ask for, and you give me,
I am asking for time and you tell me I am already to late
What you mean?
Someday, girl, you might change you mind
You realize what you left behind
I got news for you baby
I just might not wait, no more

You made it easy to live
But how could I know that purring in my bed
Was a kitten with a whip

[Chorus:]
Goodbye love, it's way past the moment
Goodbye love, stop trying
Goodbye love, can't drive it to the dead end
Fate will never unbend, goodbye love

Now I understand
When the money runs through my hands
I'll find myself all alone at the zero hour

Making love was so easy
Wearing diamonds and gold
How could I know that perched in my bed
Was a kitten with a whip

[Chorus]
Goodbye love, it's way past the moment
Goodbye love, stop trying
Goodbye love, can't drive it to the dead end
Fate will never unbend, goodbye love

And when I turn off the lights
That's when it hits the hardest
My resolution starts slipping away
And my conviction just falls from the hip

Wrapped up in desire
Remember all those days

Streetlight dances on the sidewalk
As another day fades to black
I check my reflection in the satin black finish
Of a double-parked Cadillac

Radio blasting from a doorway
I fall in with that beat
Moving down Passion Street
Down Passion Street

Neon Leon in his shark skin
With some downtown debutante
Fat Tony bouncin' on the corner
Gets you anything you want
Yea everbody's looking for something
And this is where the loose ends meet
Here on Passion Street
On Passion Street

Yea when I'm out here, everything feels right
Oh I know true love waits for me
On Passion Street tonight

Streets sound rolls like thunder
Electricity in the air
Angel ascends from a subway station
Like the answer to my prayer
Saxophone screaming from a nightclub
Lifts us off our feet
And blows us down Passion Street

We had love it was right in between
And to me it was like a dream
We had the faith together till doom
And our fathers and mothers too

And that's why I, baby
I got to get off a my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
I know you found somebody new
Our romance is true

But now I opend up my eyes
And I finally realize 
I saw it slipping away

And that's why I, baby
I got to get off a my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
You found somebody new
Our romance is true

It's all over, baby
Our romance is true
Boodbye darling

Yea this right here
Is going out to all them girls out there
That did me and south wrong, ya know?
Tell you a lil story its the reason

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Yo, eh yo me and miss thang
We run a perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples fiend
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak Smilez was your energy
Trips across seas, show you the finer things
No more burger king it was fine dine, cuisine
And if it never had it, I don't think it mattered
We were a classic like Nas in Illmatic
I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
You used to blow my 2 way up wit 143s
Da L-O-V had me blind I would had to see
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong, I don't want to get dogged
I invested three years ma, plus this song
I'm so confused, where to go? How do I choose?
I guess to find real love I gotta pay my dues

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

It seems so good, yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in my heart like nobody could
And all the long we stood, when times was hard
Even before all  this rap shit made me a star
When I was working two jobs, just to survive
When I felt like killin' myself you kept me alive
What a pair, me and you, we was a match
Different tastes, but you know opposites attract
By my side, hold my head, and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out, where the hell we went wrong
I did what I can, young cat made a man
Stayed and weathered the storm, when most would of ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now I had to turn to these rhymes
Its the only way I know to release my mind.

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Its been a while yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad, think about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad, or make me mad
I'm tryin' to move on wit my life, the wound is healed
Yea I'm just speakin' it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed, a man now
Bet you can't believe its me

You ruined a good thing and all of our dreams
Tryin' to lock me down a lifetime in the beam
Monitoring my calls, griping at my dawgs
I never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your doe was my doe
My doe is my doe
Mano why mano
We'll fought this weather
And everybody that's been through it
Then sing it together.

Soviet Suprem,"Tire le rideau de fer et remplis nos verres.
 
Allez viens camarade, on retourne au rade, 
Donne-moi l’accolade, on va fêter avec panache 
la grande dégringolade. 
Quand tombe le rideau sous nos yeux de clowns tristes 
et qu’les braves gens nous snobent 
et nous donnent du «Salut l’artiste !» 
On s’accroche au radeau pour le dernier tour de piste 
Et derrière le comptoir, on se noie dans l’cynisme, 
Hurlant le seul slogan auquel on continue d’croire

Tenté de te tuer, de tout oublier, de sauter du toit.
Tu te tortures dans ta tuture, fais le tour de tes tares
Pour savoir qui c’est qui qu’a tord.
Si tu mérites que la tantine se tire avec tes têtards, 
Un tantinet têtu, tu voudrais savoir.
Tu veux la teste, la taire, la toaster en tutu, 
La retourner, lui faire tâter du tatami.

T’es triste, tu voudrais téter la tétine comme un toutou.
Tout va sauter dans ta tetê, t’es tout ratatiné.
Et le temps te tasse, alors tu tises et tu tâtes 
Les tétés d’autres tantines mais la chair est triste.
Et le temps fait tic-tac et personne ne toc;
Tu craques, depuis qu’elle a pris ses clics et ses clacs.
Et le temps fait tic-tac, personne le rattrape;
Le doute trotte dans ta tête et tu tombes dans la trappe.

Tu regrettes le temps d’antan quand t’étais son titan
Tu tétanisais son palpitant; qu’elle était attirée
Par ton statut de matamore aimanté.
Elle était toute à toi et se targuait d’être ton tatou.
Mais tu l’as traité comme une trainée quand tu l’as tapé
Alors, va pas t’étonner si elle s’est tirée.
C’est toi qui l’as tantôt retourné comme une tarte tatin
T’es qu’un crétin, tu l’as bien mérité, tu t’es mal comporté.

Et le retour du bâton que tu te prends dans la tetê
N’est que le total de ton comportement d’entêté.
Tu fais le tout dépité, tu veux te décapiter 
Mais tu ne fais même pas pitié tellement
T’as été un malotru.
Tu fais le teckel, le toutou patenté mais c’est trop tard :
T’es muté, elle a tatoué dans sa tetê, la tartine testotéronée
De titan trépané, tout excité, prêt à tuer
Quand t’as tenté de la Bertrand Cantater.

T’es tout dépité, 
Depuis que ta tantine t’a quitté,

Midnight sun
Guiding light
Take the eye
Go skimming
Across the sky

New formations moving sound

I felt a hand turned around and saw a face",Midnight Sun,1996

Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine

Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

Desafiando la gravedad

Fly, as friends be
Sizzling, I'm chilling
Man, you twisting
You sissy, you dis me
You wish we was fucking tight
Auntie, Papa, Smoke lala
Hallah, fala, don't bother to swalla

Of weed
So give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, please
See's, no one, fly like these
Bees from over seas, we scratch our knees
Please, little one, please
You know my rhymes get tight
When I smoke all night (chorus comes in)

I be writing, writing, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more you don't want to battle
Said I'm writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more you don't want to battle

We high tech like Timbo's
Slap faces of dirty hoes
N-Y-M-B-A
Dirty combo when we play
Swirl like the milky way
Deep like my black hole
I oppose, to expose
Chemical gases up your nose
Fade away like ozone
Quazars, moves and shit
Hey yo Missy, where da clip?
I think I need a hit
Shitty bees up in da place
Wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face but aint even on the level
I pull your wig back
Let of steam like nasty pools
That heat be to hot
Melt down, now up in pot
Count down, 3-2-1, lift off
Now over tize, Venus we circlize
And mars we tantalize
Comatize like Hale-Bopp
Smoking trees non stop
Then I send a televize from satelite on Nightline
Yeah, wouldn't you like to get away
To the moon
We shine like stars
Lock down like metal bars

Don't you say no more you don't want to battle
Said I'm writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday

It was the best surprise of all
Don't need no crossroads or no scroll to sell your soul

Behind the writer of this song
Are a thousand love affairs gone wrong
You can only write when you're as lonely as a stone
(So you let the ones that you love go)

Oh how my heart keeps beating
I know it's just repeating
Feelings that were computed
Long ago while you were shooting high
I'm feeling like a butterfly
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?

Tell the hangman not to start
And wake the hermit from your heart
Burn the maps that chart your dreams
They're all just make believe

Space Monkeys,"This is the tale I'm afraids unfolding
Mini earthquakes and a gun unloading
Volleys of thoughts into the back of my brain
Taking me over like rock cocaine
I don't do junk but I'm familiar with the feeling
The ghosts are so close I can hear them breathing
Spitting their bile down the back of my throat
Ain't you ever wondered why they call it dope?
I used to run around with a head like soup can
Like a train, popping pills like Pac-Man
But beneath my skin and along my spine
I could feel a fleet of cockroaches prying
Waiting for me to take my first hit
I knew right then that I didn't need that shit
Like a window reflecting time
Livin' on a planet of my own design

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say

It's like the man said, you gotta move on up
You don't try to get high. You're gonna come unstuck
Like knocked down skittles on a pinball game
You gotta spread your mind. You know what I'm saying
Beneath the shadow of a moth you hide
When the troubles that you face become magnified
You can take your life or you can take religion
But who wants to be one of God's carrier pigeons
Speading the message like Grandmaster flash?
Or some devil on a trolley dash
Collecting souls and picking up receipts
You never taste the poison when the sugar's so sweet
And you're praying the game remains the same
Every time you dip a spoon into your eggcup brain
When the clock dtrikes one, put out the streamers
It's gonna be a good day for the dreamers

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say

Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,

Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,

Go insane, No

Third verse same as the first
Only this time the sugar hits you in reverse
Spins you around, puts you in a dream
Turns your mind into an elephant balloon machine
There's a trap set but you shot right through it
Quicker than the human eye like hong kong phooey
You forget about the funk that you've been dragged into
Surfin' a high you suck the last glass splinter
Out of your heart and it's a brand new summer
No longer are you just another young blade runner

Verse 1:
sick of all the lies sick of the compromise 
sick of the way we live our lives and run and hide 
sick of the times we turn our head close our eyes 
can you hear the cries when you gonna rise? 
stand up! my people in the place where you at? 
stand up! God's people who ain't ashamed where you at? 
stand up! if you say you know his name where you at? 
stand up! cause you gotta proclaim what you have 
rise up! no more hiding no time for crying 
you can't be the light of the world when you ain't shining 
I'm straight rhyming so you'll be straight recognizing 
you ain't trying you just sitting there straight whining 
while the whole world around you just straight dying 
so keep in mind Jesus Lion of Zion 
gave his life so you and I wouldn't be frying 
so quit hiding it's time for you to start rising 

Chorus:
Rise up lift your eyes up 
get up stand up throw your hands up and 

Verse 3:
To all my real live people in the spot now 
rise up let me see what you got now 
we blowing holes in ya speakers when we rock now 
we keep it hot now every time we rock towns 
that's how we got down every time we drop sounds 
so you know you better listen when I talk now 
cause we never stop now or let ya guard down 
cause if you got the answer why keep it locked down?

How many people want to see this rock now 
go bump it in your trunk rolling with the top down 
hold on cause I'm letting the missile drop now 
no hostages cause we're taking your whole block down

in the mall might catch me in a Hot Topic

Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas politic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done

I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs

Is get in another relationship at this point

What a fool I was to cry every time you said goodbye
I've taken all I'm gonna take from you

You go your way and I'll go mine but baby wait and see
While you sit around and pine, nothing's gonna bother me
I've just opened up my eyes that should make you realize
I've taken all I'm gonna take from you

Guess you never thought I'd say, “Run along you're in my way”
I've taken all I'm gonna take from you
Stayed up nights and walked the floor, I'm not doing that no more
I've taken all I'm gonna take from you

Waited by the telephone, the phone that didn't ring
Now I'd rather be alone, buzz on, beat you, lost your sting
I don't want you anymore, when you leave don't slam the door
I've taken all I'm gonna take from you

Who are your friends?

He wanted to scratch

Did he try to repent?

Appoggiare gli occhi su te 
Ti ritrovi ustioni sul cuore
Se intorno un´altra protezione non c´è
Un uragano che butta all´aria tutta me

Che tira fuori tutta la voglia d´amore che c´è
Un´ossessione ""volare dove sei""
Per dirti que che non dico ma che vorrei
Forse ho preso solo un abbaglio, ma ti penso sempre e se
E se non è colpa del sole allora sono innamorata di te
Mentre poi fingo reale questa mia indifferenza totale ed apatia

Perchè se questo virus d´amore è solo in me
Meglio lasciar sfumare anche se resta che
E mi farò bastare il fatto di potere fantasticare su di te

Sentir la voce che sognerò",Colpa del Sole,1996

Siamo tutti quanti in cerca d´amore,
Lupi solitari con un grande cuore
Aggrappati ad ali di illusioni
In cerca di emozioni, prigionieri liberi.

E non pensarci su c´è tempo per ricordare
La vita non si ferma qui e poi il cuore sa ricucire.
E un´altra storia sarà, senza saper se il domani la rivedrà

Dei cuccioli che giocano e si feriscono siamo noi

Until he clash with Deliah on top of the bed

Thinking that you would stand a chance
Take her home, thinking she's alone
Open de door you find her husband home

She was making baby for me
When de baby born and I went to see
Eyes was blue it was not by me

Eve meet snake, Paradise gone
She make Adam work from that day on

A constant draft from the door I can't shut
My legs are sleeping,
My body is weeping,
And I am searching.

An insatiable lust that can never be fulfilled
An annoying bug that I can never quite kill
A human disorder
A life on the border, the lack of a plan.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found.

I'm left here stripped of my own free will
My mind is set on this proverbial kill
As I fill my days with egocentric waste
Never evolving.

This powerful urge that is pulling me forth
A constant drive I am unable to ignore
Leaving my sleepless, holding my breath 
As my heart is pacing.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found

But I just can't leave it alone,

Span,"I never thought that what I said 
Could have so many meanings 
To her one voice is a harmony 
I try to say I care but no, 
It sounds like I don't mean it 
She thinks I'm a parody

And when she won't speak to me she doesn't tell me why 
I'm supposed to know what I've done wrong and make it right 

I think she's made of glass 
She breaks with the lightest touch 
And cuts me when I try to put her back together 
I twist myself to the best I can be 
But I never do enough 
I always do too much 

And when she tells me to leave all she wants is for me to stay 
And when she wants me to stay it's dangerous to leave 

When she stares at me I go down 
When that stare hits me I'm wrapped around 
When she stares I know it won't take long before I crawl 

The moments of hope are the moments of truth, 
With weapons laid aside 
And all is peace and beauty 
I could go on like that forever 
But the call was never mine 
She wins I'm the loser

She hears my words like they're doublecross-designed 
And every time she breaks she gets that cold and piercing eye 

When she stares at me I go down 
When that stare hits me I'm wrapped around 
When she stares I know it won't be long before I crawl 

She's freaking out 
I need a break

Anything at all

I need something to calm her down 
Anything at all 
Anything at all
Anything at all

It's been like this for all my life 
Everywhere I go I tend to cause confusion 
I go for peace but end up with strife 
The belief in a clear statement 
Is a painful illusion 

Everywhere I stay there's someone asking me to leave 
And every time I leave there's someone asking me to stay 
And everywhere someone stares and then again

We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us

War tactics they make me sick
Reel your heart in run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
If you know another way,
Tell them so right to their face

We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine (4x)

I pay for what's called
Eccentricity and my will to evolve
I hear them all say
That I got heart
But not everything that it takes

Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I wont sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down

I would meet him at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
Till it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk along the lane to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I lost my baby's heart
I must be back again

Sunny afternoons that made me feel so warm inside
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes
As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths for they have changed
I must be home the sun is gone and I think it's gonna rain

Feeding flocks of pigeons
I remember sunshine and you were mine

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

How can I when I think that everyone will leave?

Why would I wreck all that I have?

In every infant's cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
The mind-forged manacles I hear.
How the chimney-sweeper's cry
Every blackening church appalls,
And the hapless soldier's sigh
Runs in blood down palace walls
But most, through midnight streets I hear
How the youthful harlot's curse
Blasts the new-born infant's tear
And blights with plagues the marriage hearse

Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be, I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in a instant but gone in a flash

In these little brick a brack
The secret's waiting to be cracked
Dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see

What does it mean? What does it mean?

I've read the Christmas books many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols by heart
Skull is so full it's tearing me apart

As often as I read them, there's something wrong
So hard to put my bony fingers on
Or maybe it's not as deep as I've been led to think

Of course I've been too close to see
The answers right in front of me
It's simple, really very clear
Like music drifting in the air

Invisible but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
And so I think this Christmas thing
Is not as tricky as it seems

And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to everyone
Not anyone in fact but me
For I can make a Christmas tree

There's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do

For stripped-down thrills.

It doesn't matter, doesn't matter, no,
But for affairs with staying power
I go after limousines.
It's always nice if something big
Is acting as your go-between.
And for group encounters I'll hit buses,
Mobile homes, or trains to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
It's hard to make acquaintances in our big town;
Most eyes stare at nothing much at all.
But here comes Bob!
I ain't subtle in my ways of making friends,
Friends, acquaintances!
Instant adulation comes to some at birth,
Born to queens or corporate entities.
But here comes Bob!
Someday they'll put me away;
I'll think back on active days.

Some were worth the damaged cars,

Want to try me, I don't mind

I know my heart can't be broken
I know my will, will not crack
I know my dreams are atomic
And I can take any flack
I know it's progress

When the sun goes up and it's a brand new day
Words are invented to describe the way
Colors you never saw before appear
A sense of progress is in the air

I got a new, tougher skin
Got a whiter, brighter grin
And I think you're so sweet
Yeah, you knock me off my feet
But I bounce back, oo-wee
Got a lifetime guarantee

And I love your design
Such a deep long lasting shine
I know it's progress

You're a taste-tempting treat
Preparation, just reheat
Want to test drive for free
You got a great anatomy
I know it's progress",Progress,1984

Sisters, is this a felony anywhere

When I hear you fuss and fight
Do I have to be an acrobat

And it's shining down on me
And I know that I'm a lucky guy
That's my biography

I can hear it singing now

There are future memories

It kills your self-esteem
Makes you feel dependent
It makes you feel mean
But subtlety is useless
In breaking down a wall
And subtlety is toothless
You'd rather see me crawl
So if it takes a flashy display
To make you warm up, OK

Because you're so important to me
So important to me
So important to me
Right now

This discrimination
It's cruel and inhumane
If I had any pride left
I'd say you were insane
If only you would love me
Or just be less intense
It isn't that I'm ugly
It isn't that I'm dense
But if it takes a cheap, tawdry scene
To make you see what I mean

Because you're so important to me
So important to me
So important to me
Right now",So Important,1991

Yeah I know,you hear freeway everywhere you go
Before rap you see freeway everywhere you at
You can bounce, he move yayo heavy with the crack
Now I'm in there like Prego with the ROC

Thick like labels with mack
Now I do doughnuts on the cops,keep cradles of stacks
And you now when you hot when niggas hate on ya' tracks
And you know when you shot when bullets come out ya' back

For words coming out your mouth watch the way you rat
'Cause I'm from the streets and you will hate the way I act
With a SK, Nine, or a Dillinger pick the heat
Mad cause' I lounge in a 8 Cylinder pick a beat

Fuck it up, holla at Julio get it checked
My squad do circles like Hula-hoops with ya' freaks
Send her home after giving us neck, you can't sleep
Wonder why ya' girlfriend not giving you sex
Same nigga you told can't stop hustlin' won't eat,uhhn!

[Chorus: x 2]
Tell me how we know,
This we lead will take us places that we don't want to go
Now I really want to change,but I'm chasing change
Trying to ease the pain, shelter for the rain
I don't want to hurt no more

[Omilio]
Yo, since a buck I been a knuckle-head
Half of the stuff you said, went in one and out the other ear
You break ya' neck for what I asked for
Pops wasn't around one of the reasons why I'm hustlin' now

One of the reasons why you strugglin' now,
Wit' three one your own, workin' the night shift and leavin' us home
It's cool mom, I just couldn't got to school mom
'Cause of rappin' cause' of that you 'bout to move mom

Boy make moves mom, soon mom, trying to get us away
From them nosey neighbors and the boys in blue mom,
But I remember them times, no food in the crib
Nobody taking timeout schoolin' the kids

In school with the kids they got they Timb's on
Buttered up, it wasn't right
I'm up in there my slim's on button up, it's alright
But they ain't never clown me, they see pain up in me
I had a little Sugar Shane up in me

[Chorus: x 2]

[Beanie Sigel]
Why that cat gotta be pushin' them Bently's
Back to back like that , cause' god meant me 
You little dirty punks ain't ready for the boy
Load four thiry chunks and eatin' seventy more

What makes you say that is it cause I'm laid back
Spinnin' through them wheels of fortune like Sajak
Pump your brakes scrap, I only spit it for ya'll
Niggas like my nigga Mark eatin' space packs

Ya'll niggas want R.I.P but I'm CEO
I remember I use to see CC
Cop, cook, and collect 
My nigga Kyle use to cook it the best

But for you crooked cops I got a 40 cal that'll cook up
Ya' chest, paralyzed my man, slimmed his legs and
Paralyzed his chance, I know Allah got plans 
But still I reminisce at night this can't be us this
Can't be right

[Chorus: x 2]

It's funny me chasing change
Made my whole life change, got me a range
Slammed in the bing, freedom snatched away

I come from scrambling and gambling men
Starving stomach touching I hustle with the hand of hand men
But the ambition got the tables turning
'Cause now I coach coke up for the post
I let seven go like Chicago did Tony Kukoc
Let them falls revolve through a ski coat
Keep in mind this nigga ain't got no dough
Committed crime and all he did was switch coke
And that's gangsta
In the hood that I know 4 niggas at least 7 dead
And 3 injured and that's danger
Enough to put the cops under pressure
That's why we never listen to mami's lectures
The techs the only thing that can protect ya
That's why we scream fuck these coppers
And tote gats big enough that as soon as they poppin
Have you screaming louder then the opera
Now roam through the streets of Philly 
With a nigga so you can understand a lil betta

Yo my song is like Louis Armstrong's but instead of blowing the flute
I was blowing glocks of the roof
I've seen a lot of my friends in a box in a suit
It happens so often you don't get a chance to regroup
My life is like a song and I'm singing this sad ballad
Wearing that same weared sweater like Fat Albert
One thing about O you can't call him a snitch
Been shot nine times and never approached the bench
Remember us struggling like it was just yesterday
Matter of fact it was yesterday
Welcome to the ghetto this close to a hearse
At a funeral the first time I went in a church
But I pray to Allah to panewat the aisle
I can't crack down man I got to be a fighter
The song don't change 'cause we signed to a lable
We still caught bad breaks like Hardaway ankles

Yo now Jeremiah stay madder then a muthafucka
Till he had 40 money champagne wishes
Argues on corners with hood rat bitches
Looking at what he had for role models bunch a alcoholics and junkies
Riding in 77 caddies smoking on Woollies tote on long rusty revolvers
Sticking up young workers for they packages
Like fuck coppers 'cause basically the Rolling Stones be homeless
So when the cops catch us they don't run from em 
They figure three hots in the cops it'll be alright with em
Plus niggas they ain't seen in a while they be uniting there
Making home made wine shooting the breeze
Smoking squares at the chi chis 
Self-made whackers razorblades tape and toothbrushes
Life is school to the new comers
Shit the closest they come to the bricks
Is dialling gunya books
Life's a bitch in the beginning

Why must I push the crack
I was forced into it
I was going through it pushin' that Buick
It wasn't all good a week ago (eh ah)
Shit been bad for a while
I was forced to put that crack in the vile (You know it)
Pockets was low, mind wasn't right
So I had to play the corner with the nine every night
So I crushed competition
Killed the drama
Sold goods like Excedrin
Syrup like Aunt Jemima
Money was coming, niggas was hatin'
Send bullets through they fame till they Harlem shakin'
Treated crack like rap
And I move them units
And the way I tuck paper niggas thought I was Jewish
Had the fiends snortin' blow like the K-9 unit
And I finally got that paper to park that Buick
Got the aero dynamic Benz wagon
So carefully crafted
When I pulled on the block I just smashed it

Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?

Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

Set up shop and move rocks on the front step

We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggaz up to no good

No rules, no trees just a lot in the push
My [unknown] in the house, read my mouth
Fuck the D's got a pocket to push
Send fleas in the opposite way

Quarter to one guess I stop at the ?
Gimme a grub, count up the profit I made
Rule number one
Sell your first stack and cop you a gun

We hear gun shots, we hardly amazed
My man Willie Mays and Santana live on the run
What does it mean? not goin' back
Not gettin' caged, strong with a gat

Prepare for the raid
Listen Mothers, bodies still underaged
You better talk to your sons
Send em on a straight line from the lines

And move straight to the pen
Sleep with a blade, husky niggaz touchin they chin
Get bailed, get out and then they at it again
All for the love of the pay

Every since I don't stop waist side
Sparks had the ambition to ride
O. Town play games but I need this chain
Got me deep in the game

To the point, yea coulnd't get no rest, no sleep
All I did was hug the block
And shake the police while they shakin the bag
At age 18, like half a brick, crack got half the street

Most of my always call me ""Snoop""
'Cause I couldn't cook this shit then
So I brought all my worst stylin fiends
Runnin' back to the kid like ""Sparks man, you sold me some bullshit""

But I kept on pumpin' cause the block kept on jumpin
I'm not stoppin', I was told the sky's the limit
Plus I'm tryna to push the roads
And park the [unknown]

And let you know what exactly takes places in the ghetto
When techs blow
When the cops circle, I know the bells like ?
Run fast with that .38 special

What mean the world to you
Shit about 4, 5, 6 bricks
I roll em', cut off, spit em' the livin' room on the glass mirror

See if folk gonna test a nigga and bring the tools
Like the flutes and the two
See if that shit turn green or blue (green or blue)
Yo look here homie, this here pure coke with me
Get off me and go take the things
Guarantee get your fuckin' face freeze (your face freeze)
And so, then let me know, ya I know
You want to fuck wit me, you want to cop yo work for me
I know there's bucks involved, you don't touch the squad OK
You can bring just some your roadies
Leave two outside, bring two inside, just don't bring that bullshit
'cause we all gon time and get caught for this shit
I know your number, 'cause I once got caught for shit
In court for shit, like look Ian, I don't feel what I done was a crime
When I crossed your invisible line (when I crossed your invisible line)
When I crossed your border, with a thousand quarters
Ya'll niggaz do when they broke gotta test the waters (gotta test the waters)
You know you want to fuck wit me

[Chorus: Sparks]
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, want to cop yo work from me

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
We talkin' bout that BLOW
That B.L.O.W. sniff it
Tryin' to tell you it's the shizzit
Guaranteed you get addicted
Lemme know, how you want it, pure white, or be pecific (specific)
I just came from the Pacific
My connect is jet-o-ffical
That's how we roll, keep it comin'
Long as Chris up in position, Imma keep this shit consistent
Never bitch up at the district
Let em know, Young Gunna is just a new nigga
Bout to blow straight to the tizzle
Never write straight, off the tizzle
With the flow, I get it from my big homie Sigel
But I got my own Eagles, if it's guaranteed to meet you
We can ???, but back to that B.L.O
Got some shit that I can teach you
Know if I cook up niggaz treat you weird
Got some people, might be interested to speak to
If your strips slow, you get your men, I get my people
When we get dough, give them niggaz fore warnin'
Lock down all four corners, watch that shit flow

[Verse 3: Twista]
I'm a nigga that'll never go a broke
Two of tens always help a motherfucker get back up

Till' the city doubles fifty bricks and brothas get smacked up
Couple of hustle up real ass niggaz on the block, the hoes, you need some hard
Twista be servin' with the nigga Spark, and the rocks, blows, weed, cars
See us transform, double cocaine to a cherry 04 Range
Load the ki's in the sprees, and I'm gettin' P's
And I'm makin' G's, so I want to go in your bank
'cause you feelin' the feelin' of makin' a killin'
Of steady comin' up, Imma cop myself a whole BLOW feel
BLOW so trill, you can tell it was the real deal
Even if I hit a high with a pill
Tell me how you feel
Baby you was feelin' kinda froze
When you took a squirt up in the nose
Steady servin' O's, 'cause the fiends gotta get it
Even though they know it make they body decompose
Reafer in my clothes, and you know we cookin' up or shakin' up
So somebody close the door, watchin' for the law and gotta stay up on my toes
Makin' stacks, motherfucker, tell me what you know about that

Won't get that work across the state
Run till' they always getting' rid of the weight

'cause this is more an afterlife
Seducing you each night and day
You're never gonna break away

Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Knowing that from now on, what you do is stritly non-essential.
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me

You get on my nerves

What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?

My girl has left, my dog has left, I’ve cracked up my car
The only one who’ll listen to me’s tending the bar
He turns his back and walks away and I say, “Hey, you
I ain’t hardly through.”
He says, “Yeah, you’re through.”

Our God is great, our god is good, he loves every man
But there’s a limit to what even he can withstand
So be selective in what you slip under his door
If it isn’t war
It may be ignored

What the hell is it this time?
My god is great, my god is good, but don’t waste his time
What the hell is it this time?
He’s dealing with crime
So don’t waste his time

What the hell is it this time?
Historically, historically, we think we've carte blanche
What the hell is it this time?
He don’t take carte blanche
He don’t take carte blanche

[Verse 1: Sparks]
What mean the world to you
Shit about 4, 5, 6 bricks
I roll em', cut off, spit em' the livin' room on the glass mirror
want to see if that coke steady, OK
See if folk gonna test a nigga and bring the tools
Like the flutes and the two
See if that shit turn green or blue (green or blue)
Yo look here homie, this here pure coke with me
Get off me and go take the things
Guarantee get your fuckin' face freeze (your face freeze)
And so, then let me know, ya I know
You want to fuck wit me, you want to cop yo work for me
I know there's bucks involved, you don't touch the squad OK
You can bring just some your roadies
Leave two outside, bring two inside, just don't bring that bullshit
'cause we all gon time and get caught for this shit
I know your number, 'cause I once got caught for shit
In court for shit, like look Ian, I don't feel what I done was a crime
When I crossed your invisible line (when I crossed your invisible line)
When I crossed your border, with a thousand quarters
Ya'll niggaz do when they broke gotta test the waters (gotta test the waters)
You know you want to fuck wit me

[Chorus: Sparks]
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, want to cop yo work from me
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, lemme know you want to cop for me

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
We talkin' bout that BLOW
That B.L.O.W. sniff it
Tryin' to tell you it's the shizzit
Guaranteed you get addicted
Lemme know, how you want it, pure white, or be pecific (specific)
I just came from the Pacific
My connect is jet-o-ffical
That's how we roll, keep it comin'
Long as Chris up in position, Imma keep this shit consistent
Never bitch up at the district
Let em know, Young Gunna is just a new nigga
Bout to blow straight to the tizzle
Never write straight, off the tizzle
With the flow, I get it from my big homie Sigel
But I got my own Eagles, if it's guaranteed to meet you
We can ???, but back to that B.L.O
Got some shit that I can teach you
Know if I cook up niggaz treat you weird
Got some people, might be interested to speak to
If your strips slow, you get your men, I get my people
When we get dough, give them niggaz fore warnin'
Lock down all four corners, watch that shit flow

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Twista]
I'm a nigga that'll never go a broke
Two of tens always help a motherfucker get back up
I can hook you up with whatever you want
Till' the city doubles fifty bricks and brothas get smacked up
Couple of hustle up real ass niggaz on the block, the hoes, you need some hard
Twista be servin' with the nigga Spark, and the rocks, blows, weed, cars
See us transform, double cocaine to a cherry 04 Range
Load the ki's in the sprees, and I'm gettin' P's
And I'm makin' G's, so I want to go in your bank
'cause you feelin' the feelin' of makin' a killin'
Of steady comin' up, Imma cop myself a whole BLOW feel
BLOW so trill, you can tell it was the real deal
Even if I hit a high with a pill
Tell me how you feel
Baby you was feelin' kinda froze
When you took a squirt up in the nose
Steady servin' O's, 'cause the fiends gotta get it
Even though they know it make they body decompose
Reafer in my clothes, and you know we cookin' up or shakin' up
So somebody close the door, watchin' for the law and gotta stay up on my toes
Makin' stacks, motherfucker, tell me what you know about that

[Chorus]
[Verse 4: Oschino]
See the dope move, see the coke move
See that nigga push ki's like a pro tool
Fuck a 9 to 5, I got 95 drones all in the back of the ride
And they pure like a virgin, I'm servin'
And I ain't talkin' bout Serena or Venus
I'm talkin' bout that shit
that have you doin' 50 years in a box beatin' your penis
See the car vette, see the house vette, see the young boy diggin' ya style
And you say you love that shit
They think we Shallow Hal no it's just Oschino baby (yea baby)
I'm dippin' the man, I'm dippin' the can
I'm the reason you can dip that straw in the grams
And get high, but you wouldn't understand (It's all about that BLOW)
I'm your BLOW supplier, the hoes admire
My whole attire, my rims and tires, niggaz wearin' wires
(Actin' like they want to do a deal with O)
Trains, planes, automobiles
Won't get that work across the state
Run till' they always getting' rid of the weight
Sweatin' under pressure while you talkin' to jakes
Sweatin' in the kitchen, while cookin' the cakes
Sweatin' in the mix, puttin' doe in a safe
You can sweat me right in front of my face
And there's nuttin' you can do about it

Talking 'bout how the whole block feeling me
And how when he coming home he ride for me
See that used to be me so I feel him I got love

[Sparks]
Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?
Omillio Sparks, niggas, holla back

Tales of a hustler

[Chorus x 2]
In this life you not promised tomorrow
So take the bitter with the sweet and maintain
In these vicious streets
Carry your heat, and keep your mind on your money
Life's a gamble; everybody got a number, homey
Tales of a hustler!

I'm back to the block with it
Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

For a pound of trey eight and..
I throw bullets like Dallas Troy Aikman
The callous on my index stay achin
Niggaz stay hatin

I'm tight boot lacin
Mask on like I'm Jason

You play the pulpit like Pastor Mason

Got me back to back buckin my squares
But I ain't bitchin I ain't scared
I ain't budgin, in fact the thrill alone turns me on
Got me smiling, laughin...Clutchin
My toast and confrontin mother fuckers
Cock-a-roaches will not catch me laughin
Skinny and slim fram why'all get it the same
Cool niggaz that'll spin out they waves
Grimey niggaz that'll spin to they graves
Justifyin my foul ways
I got kids to raise
But motherfuckers rather see me sprayed
Than to see me pair (fucker)
Or see me on the front page like Sig
Or stay rolled DC with B. Sig
You bitch niggaz stay PC when why'all see me
Until the day that they
Fit me in the grave and the city wreak of me
We got the city under siege
S-P or are-O-see
Poverty is a movie starrin me

So why'all can see how my life so real
So why'all can see how my life so ill

Got a Jag and a Caddy sellin dimes of the step
Niggaz want to take my block I had to earn my respect
So I put his cerebellum on his grandma's steps
You know Oschino he'll probly kill
Got the soul of Huey Newton nigga Bobby Seale
Nigga prolly take the stand he'll prolly squeal
But I got four lawyers I ain't takin the deal (Nigga)
We could strap without scrap or put the semi in it
Gun fully loaded like the Chrysler with the hemmy in it
I keep it ghetto like a 40 with the Henny in it
Went to school broke loafers on no pennies in it
Stood the coldest winter with the bummiest coat
Need food need shoes sold dummies of soap
Got tired of bein broke man life was a bitch
They bring you flowers when you head but no soup while you sick
So I switched my whole picture get involved with the bricks
Not the ones made of semen but the ones who sniffs
Tales of hustler, niggaz come for your jugular
If you sell one bag to they mother fuckin customers
State P we got the city on smash
Got every boulevard every street every ave
Got sneakers got clothes nigga you do the math
Push to hustle but the point is just to stack that cash

Still I don't know how to do without, well I just need you now

And I'm hoping you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
I said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
Still I don't know how I can do without, well I just need you now

Not a man shall be a slave,

4.	E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
	thy flowing wounds supply, 
	redeeming love has been my theme, 
	and shall be till I die. 
	And shall be till I die,

And loving what you found
Is killing us right now
It'll always be true, living as one
Beats dying as two
We both know this can't go on

Crawl back in place
I promise not to chase
I guess this time
I loved what I could taste
What the years have lost, is
What I've gained
There's nothing left to give
After everything I gave

Crawl back in place
I'm trying not to hate
I guess this time
I'll watch you fade away

And eased the people's pain and for that

standin in the shower/ for almost half an hour
Tryin' to wake up/ and I'm lookin for the power
reachin' for the towel/ with soap in my eyes
dryin' off my shoulders,/ my chest, and my thighs
The next thing I know/ the telephone rings
I hear my own voice /on the answering machine
please leave a message/ I'm glad ya called
I listen for a voice /but there's nothin' at all

stared out the window/ and then she said

she didn't look back / said nuttin at all
I didn't change my clothes/ because they smell like you
and when I took a shower it reminded me of you
I called Gramma Brown/for advice 
it happened to me once/it happened to me twice
Michael/ my son/ you sound really bugged 
I wish that you were here /so I could to you give
a hug then she gave me/ a long, long talk
she said ""you have the patience /of ice on a sidewalk""
when things get rough/ don't sweat it
sometimes in life you just have to let it
and sing out a song / so strong
that even a bad dream couldn't bring harm
to the mind of a young childs battles 
formed from the candle light shadows

This is the time /when I am forced to think about 
all of the things/ I been tryin to forget about
The Bills, the phone, cleanin up my room
the cars, the traffic, the speakers and the boom

Spearhead,"Memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella
memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella

Well it was not -that he was particularly 
suicidal he just didn't care wether he lived or died though 
it was just a matter of time
you got yours and I got mine
when he turned sixteen 
they said he could drive
when he turned eighteen they said he could die
when he turned twenty one he could buy rum 
but no one ever taught him
how things were done
then an angel appeared inside his head
she said boy do you think 
you're realty better off dead 
he don't know he just shook his heed

(chorus)
'Cause he thought the day that he died 
would be a normal day for the people on the other side
He thought that the day that he died
would be a normal day for the people on the other side
but memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella

But time was a matter of velocity 
in this age of information and technology 
he would cry in the shower
put his face in a towel hot from the dryer
then he sat down and wrote a note to his mom
when all is said and done
can I still be your son 
because manhood is so elusive
and respect is so exclusive 
and I got a daddy to prove it 
I think I'll never get to shake it and move
then he tied a rope around his neck 
looked in the mirror and said what the heck 
I'm gonna bring the whole roof down with me 
and then he jumped

(chorus) 

""Come in Vernon'

But halt way down 
he heard what the angel said
and he realized -he really didn't want to be dead
he landed with a thump- his head was reeling
layin in a lump- looked up at the ceiling 
and saw that the rope... had broke
well he failed at the only thing
that he thought he couldn't fail at 
that was takin' his own life
and he said"" I kinda like livin'
he could feel his heart makin a boom
sounded like music in the next room
music in the next room 
he said ""it's time for a celebration"" 
felt his hands looked at his face 
lifted the rope off his throat, ""I ain't such a disgrace."" 
he said manhood is so elusive and respect is so exclusive
and I gotta daddy to prove, that some people never get to
shake it and move.

(chorus) 

And He knew that the day that he tried
was not a normal day for the people 

And memories come down and me once again

Spearhead,"I take the needle off the record 
and shove it in my arm
whenever I feel life is 
comin' on too strong 
they left me in a clinic fulla
cynical motha fuckin' bureaucrats
and other kinda ding bats

Livin on the tracks
the tracks in my arm said
it all depends which side the tracks your on.
tellin' me what to wear 
tellin me cut my hair
and tryin to convince me that they
really really care
all about my health and about my wealth
but still they built the Stealth
'cause everybody's
just lookin out for they self 

So then I ask 'em
can I have a clean needle
""Hell no that's illegal!""

(chorus)
'Cause it's a crime to be broke in America!
and it's a crime to smoke dank in America!
(repeat) 

""Yeah hit those drums now""
they lockin' brother's in the poorhouse
who can't afford Moorhouse
politicians nervous
it's the only free service they provide
you want to go inside
there's a hot meal waitin' for ya
a deal we can score ya
on a bed for a night or two
or three or four months.

They say they lockin' us up in cells
to protect us from ourselves
it smells like they got anotha
plan in store house
or should I say warehouse
fulla niggas and other misfits
that couldn't turn tricks in the courthouse
it's a justice whorehouse 

(chorus) 
It's a crime to be broke in America!
and it's a crime to be Black in America!

But there's a mutiny on the bounty 
in ever single county
we remember Attica
but don't forget to pat a few
other on the back as a matter of fact 
sister Asatta Shakur and Geronimo Pratt
'cause Amnesty international 
is fightin' for political 
but if your analytical 
you know it's much more critical than that
percentages black is really, really whack
can I kick a few facts yes?

Sx percent in college
from livin on the block
twenty five percent in prison
the school of hard knocks 
fifty percent in poverty
is livin on the rocks
five hundred brothas on a death row box

The punishment is capital 
for those who lack in capital
because a public defender 
can't remember the last time 
that a brother wasn't treated like an animal.

They say they blame it on a song 
when someone kills a cop
what music did they listen to
when they bombed Iraq? 
give me one example so I can take a sample
no need to play it backwards 
if you want to hear the devil
cause music's not the problem 
it didn't cause the bombin'
but maybe they should listen 
to the songs of people starving..

(chorus)
'Cause it's a Crime to be broke in America!

Dat's how we know we a fe we dream team 
(repeat)

The other day
A friend gave me a call
He said that the dream team was playin basketball
Was so excited / That I hadda get a Witness
The first time the NBA was in the 'lympics
players from the east/ players from the west 
And you can bet that they took the very best
(""Except they left Tim Hardaway at home"" 
""Yeah that was hella fucked up!"") 
But Anyway
I tuned in because I was hella psyched
To see Magic Johnson on the same team as Mike

Gettin crazy / Havin lots of fun 
makin sure that they got the job done 
Fans were wavin the red white end blue
It seemed strange to me / was it strange to you? 
Brotha's on the street / And everyone is scared a ya 
So how could ten Africans represent America?
Bullshit / It didn't mean a thing
'Cause in the same year / we saw Rodney King 
So I thought / That I would put a team together
A team that I have been waitin for forever 
Some a you / May know what I mean 
But if you don't then / Lemme introduce you to...

Well Chuck D'sannouncin'/ Flava's doin' color
halftime enterntainment by Dre and Ed Lover
Malcolm X is the coach he's drawin' up the strategy
he's choppin up America's anatomy
'cause they're the ones/ we're up against of course 
are general manager is Chief Crazy Horse 
Huey Newton/ 'cause he was extra hard
he's the one/ who would be playin at the shootin' guard
I dreamed Charles Barkley would be 
played by Marcus Garvey
he'd be throwin people off his back and makin 
sure they never got a rebound rebound / and
he'd throw it to the outlet
Nat Turner/ 'cause he can turn the corner when
he's out there
he be flyin through the air/ throwin passes like
he really doesn't care/behind the back /and in
between the legs
he's handlin the rock /as gently as an egg
he's throwin it in/ to Angela Davis's neighborhood 
she's postin up down in the extra hard wood
she grabs the pill/ and then she puts her shoulder down
get out the way/ 'cause she's gonna throw down now
boom /oh my god! I just can't believe it
get anotha backboard or bettah yet leave it. 
we always play for fun /but we always play for keeps 
the game is over and the loser's gotta sweep.
up the glass/ that we busted in the ass 
Set the record straight /about America's past

DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 
DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 

Well after doin that /we be headin for the ceremony 
hand on the heart /is a bunch of baloney
the spirit of/ the '68 olympics
Black power people/ can I get a witness
fist in the air/ this is proper manners
while Jimi Hendrix/ is fuckin' up the spangled banner
up into the sky/ Miles Davis blows a horn 
Look into the bleachers/ It's Bill Clinton sellin popcorn
so now we jump! and we have a celebration! 
Shaquille 0'neal would provide the entertainment
to some of you this is a far fetched scheme
but to me... I'll tell you what it is...
This is my Dream Team...

Spearhead,"(Money Money Money Money Nothin But 
Money)
I work 9 to 5 but it starts in the P.M.
and I love the sunrise so I step out in the A.M.
the street is black and shiny from the early
nightly rainin'
the glory of the light it brings evaporation 
morning's fresh oxygen cleanest
I take a deep hit help my mind stay the greenest
I'm already wake so I'm not drinkin' coffee
don't want to cigarrette, 'cause it's a form of slavery
walk into the store 'cause I need a few items
the sun heats the blood like a hit of vitamins
needa buy some food and some 'poo for my dreads
can't remember why but I need a spool of thread
Man with dirty dreads, steps around the comer
he asks me for a dime, a nickel or a quarter
I don't have any change so I'm steppin' along
and as I'm walkin' past he sings to me a song...

(chorus)
There's a whole in the bucket dear liza, dear
liza...(repeat)

The day is pickin' up cause I'm hummin' his song
the buses and the people all keep movin' along
to the shopkeeper I say ""was'sup?"" 
and I'm thinkin' about the man who's holdin' up the cup
I pay for all the stuff and get a pocketful of change
should I give it to the man's the question in my brain 
What's gonna happen if I give the man a dime?
I don't want to pay for anotha brotha's wine
What's gonna happen if I give the man a quarter?
will he find a dealer and try to place an order?
what's gonna happen if I give the man a nickel
will he buy some food or some pork that's been pickled? 
I'm not responsible for the man's depression
how can I find compassion in the midst of recession?
How come all these questions keep fuckin' with my head
and I still can't rememba why I need a spool of thread.

(chorus)

He's starin' in my eyes just as I'm walkin' past
I'm tryin to avoid him cause I know he's gonna ask 
me about the coinage that is in my pocket
But I don't know if I should put it in his bucket
walk right past him to think about it more 
back at the crib I'm openin' up the door
a pocketful of change it don't mean a lot to me
my cup is half full but his is empty 
I put back on my cap and I start headin' back
I reach into my pocket and I have a heart attack
well as I'm diggin' deep I scream ""oh no!"" 
there's nothin' in the pocket but a great big hole
While I was busy thinkin' if he would buy smack
the jingle in my pocket it slipped through the cracks 
no one has the change and it's fuckin' up my head
But now I no the reason why I had to buy the thread!

Spearhead,"If you are hungry I will 
bake some bread for you 
If you are worried I will 
hold your head for you 

If you can't sleep at night I will 
screen your dreams for you 

And if you feel uptight I will 
make everything alright for you.

Spearhead,"Say when you called me that night
to tell me that things
they weren't goin' alright with your boyfriend
was it me or did you just need somebody to talk to
Say is it you or the fact that I can't be near you
that keeps you in the front of my mind
when your breath is the last thing that you say
when your voice goes away                      
and a breath is the last thing that you say

But the warmth of your lips on my fingertips won't go away
when I drop my head in my hands and play
the memory of that might in L.A.
again and again and again
because I can't think straight and I can't sleep late
the few times we shared I try to recreate
I know this is wrong better stop this talk
cause grass can grow up through a crack in the sidewalk
and what I see when I look in your eyes
grass that's truly greenest sprouting inside
I wasn't even looking when I realized
that you had the vibe that was my fertilizer
thought love in this world was dead and buried and gone
how could I be so cynical when I was so young
you hit me in the chest like and 808 boom
I found love is the shit that makes life bloom!

(chorus)

Love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might step in it!
love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might...

But fate is like a pigeon that follows me around
sometimes he flies ahead and he brings me what he found
then he'll drop it on my head leave me numb
from the brain down
that's the way it was when I walked upon your ground

The irrepressible and impermissable
are the two things that have made my life miserable
'cause spirits don't leave if you don't talk about 'em
and memories come back when you don't think aabout 'em
I wish I had an ocean of some magic potion
I'd trade all this emotion for a few moments of motion
I've never felt this way some things can't be rehearsed
now I'm grindin' up my gearbox tryin' to find reverse
because...

(chorus)

(bridge)
But I want to keep on walkin'
Right through
And let this fellin' rock me
ooh-oooh!
(repeat)
""ya know fallin' in love is like easing into a hot tub.
it feels good on your feet but by the time you
get to your mid section you know your either
gonna get all the way in or all the way out!""

But music brings me comfort in this grieving hour
the Sade tape tells me it's all over for now
I listen read hard but don't dare play it loud
'cause I don't want to think what you might be doin' now
sometimes it feels like a bad initiation but you
woke my hear from a long hibernation
you were worth every risk so I gave my hear room
and now I'm deep in the doo-doo
that makes life bloom
because...

(chorus)

See the flowers bloomin' in the springtime
see the bees zoomin' in the sunshine
