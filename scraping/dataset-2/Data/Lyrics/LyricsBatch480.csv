John Harmon,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast",I Fall in Love Too Easily,2001
John Harmon,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1995
John Harmon,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,1995
John Harmon,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1995

John Harmon,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2006
John Harmon,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone In Love,2006
John Harmon,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2006
John Harrison III,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1995
John Harrison Trio,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me
For me",It's You or No One,2001
John Hart,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1991
John Hart,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same

John Hart,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1997
John Hart,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2001
John Hart,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2006
John Hartford,"One day about twenty-five years from now,
When we've all grown old from a-wondering how,
Oh we'll all sit down at the city dump,
And talk about the Goodle Days.
Oh you'll pass the joint and I'll pass the wine,
And anything good from a-down the line.
A lot of good things went down one time,
Back in the Goodle Days.

And the Good Old Days are past and gone.
A lot of good people have done gone on.
That's my life when I sing this song about
Back in the Goodle Days

Sometimes I get to thinkin' that we're almost done,
And there ain't nothin' left that we can figure out.
And I guess it must have seemed a lot more like that
Back in the Goodle Days,
But when ya gotta go, ya gotta go.
There's always somebody don'tcha know,
A-hangin' round a-sayin' ""Well I told you so"",
Back in the Goodle Days.

And the Good Old Days are past and gone.
A lot of good people have done gone on.
That's my life when I sing this song about
Back in the Goodle Days

Oh we'll all join hands and we'll gather round,
When that old guitar starts to make that sound.
A lot of good things went down downtown,
Back in the Goodle Days.
Squeezin' love with the people that we hadn't even met,
Out for anything that we could get.
Oh we did it then and we'll do it yet,
Back in the Goodle Days.

And the Good Old Days are past and gone.
A lot of good people have done gone on.
That's my life when I sing this song about
Back in the Goodle Days",Back in the Goodle Days,1971
John Hartford,"Well you asked was I holding
I said no I'm not holding
I thought you was holding, it's true
But here I'm not holding
And since you're not holding
My dear, what on Earth will we do 
Now you know when I'm holding
There's no need you holding
And you know the same about me
And if you run out
Before I run out
You can always get some from me

Now if you ain't got none
And if I ain't got none
We can go find some other head
Find out if they're holding
Get down and start rolling
And smoke what they're holding instead",Holding,1971
John Hartford,"Gonna pick up some of them empties here
Just as soon as we know where they lay
Tied off of them jolly and leavin' minds
On a long hot summer day
For every day I work on the Illinois river
I get a half a day off with pay
All day long I'm makin' up barges 
On a long hot summer day

Well I got me a gal in Pea-kin
She's a good ol' gal Okay
I bet she's sitting a winder fan
On a long hot summer day
For every day I work on the Illinois river
Get a half a day off with pay
All day long I'm makin' up barges
On a long hot summer day

Last night we had pork for supper
Today It'll be chicken consume`
And a fruit jar full of iced tea
On a long hot summer day
For every day I work on the Illinois river
Get a half a day off with pay
All day long I'm makin' up barges
On a long hot summer day

Well we put a man off in Beardstown
When we come down yesterday
I'm gonna off down at Alton
On a long hot summer day
For every day I work on the Illinois River
Get a half a day off with pay
All day long I'm makin' them barges 
On a long hot summer day

For every day I work on the Illinois River
Get a half a day off with pay
All day long I'm makin' them barges
On a long hot summer day

John Hartford,"False-Hearted Tenor
My False-Hearted Tenor, falsetto so high
I watch all your dobros as they slide on by.
My person is lonely I think it's because
My voice is not high and real thin like a saw
What would really be slick now if I learned how to sing
But they tell me to pick now 'cause that is my thing

It's genu-un-settle (wrong words) a voice without heart
I'm out in the meadow and I can't find my part
Just because I quit smoking and sit on a stool
and sing all them love songs like any dam fool
Remember the tenor when we render this waltz
I pick on a Fender in a tenor that's false

In my highest falsetto I can't sing this high
But I dam sure would like to and that's why I try
My voice is as much as two pitches too low
When I want to get high and get up like Munroe
But me no soprano without any pause
just a jug-throated croaker in a tenor that false

",The False Hearted Tenor Waltz,1976
John Hartford,"On Tombigbee river so bright I was born,
In a hut made ob husks ob de tall yaller corn,
An dar I fust meet wid my Jula so true
An I row'd her about In my Gum Tree Canoe

Chorus:
Singing row away row, O'er the waters so blue,
Like a feather we'll float, In my Gum Tree Canoe

All day in de field de soft cotton I hoe,
I tink of my Jula an sing as I go,
Oh I catch her a bird, wid a wing ob true blue,
An at night sail her round in my Gum Tree Canoe.
Singing row away

Chorus

Wid my hands on de banjo and toe on de oar,
I sing to de sound ob the rivers soft roar;
While de stars dey look down at my Jula so true,
An' dance in her eye in my Gum Tree Canoe.
Singing row away

Chorus
",Gum Tree Canoe,1982
John Hartford,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down
Spinning so fast, but for some it just ends
Keep moving on quiet as kept
It hasn’t been long, hasn’t sunken in yet

Then I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
Separate like a puzzle floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life
So lost

There’s so many things we haven’t said
There’s so many places never went
Wish you could visit every now and then
Oh I keep pretending like I understand
Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone
So lost

Cause I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
Never seeing you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life

So I rise and fall like the tide
And I’m so full and empty inside
All those memories linger in my mind
Wish you were here with me

I said I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life",Little Piece of My Heart,1987
John Hartford,"Oh we boarded the boat on the breast of the river so wide
And we left old St. Louis on the crest of that brown muddy tide
To the strains of the Delta Queen's band
I found myself holding your hand
The way we had hoped we would do all that summer and fall
Oh the whistle came out, such a deep mellow sound in the night
And the echo came back from the shoreline of twinkling lights
There was nothing we really could say
The river had swept us away
Like a present hereafter, the warm sound of laughter
As we danced to the Delta Queen Waltz

As the big wheel keeps rolling I find myself holding you near
With the night time unfolding I'm lucky just having you here
As a single wave curls down the shore, we're waltzing away cross the floor
As our heart beats assemble, the boat lightly trembles
As we dance to the Delta Queen Waltz

",Delta Queen Waltz,1989
John Hartford,"Come sit by my side little darlin' 
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will 
Never be nobody's darlin' but mine

Be nobody's darlin' but mine 
Love be honest be faithful be kind
And promise me that you will 
Never be nobody's darlin' but mine

You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebody's darlin'
Than a poor boy that nobody knows

Be nobody's darlin' but mine love",Nobody's Darling But Mine,1991
John Hartford,"The years creep slowly by, Lorena
The snow is on the grass a gain
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky

A hundred months have passed, Lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime

We loved each other then, Lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, Lorena
Had but our loving prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them, lost years, sleep on
Sleep on, nor heed life's pelting storms

The story of that past, Lorena
Alas I care not to repeat
The hopes that could not last, Lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause them one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, Lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
'Twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee

It matters little now, Lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future, o, thank God
Of life this is so small a part

But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart",Lorena,1991
John Hartford,"Okay I'm not done yet. I'll continue after work.  
It's knowing that your door is always open
And that you path is free to walk
That makes me tend leave my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind yer couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains dried upon some line
That keeps you in back roads by the rivers of my memory
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind

Not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns
Now that binds me
Or something that something that somebody said 
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad tracks and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my memory
For hours you're just gentle on my mind

All the wheat fields, and the clotheslines, and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother 
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurgling crackling cauldron in some train yard
My beard ruff and then a cold pile and a
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands, 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind,1993

    My walking shoes don't fit me anymore
    Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around

I bid farewell to old Kentucky, 
The place where I was born and raised

No pleasures here on earth I found 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now

Goin' back where I've already been

John Hartford,"Rows and flows of angel hair 
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way. 

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh but now old friends they're acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained 
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

John Hartford,"Just before our love got lost you said
I am as constant as a northern star"" and I said
Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter 
But you taste so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling 
Still be on my feet
i Still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time that you told me, you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter 
And you taste sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling 
Still I'd be on my feet
I still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said
Go to him
Stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed

Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine

John Hartford,"I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their T.V.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free",For Free,2016
John Hartford,"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The seagulls wheel, they turn and dive,
The mountain stands beside the sea.
This world we know turns round and round,
And all for them - and you and me.",The Water Is Wide,2016

It's terribly sad but true,

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

A comb in her long yellow hair
When who did she spy but Sweet William and his bride
As to the church yard they drew near

The day passed away and night coming on
Most of the men were asleep
Lady Margaret appeared all dressed in white
Standing at his bed feet

She said how do you like your bed
How do you like your sheet
How do you like your fair young bride
That's lying in your arms asleep

He said very well do I like my bed
Much better do I like my sheet
But most of all that fair young girl
That's standing at my bed feet

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Well the night passed away and the day came on
And into the morning light
Sweet William said I'm troubled in my head
By the dreams that I dreamed last night

Such dreams such dreams as these
I know they mean no good
For I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine
And my bride's bed full of blood

He asked is Lady Margaret in her room
Or is she out in the hall
But Lady Margaret lay in a cold black coffin
With her face turned to the wall

Throw back, throw back those snow white robes
Be they ever so fine
And let me kiss those cold corpsy lips
For I know they'll never kiss mine

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

If I was a mole in the ground

Don't marry a railroad man

John Hiatt,"I am the west wind.
I am the sea gull.
I dance on the waves,
As they break on the shore line. 

The moon is my sorrow.
The moon is my lantern.
I search for you so long,
These dark lonely beaches. 

Oh where can you be?
This restless sea,
These empty nights,
Have swallowed me. 

Look for something
Softer illusions
Soothe these vicious schemes.
There is the old one,
The wise one, the gold one. 
 
 I am the hunger,
The ache of the fiction,
And nestles in bones,
That he left for the vultures. 

Death is my secret,
A child my illusion,
And life is the suffering,
That brings men to (something?). 

Oh, where can you be?
This raging age,
This rotting life,
Is misery. 

Lost in your body,
Cave of you screeming,
Longing to be free.
Then you have broken,
The spine of your madness,
Come over here to me.",Ocean,1974

Holds her tired face up to the mirror. 
She sees a younger woman there she thought she would forget, 
And it hurts her now that no one comes to see her. 

She used to go to parties and a-dancing with her beau. 
Beneath the southern moon they found their places. 
But now she's tired all the time and she got no where to go, 
And the memories keep showing up in faces. 

So she finds her dressing table and she puts on all of her clothes, 
And she cries when she's realized she's just an old Rose. 

Rose walks to the kitchen then she fills her coffee cup. 
And thinks of how the mornings used to greet her. 
But now it's just another day and harder to get up, 
And it breaks her heart to think that no one needs her. 

And she wants to start all over but she ain't got far to go,

I've left so many times before.
That old north wind's a-blowin' circles round my feet.
What is this sorrow ever for?

I was a pigeon on the church.
She breathed pure golden as she hid from the procession.
I tumbled from my lowly perch.

When you acquire a vicious thirst.
Then love will cool your brow and soothe the apparition

Between the birthday and the death

Then she buttoned up her lip 
Went and hid in the oxygen tent 
Well the image shriveled up 
And the air got thin 
As she smiled from behind her mask

But it's gonna cost you your life 
If I was you, I would be leaving fast.""

And like a little girl 
She took off her wedding gown 
Then she stood before the mirror 
And it all came clear 
She was married to the lost and found

In her honeymoon

Strangers meet with blindfolds on and hope they're what they seem
And everybody wants to have each other

It's just the livin' that don't seem right

Your light sets me free, oh, please stay with me tonight

The soldier and his woman let the wounds heal
Knowing that tomorrow, all the raging will go on
If only to remember how their love feels

Better than a digital watch 
You got it, we're pros and we can spot it 
So I thought it was some disease 
But they were all on their knees 
Shakin' hands with my picture 
First we sterilize it 
Then we merchandise it 
Everybody tries 
Everybody buys it 
 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line 
 
They told me how to behave 
Like any other public slave 
Keep a smile on the face of the consumer 
Or you'll become a rumor 
So I got a band of angry sons 
Now we're havin' so much fun 
Tearin' up the nation 
Weapons out of mic stands 
Bitin' on the glad hand 
They still don't understand 
That they were marketing a madman 
 
And that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug- 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line 
 
You made one mistake 
You made me wait 
 
That's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug- 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Couldn't lay a glove on my mind 
So show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line",Slug Line,1979
John Hiatt,"You've been a good girl
You've been a bad girl
You're not a girl anymore
Deep in a picture show
Unbuttoned in the last row
You watched the grown-ups win the war
Now that they've got you where they want you
You're just combin' your hair
The alteration's done,but you're havin' way too much fun
They want to touch you but you just don't care

Take off your uniform
They see what they want to see
You should have never been born
You'd better stay with me

Your replacement
Waits in the basement
They've got her down to your smile
She writes those letters too
She thinks she's better than you
She says you're just a foolish child
They got her smilin' while she's dialing

She's such a clever machine
She'd fit in anywhere, now that her vision's impaired
She listens up, but she don't know what they mean

Take off your uniform
They see what they want to see
You should have never been born
You'd better stay with me

Everyone's happy with your daily activities
They like that tone in your voice
Now that you're finally an adult in America
You're too dumb to have a choice

Shine it on me, shine it on me

But if you're on the brink of the usual stuff 
Wait 'til it rains and give it away 
 
Little girl, they just want to train you 
To keep them amused, to keep them amused 
They don't know, you got your match to the end of that fuse

I saw you on the Mickey Mouse Club 
I see your wife has a trash compactor 
I see you holdin' two ticket stubs 
 
I see you pushin' out your politics 
I see you rifling the machine 
I see you dressin' up your party chicks 
Lipstick like convertible scenes 
 
I didn't think that you were so much better 
You just predicted all the fate in the world 
But now you're sitting home knitting sweaters 
Tellin' stories to a three year old 
 
Ya used ta kiss the girls and make 'em cry 
Ya used ta be too young to die 
Ya used ta kiss the girls and make 'em cry 
Ya used ta kiss the girls, ya used to kiss the girls 
 
Now you've got one wife, two kids, three cars, 
Four eyes, five suits, six mortage, seven midnight deals 
Lotsa time lotsa cash, feed your son take out the trash 
Do what you're told, you're gettin' old, we did not think you'd last 
 
She only told you that the party was over 
She didn't tell you that the bedroom was locked 
And when she took your key and started up your motor 
You should have taken that spin around the block

John Hiatt,"I get jumpy
Want to step on the gas
Drive right out of
This place fast
She says, ""Red light,
I'll take those keys.""
Out of my mind and
On my knees

[Chorus:]
Something happens
And I don't know why
I can't seem to get my future
Out of her eyes
Something happens
And never for sure
If I could name this sickness
I'd be cured
I'd be cured

She's long distance
And it's a grind
Always static
On that line
Tear the phone out
From the wall
But in my head I
Get that call

[Chorus]

She don't want to talk
She don't want to talk to me
She just want to look
She just want to look through me

It's a famine
Or it's a feast
Who's that beauty?
Who's that beast
Threatening murder
Or happiness?
And if I do it
Will I confess?

[Chorus]",Something Happens,1982
John Hiatt,"I dreamed I was being kept alive
To bear the brunt of a family joke
About which no one spoke 
To multiply and divide
This hideous thing, this human kind
With something else on his mind 
I was going to bed
You were saying, ""I do""
Then I lost my head 

[Chorus:]
When I awoke
I was living this secret life
Complete with a secret dog
And a secret wife
In another zone
Address unknown
This secret life
This secret life 
And I am chilled to be here
Among these ghosts so heaven-bent
With hell to pay for rent 
When I am holding you near
I'm not so sure this world is real
I'm not sure how I feel 
And I was going to say
""Not a whisper, dear""
Then I drifted away 

[Chorus:]
 
Come out, come out
Wherever you are
You look so near
You seem so far
This scale's messed up
The angle's wrong
Your day will come
Meanwhile, the night is long 

[Chorus:]",This Secret Life,1982
John Hiatt,"It's that mechanical motion
Skin-tight when the nights are bloodless
Lip-sync the latest notion
From zombie drill instructors 

Throw out of all the parties
Maybe it's time for me to bed
Now his eyeball's runnin'
Just like a razor down her leg 

[Chorus:]
Baby's joined the walking dead
Up from her grave
Another white slave
Nothin' goes in or out of her head
Never you mind
Tryin' to find
A real live girl in your bed
She's joined the walking dead 

She likes this frenzy feeding
She cuts across the dance floor
Thinks she's the only one bleeding
He cuts his teeth on girls like her 

Just a little more makeup
Till she makes up for being used
He hardly knows what he's saying
She hardly knows how to refuse 

[Chorus]

She's walking 
With his eyes in your head
With his tongue in your bed
And your lips are swollen red
From the kiss of the walking dead 

[Chorus]",The Walking Dead,1982
John Hiatt,"I heard the news from every fool in town
You got somebody new
And I never hurt so bad
The strangest fiction just came true

Crowds will gather for a twisted wreck
Well, all right stare at me
Its just another story of love
That's turned into tragedy

What am I supposed to do
You want a toast from the man who's lost
The man who's double crossed
From cover to cover
Baby you and me were just book lovers

Since you turned away I turned the page on my happiness
Once upon a time you were mine, now I must confess
I can't bear to read the rest

It could have been a happy ending girl
Goodness knows, I tried
But I see so clearly now
Even through these tears I've cried

You wanted love to be a fairly tale
With a sleeping beauty scene
Now another prince has come
And kissed you out of all your dreams",Book Lovers,1983
John Hiatt,"Well Harry had a good job 
Working for the Secret Service
He had a wife and kids at home 
Who made him awful nervous
He'd never done a damn thing 
You could call experimental
And he had this aching feeling 
That his life was accidental

So one day he burned his pinstripe suit
And his leather shoulder-holster
He snapped a Polaroid 
And made a giant Wanted poster
He took it to a print shop 
And ordered up a thousand fliers
And walked next door to the laundromat
And blew his brains out in the dryer

And the tag on his toe read 
Death by misadventure
Ain't that some way to go 
Death by misadventure

Well Harry's wife Estella 
Took this matter very lightly
She could have cried and cried
But then her looks might come unsightly
She thought about her wardrobe
And how much it was out-dated
And how this trumped-up family thing
Was vastly over-rated

Her kids both turned against her
And they took to drugs and stealing
Some junkie killed 'em both
For two dime-bags they were dealing
And sitting home alone
Disgusted by it all
She blew the sole survivor off
With ninety Nembutals

And the tag on her toe read
Death by misadventure
Ain't that some way to go
Death by misadventure

So be careful how you choose your path
And who you pick to go with
Some folks they take to living fast
While some prefer a slow death
Some folks get confused
And never quite know how they're going
When you're laid out on that slab
We're all the worse for knowing

That the tag on your toe reads
Death by misadventure
What a silly way to go
Death by misadventure",Death by Misadventure,1983
John Hiatt,"I'm gonna lower my standards and raise my price
I'm gonna take your lunch and your bad advice
Until my worse idea gets the big reward
Until I get out of this raggedy Ford
And into a shiny new two seater
Dress my girlfriend up like a cheetah 
I'm gonna sign my checks: Yours sincerely
For all the money that you hold dearly
When my ego swells and my output dwindles
You can tell the world that you've been swindled
By the man who would have been so bitter
Had he never reconsidered 
Falling up
To the top of the junk pile wearing a big smile
Falling up
To the top of the heap with my tongue in cheek
I can't sit down cause I'm falling up 
Well I used to think that I had some duty
Now I only want the booty
And unless you've recently been anointed
Then don't tell me you're disappointed
In the man who would have been so bitter
Had he never reconsidered 
Now I pay no mind to innovation
Just over and over with the same sensation
Till I'm a short short subject on a long tape loop
That comes and goes like the hula hoop 
In one ear and out the other
Nothing there to stop it, brother 
Falling up",Falling Up,1983
John Hiatt,"Well he's got her going up and down like a yo-yo
And she never feels better than ever, just so-so
Like a shrunken head on a rear view mirror
She rides along in his atmosphere
Like furry dice or some voodoo thing
he's got that girl on a string 
Since they tied the knot he keeps her in stitches
And when she ain't banged up, she's sewing his britches
Like a line between the orange juice cans
she's strung out on his childish demands
To meet him out by the backyard swing
he's got that girl on a string 
Girl on a string, just a little play toy
Girl on a string, for a little bad boy
Girl on a string, he's dragging her around
Girl on a string, he's tying her down 
She carries his baby straddled on her hipbone
And there's another on the way, just wait till they get home
The deeper into darkness they get
The more she sees the silhouette
Of a girl who wanted pretty things
Not that girl on a string",Girl on a String,1983
John Hiatt,"Take it easy baby
But take as much as you can
Cause I got all the sweet loving
You could possibly stand
I'll take your tears for drinking water
Make your pain sweet company
You can lay all your burdens on my shoulder
Girl you mean that much to me 

[CHORUS 1:]
I could climb the highest mountain
To show the world I could survive
But without your lovin' baby
I wouldn't even be alive
Cause your love is like blood
Cause your love is like blood to me 
Like a river baby
Your love is running through me
And with ev'ry beat of our hearts
We're defying gravity
Just a little bit further on up the stream
There's a shady resting place
Where you can lose all your blues and your troubles
With just one sweet embrace 

[CHORUS 2:]

Now I could do a million things
Just to prove that I'm a man
But there's only one woman
Who holds my life in her hands
Your love is like blood to me
Your love it's just like blood to me 
I don't care what your people say
Over my dead body will they ever take you away
And any man cutting in on me
Well he just better stop cause I can't spare a drop
Your love is like blood to me 
Your love is like blood to me",Love Like Blood,1983
John Hiatt,"Who'll take the only hearts they got
And throw them into the fire?
Who'll risk their own self-respect
In the name of desire?
Who'll regret every thing they've done
And who'll get the bill?
Lovers will 
Who'll hurt each other all the time
And never give it a though?
Who'll like about where they've been
And hope they never get caught?
Who'll say each other's kisses
No longer thrill?
Lovers will 
Lovers will do almost anything
For the thrill that only love can bring
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?
Lovers will 
Who'll never know what they've got
Until its just about gone?
And whose arms will gather up what's left
To carry on?
And who'll stalk that little bit of love
That hasn't been killed?
Lovers will",Lovers Will,1983
John Hiatt,"Dry your eyes pretty girl
I just got news from the outside world
I don't know how they got our names
But yesterday this letter came
Mr. and Mrs. Resident Dweller, your lucky number is

You may already be a winner 
I've suspected this for years
Still in all its good to hear
They're pulling for us in the post
To you my dear, I raise this toast 

A house of our dreams, an El Dorado, a ten-speed blender
You may already be a winner 
Now I've never counted my chickens before they're hatched
And I know there is always a catch
But I've felt from the start that our hearts were the perfect match 

I know you're tired of the same old dress
I know the car's been repossessed
I know this house is just a shack

I said, ""I've got the wrong number,"" and I slammed the phone down 
Thought about it for a minute 'til the anger went away
I figure every dog in town is gonna have his day
Well, I could count the teardrops, or I could wonder why

It was champagne parties and sweet love sins
Now it's warm beer at midnight and girlie magazines
I stack the empty cans up like a freshman in school

Got my socks in the oven, something's growing in the sink
I can't begin to face the day without a couple of drinks
Ain't had a decent meal since you made me cry

John Hiatt,"Well the Ace of Spades, walkin' on the water
The joker's only daughter, in love with the king of hearts
Ooooh and the Jack of Clubs is kissing the Queen of Diamonds
Oh, she's such a shy one, until that dancing starts 

[Chorus:]
It's a house of cards
I guess it can blow too hard and the aces all fall down
But there's no one to blame
In the number one honest game
Playin' the number one honest game 

You got deuces wild, go find yourself a partner
Tell her that you love her, before she checks your bet
Seven's up try again tomorrow, it's only a life of sorrow
This love you can't forget

Girl, my heart's not rigged nor gone astray
I'm lookin' for that timeless game to play
The way you move fills me with desire
But if you play with me, girl, you're playin' with fire, I'm burnin' up 

Count your suits, add up all your markers
Now that you have found her, you take the love you want
Ooooh, you want mine, I'd give you kind and gentle
Just forget the mental, you put your heart in front

John Hiatt,"Could have been the kiss of my life
Could have been the death of me
Could have been that I was just too scared
To wait around and see 

You could have been a guardian angle
I could have been the wicked one
Besides the buttons on our shirts, girl,
What else did we leave undone?
When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
Was it just the time slippin' through our hands?
Right through our hands 

Maybe I was tryin' to tell ya
I'd never known a love so strong
Maybe in the shadows of the night
We just couldn't tell right from wrong
Maybe its a real-life story
Livin' with the sad regrets
Maybe it was just a sweet dream baby
Somethin' that I can't forget
When we ran
when we ran
when we ran
Was it just the time slippin' through our hands? 

You only had to say the word
I would have turned around and heard
But as it is we can't turn back
The mind's just a trash can, baby
And the memories, rolling dice
We had something one time, girl,
But we thought about it twice

When we ran
We ran
we ran
we ran

John Hiatt,"I'm 34 years old now
And I've come to you
Baby I don't even know how
I got through 

From the first kiss in the schoolyard
Til the last heart broke in two
I didn't know it would be so hard
Learning how to love you
There was a life that I was living
In some cracked rearview
Where no future was given
To a heart untrue 

Still I thought that I was so strong
That my will could force me through
I didn't know it would be so long
Learning how to love you 

I might have never realized
The courage in your kiss
And the sweet forgiveness in your eyes 

Babe I know you've walked a mile
In someone else's shoes
Maybe you've left some faces smiling
Walking off your blues 

And I don't pretend to know how
You ever saw it through
'Cause I only got to where I am now

John Hiatt,"There's a lipstick sunset
Smeared across the August sky
There's a bitter sweet perfume
Hanging in the fields
The creek is running high 

And I left my lover waiting
In the dawn somewhere to wonder why
By the end of the day
All her sweet dreams would fade
To a lipstick sunset 

Well, a radio was playing
And that ol' summer heat was on the rise
I just had to get away
Before some sad old song
Brought tears to my eyes 

And Lord I couldn't tell her
That her love was only killing me
By the end of the day
All her sweet dreams would fade
To a lipstick sunset 

Well it's pretty as a picture baby
Red and blushing just before the night
Maybe love's like that for me
Maybe I can only see
As you take away the light 

So hold me in the darkness
We can dream about the cool twilight
'Til the dawning of the day
When I make my getaway
To a lipstick sunset 

There will come another day

To a lipstick sunset 

There will come another day

You might not like my style

Just a little too long a while 

You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode 

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I want to trade in these ol country boots
For some fine italian shoes 

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat 

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous 

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone

John Hiatt,"I stood up for the first time
When I was just eleven months old
And ever since that day, my mama said
I never done what I was told 

I never stood for nothing too much 
All through my schooling years
But I stood as much as I could stand
I guess that's why I'm still standing here
Yes, and...

[Chorus:]
I stood up
When love called my name, baby
I stood up 
Even when that love was all in vain, baby
I got stood up once
And left out in the pouring rain, baby
But I stood up
And I'd do it again 

I guess she never understood what she could do
With all her flaming red hair
But I could not stand the heat in her kitchen
So, Jack, I got out of there 

I stood up to get a pack of cigarettes
Down at the corner store
Now she's standing in some corner of my heart
Behind the kitchen screen door 

[Chorus]

I don't know about you
But there's a lot of things I never stood up to
Even as I turned and walked away
I guess that's why I'm standing on my own
Two feet today 

Now they gave last call for alcohol
And no one has to carry me home
You see, I only work here now, man
My drinking days are long gone 

I couldn't stand up after one, no

Like a couple of thieves
Now we're rolling in clover, babe
We didn't read this in no tea leaves 

My fate was sealed before I met you, darling
I was halfway down a shallow grave
So little room for you to catch me falling
Still, you took the little love I saved 

I want to thank you, girl

It's a matter of opinion
But I think you're fine

Is the only thing standin'
Between our lives
And the speed of sound

And a love that they killed

And I couldn't see the damage I'd done

All come down to a slip of the tongue

Well, I'd take it back
But time won't let me

As your daughter dumps her oatmeal on your son
And you keep it hid
Just like your did 

So you go to work just to watch some jerk
Pick up the perks
You were in line to get
And the guy that hired you just got fired
Your job's expired

So you go and buy a brand new set of wheels
To show your family just how great you feel
Acting like a kid
Just like your dad did

You're a chip off the old block
Why does it come as such a shock
That every road up which you rock

Yeah, you've seen the old man's ghost
Come back as creamed chipped beef on toast
Now, if you don't get your slice of the roast
You're gonna flip your lid

But something's taking place
Yeah, the food is cold and your wife feels old

Should I start? 
To turn what's been frozen for years 
Into a river of tears 

""These days we all play cool, calm and collected 
Why, our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze"" 
But under the frost, well, he thought he detected 
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knee 

He said, ""Girl, you're a beauty like I've never witnessed 
And I've seen the Northern Lights dance in the air 
But I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss 
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there.""

I'm feeling alone and it just don't seem right
Is anybody there?

Well you must have felt like this
That a man might come along
With another hard luck song
And betray you with a kiss 

But would you reconsider me
Though I know I've caused you pain
I've taken vows with you
I believe them to be true
Now can we take a little rain?

You ask how we got here baby don't ask how

When I give my love to you
And it's shot back like an arrow
So straight and true

And maybe tomorrow we can't take it

With this love of ours somehow

A little bit of fear, you know it goes a long way
It's followed us around since we were little kids
With just a little faith, well maybe baby someday
We will find the strength, the strength to forgive

It don't come all of a sudden
But when it comes at last
You could blink your eyes and miss it
It happens so fast

She rang those words out with all she got 
With a baby and the laundry in the Chevrolet
Well, he thought about following anyway 
But he drove 'em to the strip mall laundromat
In his three-day beard and his red man hat 
Trudy washed their bell bottom jeans
While that baby just sat there lookin' mean 

Trudy and Dave 
They're out of their minds 
Trudy and Dave 
They're out of their minds 

Well, David put a match to a Lucky Strike 
And the smoke curled up 'round his head how he liked
It made him feel a little mysterious 
Till Trudy said ""David, honey, what about us?""
So he thought about them and those shots ringing out 
And other things he shouldn't be thinking about 
Like how it wasn't them at all, just life that was mean 
And how a twenty dollar pistol made him feel so clean

They're out of their minds

They're out of their minds 

Didn't mean to do it, baby, but I did it for love 
The same shot his daddy heard before him 
A shot that can really blow you away 
And when it is fired, his mama told him 
""David, you'll follow it to your grave."" 

Well, Trudy and Dave, those crazy kids 
Had a baby of their own, and you heard what they did 
In the middle of a strip mall shots rang out 
Shots heard all over the world, no doubt

Cause there were no words to define
The ball of confusion, of feelings and stuff
That I kept in the back of my mind 

So I took to the highway
And I kept to myself
Just a lookin' and hopin' to find
Some solutions, some answers, someway to exist
All this stuff in the back of my mind 

So I took me a job
And I took me a wife
And I took me a bottle of wine
And it did not take long, 'til all I had left
Was this junk in the back of my mind 

Well the end of the tunnel
It never came up
'til I came to the end of the line
And I saw that the light I'd been hoping to see
Was just a spark in the back of my mind 

And the cold wind that blew
Through the hole in my heart
Made a fire for the very first time
From some branches of trust
And a kindling of faith

They say pride will be our downfall
Girl I've swallowed mine
I'm begging you, baby, come back
And I will tow the line
To the top of the Eiffel Tower
To the bottom of the sea
If it means just one more hour
Your love will shine on me 

Our love is worth fighting for
And you know it, even as you close that door

Bright it right back here baby
Bring back, bring back your lovin' to me
I want you sweet lovin' right now",Bring Back Your Love to Me,1990
John Hiatt,"They have come to haunt the children
They have come to walk the wind
I can hear them as they rustle through the trees
Looking for the love that killed them
So that they might live again
It's a simple prayer that brings me to my knees

With drums and bells and rattles
They have caught us in our time
To watch the eagle rise up from the fire
Now is it true we are possessed
By all the ones we leave behind
Or is it by their lives we are inspired

[Chorus]
It's a new light, new day
Listening for new meaning learning how to say
It's a new place but you've always been here
You're just listening to old voices with a new ear

It's the livin' and the dyin'
Well it scares the young ones so
They can hardly catch their breath before too long
They see the tears we're crying
And they watch the river flow
And they follow on the banks until it's gone

I surrender to the mountains
I surrender to the sea
I surrender to the one who calls my name
I surrender to my lover and to my enemy
I surrender to the face that holds no shame

[Chorus]

There's a spider at my window
And she spins a web of truth
More beautiful than all those memories
And she surely is God's artist
As she's caught the morning dew
It's a simple prayer that brings me to my knees

[Chorus: x2]",Listening to Old Voices,1990
John Hiatt,"You look just like Mona Lisa, baby
Have you got something up your sleeve?
You got your arms folded and your legs propped up
Oh, I must say, you're looking relieved 

Was there some tension eased up on us, baby?
Like two plates shifting on a fault?
They sold Van Gogh's Sunflowers the other day
Some guy stuck 40 million in a bank vault! 

[CHORUS:]
One kiss and we're on our own
One kiss it can mean so much
One kiss and we're almost home
One kiss that's the final touch 

They shot that Galileo off to Jupiter
We'll have some pictures in about six years
Gonna stomp anything the Voyager sent back
Cause Galileo dreamed it, it's here 

Now Ralph Kramden never sent Alice to the moon
But you know he wanted to
But having a good friend like Norton to ease the pressure
Can really work wonders on a fella's point of view 

[CHORUS:]
Oh it's bringing me to my knees
They lost all those kinescopes
All of those memories
Doing the cool jerk together 

Let's outlive our usefulness, baby
Let's stay in our own skin too long
Till we're so wrinkled all the hatchlings just laugh at us
As they crack out of their eggshells at the break of dawn 

We'll say",One Kiss,1990
John Hiatt,"Well now I never went to college, babe, 
I did not have the luck.
Stole out of Indiana 
On the back of a pickup truck.
No education higher,
Than the streets of my hometown.
I went looking for a fire just to burn it all down.

[Chorus]
You got a real fine love,
You got a real fine love,
One I am unworthy of.
You got a real fine love, girl.

Thought I had a line of something, 
Baby no one else could say,
They couldn't find it their hearts to just get out my way.
And out of nowhere, and for nothing, 
You came into my life,
I've seen an angel or two before, 
But I never asked one to be my wife.

[Chorus]

You can sprinkle all your teardrops
Across the evening sky,
But you cannot hide that twinkle,
Starlight in your eye.
I left my map way back their baby,
I don't know where we are.
But I'm gunna pull my pony up, 
Hitch my wagon to your star.

[Chorus]

Well now the babies are sleeping,
And the twilight's giving in,
She looks like you,
He looks like her,
And we all look like him.
Well maybe it's just a little thing,
The way I feel tonight,
A little joy, a little love, and a whole lot of light.

John Hiatt,"You were a tiny spark
Caught in your parents' eyes
When they made love in the dark
You were the big surprise
And the old man came through
Gave his very best for you
And your mother's arms
They kept you warm
Like no other arms could do

When you couldn't find the light
At the top of the stairs
When you cried in the night
Well, you knew they were there
Will the light of the day
Was as bright as it seemed
And you knew in your heart
You were livin' the rest of the dream

Well, I had a dream of you
But I never realized
Baby, the dream was true
That's when you opened my eyes

And I will come through
Do my very best for you
And your lovin' arms
Gonna keep me warm
Like no other arms will do

Now I see a tiny spark
Caught in your lovin' eyes
As we make love in the dark
And wait for the big surprise

And your mama's arms
Gonna keep you warm

With the dew rag on
And the cowboy tie
Man that cat is gone

Then way out west
Put that Hollywood party
To the acid test

In the valley somewhere
Took a gig playing bass
With Sonny and Cher

And never got it off his chest

What it was not
Or what it was all about 

He got all tangled up with liquor and drugs
Trying to make a racket

And he couldn't see straight
He couldn't even shine shoes

John Hiatt,"There were seven little Indians
Living in a brick house on
Central Avenue
Gathered 'round their daddy
Tellin' stories in the living room
From a slightly unrealistic point of view
Momma was off yonder in the kitchen somewhere
Boiling up some hot water for them to all get up to their necks in
The seven little Indians new
If the rest of the tribe ever scrutinized their household
Somehow it would not pass inspection
The big chief railed on
And spun his tales of brave conquest
About the moving of his little band
Up to Alaska
Where the caribou run free
See he had been there putting in telephone lines
For the army during World War II
Even brought back a picture of a frozen mastodon
For the little Indians to see
And some mukluks and some sealskin gloves
And a coat with beads around the collar
His wife kept them in the mothballs
Underneath the Hudson Bays
And every once and a while he'd get all wound up
With one of his stories, he'd put them all on
And dance around in that blue TV light
Like it was some campfire blazing away
Well he stamped and he hollered
But he could not stay warm in that living room
And even the seven little Indians could feel the chill
And although everything always worked
Out for the better in all of his stories
In that old brick house it always felt like
Something was movin' in for the kill
Blazing like a trail
Shot through the eyes of the seven little Indians
Blazing like the sheets of light dancing up in the sky
Up above Anchorage
Blazing like a star shot down to the ground
Back home again in Indiana
Now it finally got so quiet you could hear a pin drop
They started dropping like flies

Ya, that's the way the wind blows
These days the only bar I ever see
Has got lettuce and tomatoes

I get pumped up in the back of my mind
Start thinking those days were the best of times
But I never look forward to looking back
Now I see a little daylight coming through the cracks

You steal enough it feels like we're stopping time

Cause they told you like ivy, you were born to crawl
But you kept looking up, girl, and I know why
Cause you knew some day you were gonna touch the sky

John Hiatt,"You were dreaming on a park bench
'Bout a broad highway somewhere
When the music from the carillon
Seemed to hurl your heart out there
Past the scientific darkness
Past the fireflies that float
To an angel bending down
To wrap you in her warmest coat 

[CHORUS:]
And you ask, ""What am I not doing?""
She says ""Your voice cannot command.
In time, you will move mountains,
And it will come through your hands."" 
Still you argue for an option
Still you angle for your case
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush
If it blew up in your face
Yeah, we scheme about the future
And we dream about the past
When just a simple reaching out
Might build a bridge that lasts

So whatever your hands find to do
You must do with all your heart
There are thoughts enough
To blow men's minds and tear great worlds apart 
There's a healing touch to find you
On that broad highway somewhere
To lift you high
As music flying
Through the angel's hair.

And it will come through your hands",Through Your Hands,1990

Seems to me that's all you've ever known
Desperately looking for something that's real
Hard to find is the love that can heal
Baby dry the tears from your eyes
And take my hand as we walk into the night
Tender are the dreams
That we try so hard to hide, so deep inside

And it's just across the borderline

You may lose more than you'll ever hope to find.

And when you reach that broken promised land
And all your dreams slip though your hand
You have learned it's too late to change your mind
Cause you pay the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline.

Reveal a secret no one can define

In between our life and death
Tell me who is next to cross that borderline.

And you give me some
Of your sweet mystery

And it feels so real
And it feels so right
And I want your love
Forever

Baby when you hold me tight
We can count heartbeats and squeeze
Baby when you hold me tight
You can really make a man say please

Baby when you hold me tight
We can count heartbeats and squeeze
Baby when you hold me tight
You can really make a man say please",When You Hold Me Tight,1993
John Hiatt,"Saturday night he comes home stinking
Sunday morning she wakes up thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking
Does she need to get the kids dressed to go to church
He's pulled a shotgun out of the lurch

He heads for the tv room starts to search
His problems swollen like a river and his reality's shrinking
He finds them huddled by the toy box and splatters 'em all
The ken and the midge and the skipper doll
They look like a family but they're really not at all

Well he's sad but he ain't sorry
It ain't the end of the world
It's just the wreck of the barbie ferrari

He wonders if he ever said i do
To that little blonde plastic voodoo
And his mind's gone fishin'
Well it started just as plain as the nose on your face

Now it's in a thousand peices all over the place
He thought she was driving but it's twisted beyond recognition
All the diapers and the tutus and the basketballs
She was givin' them a lift to the promised mall

But somewhere by the tv that v-12 stalled
As he loaded the chamber her eyes got starry
It ain't the end of the world
It's just wreck of the Barbie Ferrari

When they get home from church won't they be sorry
He's cornered 'em all on his urban safari

It ain't the end of the world...
He's played with cars and guns since he could crawl
Now he wishes he'd never met that doll with her face gone
There wasn't nothing he ever thought about

He couldn't drive through or shoot his way out
As he surveys the family room littered with dolls
He can't find one leg to stand on
He aims the gun at his head now he's starting to cry

Looking for the courage to let it fly
Can't live without his family now that something has died
He's not sure who's hurt not sure who's sorry

It ain't the end of the world...",The Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari,1993

Of an empty glass
It's a still life study
Of a drunken ass
And he howls at the moon
Hoping the sun don't come up too fast

I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone on my knees at last
Alone in the dark

It's extreme self pity
And frozen fear
'cause I want you with me
And you're not here
So I rub my nose in it babe
Til the roses smell just like death

I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone and drawing whiskey breath

Just turned around one day and you were gone

John Hiatt,"I've been taking off and landing but this airport's closed
And how much thicker this fog is gonna get god only knows
Just when you think that you've got a grip
Reality sneaks off it gives you the slip
As if you ever knew what it was taking you down the line 

[Chorus]
Tearing through the cottonfields and bus shelters
Of the south running helter skelter
Down through the mississippI delta
With no place to call your own
Mixing up drinks with mixed feelings
All along the paint was peeling
Down to an indian blanket on a pony
With no rider in the flesh and bone
Looking for his buffalo river home 

I've been circling the wagons down at times square
Trying to fill up this hole in my soul but nothing fits there
Hust when you think you can let it rip
You're pounding the pavement in your daddy's wingtips
As if you had some place better to go
Or a better way to get there 

[Chorus]

Now there's only two things in life but I forget what they are
It seems we're either hanging on a moonbeams coat tails
Or wishing on stars

And you run off and join the circus
Yeah, you just let that pony ride",Buffalo River Home,1994
John Hiatt,"A moment of steel, a dry eyed house
Did he say goodbye to you, or did you kick him out
I know you're not afraid to go alone

What you gonna do, gonna slit your wrists
Bleed all over the milky way
The stars in your eyes look red today

[Chorus]
Cry love, cry love
The tears of an angel 
The tears of a dove
Spilling all over
Your heart from above
Cry love, cry love

The trust of a woman in his hand
But he was a little boy, not a man
You loved him stronger than he could feel
But he was wrapped up in himself like an orange peel
Now what you gonna do with the bruise and the blush
What you gonna do when there's no rush
Cop a little misery at the corner store
Well one day that train of pain won't stop no more

John Hiatt,"Could not get to sleep
It was on my wedding night
I was tangled in the sheets
And I was dreaming of a light
Pouring from her window
Coming up through the floor
Lifting up the darkness
Crashing through my kitchen door

Down to that old oak table
I went to take a look
And my whole life flashed before me
Just like a story book
She used to make me breakfast
Or sit around and talk
Have another cup of coffee
Or maybe take a little walk

[Chorus]
Dust down a country road
Blowing int he wind
Behind an old truck load
Up before the rooster crowed
There's an old dog staring

At the dust down a country road
And that truck is going somewhere
I just can't be sure
When tomorrow's just the day
After all that's gone before
And I always thought of leaving
I never could stay too long
Now her memory's catching up
And our sweet dreams are all gone

[Chorus]

If I had a bullet I'd put it in this gun
And I'd catch that old dog napping
And I'd shoot him before he runs
Cause he ain't much good for nothin'
Except staring at the dust
Lord I wonder what he's looking at
Sneaking up on us

Wondering  what you are up to 
This hotel's got bathroom telephones

Each one a different color
Or listening to that  Beach Boys sailing song
Sloop John B. or another

My love for you is just obscene
My deer you dress
My fish you clean
But you are nowhere to be seen

Now you could bag your limit with a bow and arrow
Yeah you could skin a cougar in the dark
Well I thought we were walking down the straight and narrow
How'd we ever drift so far apart
I put eighteen wheels on this road to nowhere
And you disappeared right up in the hills
Like smoke up a chimney girl I go there 
Yeah in my dreams I visit you still

[Chorus]

Now some men will drive to the edges of nothing 
So they can take a peek at the great abyss
Some men avoid love like it was a plague or something
So they can leave the seat down when they piss
I miss that crocheted thing you kept on the kleenex box
I miss my  feet on your cold linoleum floor
Sipping hot coffee after making love til daybreak

Before she was fourteen
But there was an emptiness there

About as big as daddy 10.000 acre farm

Oh, she was dying for it
For all the world to see
Ah, she was as good as she could be

Well she had a baby at eighteen
Never finished high school
Her husband beat her for money and sex
Till that Cadillac finally ran out of fuel
One disaster led to another

Down to her and her baby son
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Headed south now
Cause she was never born to run

Well her momma died last year
And her daddy he called her back home
But when he opened the door
He could not recognize
This specter of hair and bone
But it was his own baby child
Though she looked like an old woman now
Well she lived ten lifetimes in five years

I'm talking to walls in my hotel room
Around the world in a sonic boom

Some close calls and some near misses
All I want is your sweet soul kisses

Little children playing at my feet
Well I would give my soul to be
Back in your arms in Tennessee

While they're cutting deals with grim reapers
Tell me, where'd you get those peepers 

Well I filling out all the pages of this questionaire
But I left out all the details of this affair
They'll never get it down on the books
So they'll never know how much it took 

[Chorus]",My Edge of the Razor,1996
John Hiatt,"We've talked it to death, cryin' on the telephone.
Nights when he drinks at home, she has to whisper throught her tears.
""Johnny,"" she says, ""you'd never do these things to me.""
But I can never make her see he's wasted such precious years.
Well, ""you married the wrong guy"" is all I ever say. 

[Chorus]
He's a no good so and so, but she'll never let him go
Though she knows it will never work, she loves the jerk.
She loves the jerk. 

He was the guy always out on the make.
I guess he had what it takes to turn the heads of pretty girls.
She thought he would change; the worst of us will settle down.
But he couldn't stay out of town, not even with this precious pearl
Now she lives with the lies and the bumps and the bruises. 

[Chorus]
 
Well, I hang up the phone and I pretend she's in my arms.
What I wouldn't give for just one-tenth of what she gives Mister Charming.

He's a no good so and so, but she'll never let him go.
Though she knows it will never work, she loves the jerk",She Loves the Jerk,1996
John Hiatt,"Why did she wear that dress tonight
Why did she bring that stranger
She looks put out in the party lights
Which leaves us all in danger
When she drops her perfumed hankie 

[Chorus]
I look for love
I look for love
I look for love
I look for love 

I hate the way we carry on
These fashion consultations
Do all these wires we sing along
Require such insulation
Fused with fear or charged with anger 

[Chorus]
 
No innocence I can claim
No treasure of stolen hearts
In every mirror I look the same
A toy soldier with missing parts
she's adding up those second looks
While she collects advances
Like thumbing through some dirty book
They estimate their chances
When the parking lot is empty

I thought I knew you like the back of my hand
Pick him up, he's just a ghost from the old days
That's just about as far as we go from here
That's just about as far as we go

He wants a ride out of Montana
Back to the girl with the west in her eyes
Before the wagons rolled out of Indiana
That's just about as far as we go from here
That's just about as far as we go
That's just about as far as we go from here

And you and I know
That this road don't go back there anymore
Just let him rest
He's the best of you and me
Just let him be

And who'd have thought we'd be haunted by dreams
Dreams of love so true and everlasting

John Hiatt,"She was a woman sawed in half
It was done by a bad magician
There was a point at which she just had to laugh
You could appreciate her position

Her legs in one way and her head another
She just kept thinking about walking away
They tried to put her back together underneath the cover
But her heart kept getting in, getting in the way

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

And he was sweating bullets and walking on glass
Somewhere between the evening news and tomorrow's headline
Buzz awhile

She was a woman sawed in half
It was done by a bad magician
Yeah, it was a clear cut thing, no, you didn't have to ask
She was gonna have to make her own decisions

Her legs got up and walked away and her head came rolling
Oh, the room was painted black light and, and turning the day glow
She wound up in two places at once, her heart was swollen
He played his musical saw in the streets of San Diego

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

She was a woman sawed in half, her legs in Tijuana
She was a bodiless head and trapeze artist in a circus in Bombay
Now a woman's gonna do exactly what a woman's gonna

Yeah, some bad magicians wouldn't have it any other way

How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I say

Through the rain and the drivin' snow
Where she comes from she don't know

She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's wing

If you see her falling
That's just a little trick she does
She makes a dive for the pain that's calling
Then heads for the clouds like a little dove

She can't help her laughing
She can't stop your crying days
Sometimes it hurts to be having
To hold on a love that surely must fly away

And I will fly, he told me so

Many miles before I go
Many miles before I go
Here I go 

Ghosts on the trees, there's
Ghosts on the wires
Asking questions and showing signs
Shivering with truth, they're lighting fires
Lighting fires all down the line 

And I will try, and I will stumble
But I will fly, he told me so

John Hiatt,"My baby's gone and I don't know why 
She let out this morning 
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky 
She left me without warning 
Sooner than the dogs could bark 
And faster than the sun rose 
Down to the banks in an old mule car 
She took a flatboat across the shallow 

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters 

Tobacco standing in the fields 
Be rotten come November 
And a bitter heart will not reveal 
A spring that love remembers 
When that sweet brown girl of mine 
Her black eyes are ravens 
We broke the bread and drank the wine 
From a jug that she'd been saving 

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters 

Baby's crying and the daylight's gone 
That big oak tree is groaning 
In a rush of wind and river of song 
I can hear my true love moaning 
Crying for her baby child 
Or crying for her husband 
Crying for that river's wild 
To take her from her loved ones

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
And she's crossing muddy waters 

Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
And she's crossing muddy waters",Crossing Muddy Waters,2000
John Hiatt,"We came through the forrest
Of jealousy and greed
All our loved ones before us
Gave us everything we need

To cross that great river
Of every tear was ever cried
'till we find ourselves staring in God's golden eyes

In the desert love waited
Licking salt water from her skin
We could have been sedated
For all that we put in

We thought it was some devil
Who put the crying in goodbye
Till we found ourselves staring in
God's golden eyes
We found ourselves staring in God's golden eyes

And we did all we could do
We couldn't run from me and you
We did the best we could
No matter how hard we tried

Like babes we come whining
For some forgotten sin
Surprised to be shining
Just like diamonds in the wind

And every cut the proper size
When we find ourselves staring in God's golden eyes
We find ourselves staring in God's golden eyes",God's Golden Eyes,2000

Out on the highway in a puddle of beer

Just seem to go bad

The fireworks flew in the back of your mind

He's just a little bit more unkind

You were throwing up on your shoes
Tryin' to write the great book when it really had you shook
With a bad case of wintertime blues 

So you drag her down to the ragged side of town
She had a taxi to carry her home
Then she left her handkerchief there beside you on the seat
As if to emphasize that you were all alone

It smelled like springtime, and you were just a boy

When you talk to Sam at the bar

Yeah, close, but no cigar
And you might see your own ass in a double whiskey glass
But you'll never erase her smile
And you'll never write it down, never find her in this town 

Of phantom dreams and fingernail files
It was springtime, and you were just a boy
And all the lilacs in Ohio

And I've been both of those parents, too

In between the life and the lived
I press on through the darkness so thoroughly blind

I crank up my last yesterday
Tasted sweet joy and bittersweet sorrow
And I'd do anything just to come home to you

There's no man so wicked he cannot come home
Nor so good he passes each test

John Hiatt,"[Chorus:]
Thank God the Tiki bar is open
Thank God the Tiki torch still shines
Thank God the Tiki bar is open
Come on in and open up your mind 

I was out on a leave of absence
From any resemblance to reality
I felt like a rocket launched to the great blue yonder
From the boys down at Kennedy 

I was driving by his majesty's court hotel
Where the sign said ""praise his name""
I was tired and alone; I couldn't see too well
But I don't think that he was to blame 

[Chorus]

There's a full moon over Daytona Beach
There's a full moon in my mind
And my suntan dream is still out of reach
And the strip malls are robbing me blind 

Well, his name was Mr. Dale Earnhardt
And he drove the black number three
Now the king is gone, but he'll not be forgotten
Nor his like will we ever see 

[Chorus]

I know a drink ain't no solution
I ain't had one in seventeen years
But if that Tiki bar was closed tonight
Well, I might just disappear

John Hiatt,"You can't sit around waiting for the path to glory
You gotta get movin' to tell your story
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
From the littlest acorns come trees so tall
And where you're comin' from is where you're goin'
Til' you get there you got no way of knowin'

All the love in the world won't find you if you don't let it
Let it ride, let it ride, let it ride
And every mistake is a break but only if you get it
Let it ride, let it ride, let it ride

Everyday is a brand new place
Feel the sun upon your face
Try somethin' new, don't regret it
A hole in your shoe but just forget it

Was his sidekick rowdy Yates?
Drove that wagon train out West
Right along this interstate

Cross the high plains of Kansas
To the Colorado line
Spent a lot of sleepless nights 'round the campfire
They had mountains on their minds

Those high plains people
They're different somehow
You spent your life leaning into a hard wind
I guess you're less likely to take a bow

Drove back through an empty space

I'd like to get some details down
Before I move on to another town

Stand all night in the pourin' rain

A half eaten apple
The whole Sistine chapel

Gone up in a smirk
And you didn't even see her waltz in

Now this love is a ghost, for having played host
To the most unoriginal sin

At the wedding we smiled
While some devil played wild violin
Soon after the chapel
She offered me that apple
One bite and I was gone with the wind

And you needed no proof
Cause the whole naked truth
Was wearing only an infidels grin

And a proud school boys boast
For havin' left his post
For the most unoriginal sin

Al the venial short comings of men
But I found me this drink
That can finally sink

Some trucker sprang a leak
In California they supposed
Started working Arizona
Lord she missed the bloody rose

They rambled through the southwest
Making money and making time
But they never could find no help
Not a doctor, not that kind

You just roll on cold river
Wash little Moses down
We've got business to attend to
In Chicago town, in Chicago town

Some women love their babies
Some women won't have one
Some Texas woman found him
And we're still on the run

The kind of life we're living
He'd only slow us down
Ain't good for nothing anyway
Just rambling town to town

So, you just roll on cold river
Wash little Moses down
We've got business to attend to
In Chicago town, in Chicago town

Well he unpacked his suitcase
She pulled her stockings down
Started dreaming up a pool hall
And shooting up a round

She thought about tomorrow

John Hiatt,"We were coming down the old turnpike
Horse hooves pounding, sledgehammer night
You can tell 'em anything you like
I was there with you baby

Silver and diamonds and a skin full of tears
The road narrowed then it disappeared
Maybe you figured you might wind up some place like here
Acting like you never cared for me baby

Now you shake me off like the dust you're boots are wearing
The leather's soft but I'm cold and fast
Makes me cough 'til I feel my lungs are tearing
I'll never rest 'til I find you at last, find you at last

The ground we covered's cracked and spit with rain
Not enough here to fill the smallest vein
Be all right if this God-forsaken terrain
Just dried up and blew away baby

Maybe my memory's just not right
But we've been baptized by fire and light
Eaten by the earth, swallowed up by the night
I don't care where you think, you're gonna stay baby

Now you shake me off, like the dust your boots are wearing
The leather's soft but I'm hard and fast
Makes me cough 'til I feel my lungs are tearing
I'll never rest 'til I find you at last, oh find you at last
Find you at last, baby find you at last

I've been searching for an answer what a waste of time
Should've picked your trail up sooner
But I couldn't stop the pain
That was breaking up my mind

So I found some open country, I forgot the past
I don't care if you don't want me
'Cause nothing matters any more baby
'Til I find you at last

Tonight you're sleeping on a cold dirt floor
And in my dreams I'm crashing through your door
But you don't recognize me anymore
Do you baby?

John Hiatt,"Caught like a deer in my own headlights
Frozen on this road tonight
I had a fix on the brightest star
Now I'm not sure, where you are

North is south and east is west
Where's the love that I knew best
Shifting in this icy wind
Howlin' down the Cumberland

You're in this valley that I love
Cold and far as the stars above
Do I have to wait 'til spring is here?
Just to hold you warm and near

Dead of winter, dead of night
Not much time to make it right
I know where that lonesome sound begins
Howlin' down the Cumberland

Just a creature in the dark
Longing for one blessed spark
To burn the sky and heat the night
With love reborn by morning light

But nature doesn't heed the call
Nature just commands that's all

John Hiatt,"In the forest of no gravity
Where birds mock reality
We laid out some bread crumbs
Yeah but somebody ate 'em

Always thought we'd make it here
But here keeps movin'
How much blood, how many tears
It's never been proven

Love's not where we thought we left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
Caged love in, tried to protect it
Love's not where we thought we'd left it

The apostles were jealous
Of Mary Magdalene and Jesus
Said, ""Why do you love her more than us?""
Jesus turned back in disgust

Said, ""Why do I love her more than you?
Well the answer is a question
Just ask yourself, 'What can I do
To gain my Lord's affection?' ""

Love's not where you thought you left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
And caged love in, tried to protect it
And love's not where we thought we left it

Oh, when men become more ladylike
I'll see you in the candlelight
When women come to be like men
Oh, we'll be ashamed to fight again

No jealous God's the only one
Father, Mother, Ghost and Son
Love's unorthodox
Changes all of nature's clocks

To time remaining
Just twenty-four hours
For lovers in training
Bitter, salty, sweet and sour

Love's not where we thought we'd left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
And love's not where we thought we'd left it

Lying there on our backs
Swearing to every star that the sky did hold

Giving thanks for the strength just to carry on through the fog and the cold

I want gravy on everything
Lovin' in the kitchen, what have we got to lose
Just a nasty case of these ol' wintertime blues

Cold as snot with a big frozen smile
Ain't foolin' nobody after a while
Time to let the cat out, I've got a real short fuse

Over 
You were waving goodbye in a cherry red Corvette
And you lips were to
Cherry red that is
With the skies so blue
It was almost mean and your eyes were to
So blue that is
And I am to
And my heart burns cherry red for you

[Chorus:]
Now my heart burns cherry red for you
Like a fire of beechwood 
'Cause I don't like it
But you get some cut one match will strike
And the embers glow till the wee small hours
When old seems almost new
That's when my heart burns cherry red for you

It was cherry red with the custom flames
At the hot rod show, when the Kingsmen came
And that bass guitar it rattled my frame
And it shook you to
The Corvette was Big Daddy Ross design
Get you picture for a dollar and have it signed
First you've got yours then I've got mine
And my heart burned cherry red for you

[Chorus:]
That's when my heart burns cherry red for you
That's when my heart burns cherry red for you
That's when my heart burns cherry red for you

Well that big blue sky it sure looked real
Like you were going to California to make a deal
With the God of youth, with the man of steel
Waving toodle loo
Now if I was young I might track you down
But this old picture is all I've found
Now my bones are shaking
My teeth are ground down

Everytime that train come blowin' through

Rollin' down the track
And every trip I took
I never looked to get any feelings back

As you laid spread out on the Sunday paper
Looked like the crime scene of an angel ghost
I heard the gate clatter to on the elevator
I wrapped myself up in it, like a cold beef roast
Fell asleep, was cooked medium
Placed on a dinner room table in Brooklyn
Before an older couple surrounded by family and friends
So wonderful and kind
It flies back to you giving dollars 
To homeless men down in the Bowery
Not before they convinced you
It was for sandwiches and not for wine
I could never convince you baby
That this was our time

This was our time
This was our time

Now you're feeding my fabulous Chinese takeout
On the dampened bedsheets
Our last supper so you might say
I woke up in a cold sweat and realized 
We'd never cooked one meal together
You always said why bother
We have cuisines of the world 
Laid at our feet everyday

And I thought of our first date back in Nashville
We shared the poo poo platter
You enjoyed it with such gusto
I took it for a sign
We would have many happy meals together
In a warm dining room somewhere
Maybe even Brooklyn
That was way back then

John Hiatt,"Grey and chalky like my grandaddy's skin
The sky was cold and lonely and closing in
All the trees looked like stubble, on winter's chin
And I think I'll ride my pony

There's a wreath of bones and ribbon
Hanging on my cabin door
Lusty appetites have ravaged all of summer's stores
And the fear of death don't even come to visit me no more
So I'll think I'll ride my pony

Ride me some place, lonesome has no meaning
Ride me somewhere, I ain't stayed too long
Riding down a mountainside careening
Ridin' up some open cut, with fate my only song
I think I'll ride my pony

While the horseman you might say
He is a slave to the root
But he loves that beast of burden
And there is no substitute
For the pleasure of saddle
Or the leather of his boot
So I think I'll ride my pony

I had a girl in Dixon county
And we rode the Highland rim
She kept my cabin warm in winter
And mended every hem
And I would've took her with me
But that trail never ends
So I think I'll ride my pony

Riding where spring turns up black roses
Wraps its thorns and petals around my mind
Riding somewhere only God supposes
I could ever dream of getting to
I'm sneaking up behind

I know you can say a lot about that

I guess I'll always be your biggest fan

We've been down a rough road or two
This is another one we'll get through
Don't ask me how I know
I'm just saying baby please don't go
'Cause I can still sparkle up your eyes
And you can still cut me down to size
Pleas take me as I am

You wind up dancing with who you bring
I loved you then and my love still stands
Honey I'm still the same old man",Same Old Man,2008
John Hiatt,"It's like I got hearts with you, baby
Like I got two ears
It goes in one and out the other
Whenever you are near
A train of smoke and dreams keeps a coming
Like a burning spear
And I know you, you watch me go
Even as I'm standing here

Doppelganger
Caterwauling
Words trail off low
Love comes and love keeps going
That's really all I know
You hear the sound of a lonesome town
You want to let that whistle blow
But it gets there before you do
And it leaves before you want to go

[Chorus:]
Two hearts, one for me and one for you
Two hearts, do you feel the way I do
Two hearts, one to have and one to yield
Two hearts, and a hundred (million) miles of steel
I keep running back and forth
Running back and forth
For what's real

Could it be this bond between us
That don't scare me none
I've seen ya when you've felt like running
I've seen ya with your gun
A single bullet for the barrel
Midnight chamber spun
Morning kiss
And unclean fist
And you're laughing at the sun

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Two hearts, two hearts",Two Hearts,2008
John Hiatt,"We're were always happiest 
When we needed the least
Who knew this love 
Would turn into such a feast
Breakfast, lunch and dinner
And a midnight snack
I'm full to the brim
But I keep comin' back

You take your tiara babe
I'll take my crown
C'mon honey let's go downtown
Trade 'em in on pauper's rags
And some worn out shoes
Count on the kindness of strangers
That's what love can do

[Chorus]
That's what love can do
Make you feel brand new
That's what love can do
Lose someone you thought was you
That's what love can do
Fire your heart and burn clean through
That's what love can do
That's what love can do
That's what love can do

It's like we laid in this riverbed
For a couple of million years
Shaped by the waters
Till we've nearly disappeared
Two little grains of sand
Locked in the eternal kiss
Don't wake me up now
There's something I might miss 

[Chorus]

You dream a dream
Then the dream comes true
Can you imagine what love can do
You're alone in the coffee shop
And then she's by your side
Love's picked up the tab
And you're both having pie

John Hiatt,"When the road gets dark 
And you can no longer see 
Just let my love throw a spark 
And have a little faith in me 

And when the tears you cry 
Are all you can believe 
Just give these loving arms a try 
And have a little faith in me 
And 

[Chorus]
Have a little faith in me 
Have a little faith in me 
Have a little faith in me 
Have a little faith in me 

When your secret heart 
Cannot speak so easily 
Come here darlin' 
From a whisper start 
To have a little faith in me 

And when your back's against the wall 
Just turn around and you will see 
I will catch, I will catch your fall baby 
Just have a little faith in me

John Hiatt,"Well, I don't need a reason that
I find your love so pleasin'
I know you can carry me back home
Been out in the wilderness
I could use a little tenderness
Baby I know you can carry me back home
 
And I give good as I get
This is a night you will never forget
So I'm not tellin', I'm askin' you
Abandon all known points of view
Honey let me carry you back home
 
I've been sailin' a ship of fools
Past steel-eyed buildings, glass swimming pools
Baby you can carry me back home
They all said the earth was flat
But I think I can live with that
Baby you can carry me back home
 
Trust, that's a word that we know
But how much does it take to let go
I would give my life for you
Do anything to pull you through
Honey let me carry you back home
 
And your love lingers on in my mind
Well after the fact of any moment sublime
 
So I'm not tellin', I'm askin' you

John Hiatt,"Well, I jumped so high
Knocked the table over
Thought I saw a ghost
Come out of the clover
She lived in this house
Forty odd years or so
 
She was buried in the back
With the English and the natives
Slaughtered like sheep
Women and babies
A lot of blood and tears
Three hundred years ago
 
It's like they're caught up in the trees
In the webs of spiders
Spun out of leaves
Ghostly riders
Lookin' for a trail
To find their way back home
 
But there's nothing back there or tomorrow
No place they can put their sorrow
Heavy as death
Cold as a broken stone
 
And I call this place my homeland
And I claim this land I own
But it belongs to another people
They possess it in their bones
 
Well, I can hear them in the night
Like a hundred televisions
Hummin' down low beneath the subdivisions
All they really want is if we can hear Ã¢??em now
 
They been troublin' this plain
Looking for attention
Making crazy tracks
They need an intervention
All they really want
Is to get back home somehow
 
So build up a fire
Say a little prayer
Cook a little meat
Pull Ã¢??em up a chair
And offer them a plate
Maybe we can all find peace
 
You can't bury anything, men or nations
Old memories, old vibrations
The pain doesn't stop just because the killing ceased
 
And I call this place my homeland
And I claim this land I own
It belongs to another people
They possess it in their bones
 
Well, I jumped so high
Straight up off the bedsheet
Nightmare sky
Bloody with the red heat
Started to shake
Cause I couldn't find my way back home
 
Well, I landed in the ditch
Landed in the gutter
Landed in arms of my long lost mother
Cryin' like a child
While the Bayou Pierre groaned
 
And I call this place my homeland
And I love this land I own
It belongs to another people
They possess it in their bones

To try and slam the door in the next one's face”

They're lying in wait

We must not hesitate”

I turned the TV on, wrote a letter to you
The news was talkin' 'bout a dead man upon the interstate
Seems they lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Well since I left California baby, things have gotten worse
Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse
Tell that judge in Bakersfield, my trial I'll have to wait
They're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

It was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside
She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride
Three bank jobs later, four cars hotwired
We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire, Yeah!

Yeah If they'd known what we was up to they wouldn't let us in
Now we landed in Memphis like original sin
Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates
Oh, see we're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Man, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage
There wasn't one Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge
Wasn't one Japanese model or make
Just pretty, pretty Cadillacs' with Tennessee plates

She saw him singing once when she was seventeen
And ever since that day she's been living in between
I was never king of nothin' but that wild weekend
Anyway he wouldn't care, hell he gave them to his friends

Around a wood chipper

Though a lotta little lakes where you could disappear
I wonder what the fish are bitin' on today, Jimmy

She told me not
To follow her down here
Said he was crazy about her

I guess I didn't know
What that meant
Just knew I couldn't do without her

Then I seen 'em through the window sash
He had a Forty four pistol and a bag of cash
And she was foldin' some kinda pretty note paper into her breast pocket

What some people won't do, to break up a happy home

In the middle of no place

On usin' that cash
To get away bold-faced

The troopers and the Marshall's surely on their way
I ran through the yard and I banged my knee on his wood chipper

I was screamin' like a baby
She appeared at the window
He opened the door

And when I looked up
He said ""Skipper
What're you doin' here for""

Askin' myself if I've got what it takes.""

A warm blush of red and a touch of her knee

And I've seen the Northern Lights dance in the air 
But I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss 
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there.""

There's a bitter sweet perfume
Hanging in the fields

In the dawn somewhere to wonder why
By the end of the day
All her sweet dreams would fade
To a lipstick sunset 

Well, a radio was playing
And that ol' summer heat was on the rise
I just had to get away
Before some sad old song
Brought tears to my eyes 

And Lord I couldn't tell her
That her love was only killing me
By the end of the day
All her sweet dreams would fade
To a lipstick sunset 

Well it's pretty as a picture baby
Red and blushing just before the night
Maybe love's like that for me
Maybe I can only see
As you take away the light 

So hold me in the darkness
We can dream about the cool twilight
'Til the dawning of the day
When I make my getaway

And change the message on the Cordaphone

And every memory haunts you 
You write it down in alcohol fire

Now, do I really have to be responsible 
For what I did between those tavern walls?
I was just mixing up some chemicals
You could've heard a pin drop, could have heard time crawl

Would let you write her number down

Smashing a perfectly good guitar
I don't know who they think they are
Smashing a perfectly good guitar

Smash a guitar, and you go to jail
With no chance for early parole
You don't get out till you get some soul

Across the evening sky
But you cannot hide that twinkle

Hitch my wagon to your star

Since I left California baby, things have gotten worse 
Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse

Might build a bridge that lasts

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt
And baggy pants, the old soft shoe

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age

He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles

In fettered stance

He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

I want to hold you just one more time

And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today

Toiling in the burning sun
Disappointed African
Doesn't even over stand

Still he's living in fear
Wondering if and when
He's gonna have his share

A new day's dawning
See the black son's rising
Soon he will be free

See that poor disgruntled youth
Trying his best to know the truth
Why his ancestors have died
From those all who robbed and ruled

So many years of blood and stain
Still he's working in vain
Wondering if and when
He'll ever have his share

Well, guess what's happening

He wonders how some get out there
Sitting in their rocking chair
While he's living in despair

Right on time you would always be there

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl tell me, tell me what am I gonna do?
And I know I've got a guilty face

Yeah girl, what am I gonna do? Do
What am I gonna do?
If you leave me baby what am I gonna do?
I don’t know where to go, who to see yeah

Oh girl, I guess I’ll never know
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I’ve gotta get away from here
Oh girl, girl, girl pain will double if you leave me now

It's hard when you've been paid to please  
So she turns her thoughts to the pillow

The beauty of an empty bed  
She dreams of happy days instead  
Of brooding on to-morrow  

She swapped her dreams of shining knights  
For pushers, bars and money fights  
For nameless faces in red light  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
Those black eyes don't hurt any more  
She's heard the jokes and jibes before  
She's felt the long arm of the law  
So she turns her head to the pillow

It made her feel like going on  
But now she hurts when its all gone

The white clouds in her head grow dim  
And she turns her head to the pillow

Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru

Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,

Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

Quite to his surprise he found her,

Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Too much competition too many other places
But not too many horns can make that sound
Way on down south way on down south London town

You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans played Creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings

she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I
and both shall row - my love and I 
",The Water Is Wide,1999
John Jensen,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

John Jensen,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000
John Jensen,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last,2006
John Jensen,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1989
John Jensen,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1989
John Jeremiah,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rags on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just slicking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
Too early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound",Lake Shore Drive,1997
John Jeremiah,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.

That I'm just your little ampersand.

When your voice springs from the intercom
With announcements, and reminders, and a prayer,
I remember how you made me feel,
I was funny, I was thoughtful, I was rare,
But like the jokes about my figure
Kids think that I don't understand

Catch your eye with ""why'd it have to end,""

You say, ""How are you?"" ""Good luck""
But you don't mean it

You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem

Our planet floating silently in space
Around it, a white dove flies--
Forever circling
Every one hundred years, the dove's wing
Gently touches the surface of the earth
The time it would take for the feathered wing
To wear this planet down to nothing
Is eternity

Within eternity, time passes
Within time, there is change
Soon, the wing of the white dove
Will touch our world again
The dawn of a new Century
Time for a new beginning

Now is eternity
At the break of
Dawn of a century
A thousand years
Of joy and tears
We leave behind

Dawn of a century
Let voices ring
Rejoice and sing

You got nothin' I want, just a pack of lies
That you're down here scrounging, well it's no surprise
For your lies came back to haunt you
Now they're bound to dog your heels
In your eyes I see the panic
Now you know just how it feels

Everybody knows you, everybody knows just what you are
Everybody knows you, everybody heard
Everybody knows you, everybody knows you tried to screw the world

Say what you will, do what you like
Ain't gonna change a thing with your sleazy alibis
You got nowhere to hide, no place to go
Everybody 'round here's just waitin' for the show
For it's time to pay the piper
Yeah, to pay him what you owe

Somebody needs you
Somebody loves you

But golden trophies, fancy toys
Don't compare to childhood joys

Walk beside me darlin' come listen to the rain
And watch the rollin' water to ease your pain again
When night comes down to free us, and sorrow's finally gone
I long to hear your secret dreams and rock you in my arms

There lived a nation proud and free
It tried to show us harmony
But we stood much too close to see
To read the hand of destiny
I know a child who's only seen
A sunrise on the silver screen
She never watched the birds in flight
Or saw the dew by morning light

Another story 'bout the road
And if my going is grieving you
I never said that I was good

Thinking 'bout you is getting in my way

Just another way I was goin'
Another try at being kind
And if my purpose was knowing you
I guess it kinda slipped my mind

Though I can't show you the years of my life
That I spend on the road to freedom
Don't let it throw you, I know of your strife
I know what it's like to roam
I sang 'em a glad song, played 'em a sad song
Sang 'em the whole night long
Just for a dollar or what they could offer
To somebody's ramblin' boy

When the fun was done, I would pack my bags and I was gone
Though the women were kind there was nothing to bind me to one
'Til somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Somebody changed my ole carousing days
Oh when I was a young boy I learned to survive
'Til somebody came and stayed my sportin' life

I lived in the barrooms the juke joints and gin mills
I worked any dive in town
Never to proud to pass my hat around
In every place I found
I'll sing you a glad song, play you a sad song
Sing 'em the whole night long
Just for a dollar or what you can offer
To somebody's ramblin' boy

There were times when lonely was the only feeling left in me
Or when the cold and the rain made it hard on a man to be free
'Till somebody changed my tough and hungry days
Somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Now I don't really care no more 'bout nickels and a dime
The one I love is all I need to help me spend my time
Somebody came and rolled away my stone
Somebody came, and she made me feel at home
Somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Somebody changed my ole carousing days
Oh when I was young boy I learned to stay alive

Rollin' back east to the northern border
I'm back in town to find my favorite folk
But nobody knowsâ?¦and nobody cares
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

I drift by the winos near the greyhound station
Searching for shelter like a castaway
But there are lookers and lechers in a pagan bookstore
That once held a home where I could sing and play
Nothing is left but the faded street signs
To tell me that I knew this place before
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

Everyone warned me not to look for memories
Nothing at all ever remains the same
Now I'm turning around, I'm rollin' back home
Leaving no one behind that will remember my name
But nobody knowsâ?¦and nobody cares
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

",Nobody Lives Here Anymore,1973
John Kay,"
Words and Music by Ron Davies

I got something hard on my mind
I got something hard against my mind
I got a gold mine down in my pocket
And you can have all that you can find
I've got some crazy business on my mind
I need something a little more just to raise my stake
I need something more to raise my stake 'cause she's more than
Any man can ever hope to take
Something more to keep it straight
Goin' down to the corner and find myself a bar
I'm goin' down to the corner I'm gonna lean up against a bar
Gonna sing with the children 'bout the way things really are
Goin' down to the river down to the water wide
Goin' down to the river I'm gonna lay down with my guitar
Gonna sing with the children 'bout the way things really are

When I returned here back from the Islands
You know I couldn't say enough 'bout old Kauai
But now I'm out here on the road
Calling friends back home
But I just get the phone machine and this reply

Ain't nobody home in California
All your friends have gone to Molokai
Ain't nobody home in California
Everybody's off to see Hawaii

May your journey seem forever
May the Islands touch your heart
And if you leave it all the way you found it
May the peace that you'll find never part

I wish I'd be there, back in the Islands
You know, I'd ride along the beach at Hana Bay
But I'm stuck in Waco, Texas
At the Paradise Motel
And now there's no one waiting for me in L.A.
'Cause

Nobody's home in California
All your friends have gone to Molokai
Ain't nobody home in California
Everybody's off to see Hawaii

Soon my travels will be over
And soon a plane will take me home
And just as soon I can make it over
I'll be leaving these words on my phone

Ain't nobody home in California?.

One glass in the mornin', two shots at night
Three fourths anytime that you wanna get tight
Drink wine to remember, swill gin to forget
And blame the world for the peace that you haven't found yet

He stood at the bar with a bottle in his hand
And he complained so bitterly 'bout a world he could not understand
He said ""All my life, I've hustled and paid to survive
Say, can't you see, what's wrong with the world ain't me""

Ain't nothing' like it used to be
Ain't nothing' like it once was
Ain't nothin' like it ought to be
Ain't nothin' right no more

One pill in the mornin', two joints at night
Three spoons any time that you want to feel right
Toot coke to remember, shoot smack to forget
And blame the world for the life you haven't lived yet
Get up in the mornin', give love at night
And take time for yourself when you're losing the fight
Take care to remember, it takes time to forget
Thank God for the time that you haven't had yet

",Ain't Nothin' Like It Used to Be,1978
John Kay,"I was told I had to grease his palm
To walk from school without the fear of harm
He knocked me down and took my dollar from me
And then he lay these pearls of wisdom on me

He say, business is business, nothing is free
Business is business, don't you blame me
Business is business, you've got to pay
Business is business, can't get away
Business is business, a man's gotta live
And what I can take is more than you'd give

Nothing has changed since I left school behind
The bullies now just all wear suits and ties
They'll buy you lunch to get that dollar from you
And then they'll lay the mumbo-jumbo on you

Business is business, nothing is free
Business is business, don't you blame me

The nights are hot and long
Ev'ry day's Saturday night
Down in the quarter

Wish I'd be there tonight

Down in New Orleans
The nights are free and wild
Women will treat you all right
Down from the quarter they're calling me
And I wish I could go tonight

Every time I walk on by
The joints on Bourbon Street
I feel a glow from my head
Right down to my feet
They're places of ev'ry description
Where no one cares who you are
There are people of all persuasions
Carousing in the crowded bars

Down in New Orleans
The nights are free and wild
Women will treat you all right
Down from the quarter they're calling me
And I wish I could go tonight

Walk right on in, sit right down

To watch the dancers undulate

Is hitting the local bar
And everyone in the quarter

Good evening one and all, this is channel 24
Bringing you the latest news around the world
Down in Florida today, someone tried to get away
When he commandeered the train at Disney World
Until noon it was a standoff, but then he lost his luck
When someone shot him down, dressed up like Donald Duck
It was a midget G-man
And we're sorry that we could not show it live
But we'll have film of the shooting here at five

Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control

From Washington today, called a senator to say
That our future has been cancelled 'cause we're broke
We called the white house without end finally reached the President
Says he don't know if it's real or just a joke
And last night at the playoffs, things got pretty grim
They crucified the referee and tore him limb from limb
Ah, you should have been there
And in the weather, there's a hurricane in sight
And that's the way it is with us tonight

Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control

Seems like every single day another mind gets blown away
And the world goes just a little more insane
I got problems of my own, tryin' to keep my house and home
And I sure could stand some cheerful news again
My agent called to tell me my record's on the chart
It's number 90 with an anchor, I never said that it was art
I gotta eat too, ya know
And my buddy who still owes me for his bail
He says, ""don't worry, your check is in the mail""

Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll

Say you'll stay for the night
It feels so right and we're alone
Take my love, take it all
Take it now, and let us fall into the night

From the moment I first saw you
I could tell you were the one
Who could change my way of living
Who could lead me to the sun
All the names, all the faces
That were lurking in my past
Were erased the day I held you
And I knew you were the last

From the time I started moving
I've been trav'lin on my own
Though there were many nights of longing
That I could no stand alone
Like and organ grinder's monkey
Picking pennies from the street
I would scrounge for some affection
With the lovers that I'd meet

But none could show me how to fly
So in the end we said good bye
But in my dreams I saw you waiting
In my mind I heard you saying

Take my love, take it all
Take it now, let us fall into the night

Oh darlin' what is wrong with you
Oh baby it must be somethin' that I do
'Cause ev'rytime that we get down
I wind up feelin' like a clown with you

Eh sweet mama you just got to tell me true
Oh babe what'll do the trick for you
'Cause if I don't know what you need
We just never will succeed

So tell me what you want
And show me how you'd like it done
Tell me what to do
Will you show me what you know
Oh tell me what you need
Will you teach me how you'd like your fun
It's the only way to get it done
And if it takes all night
We're gonna do this till it's right

",Show Me How You'd Like It Done,1978
John Kay,"Words and music by John Kay

I often lie awake at night
And gaze into the sky
I watch the stars move in their flight
And every time I wonder
At the beauty of the view
And when it's magic touches me
That's when I think of you

At times I lie down by the sea
And dream away the day
I hear the laughter of the free
That stroll along the bay
Their arms around each other
Their faces all aglow
Ah, when I see that kind of love
That's when I think of you

Lately I've been wondering about my fellow man
Seems he only want's to know me for his gain
And though I know it's human to take all that you can
Were it not for all your giving, I might never love again

I've tried to find the words
To write my feelings into song
At times I almost got it right
But most just turned out wrong
And this one, it's no different
The words just won't come through
But every time I sing this song
That's when I think of you

I slipped on a banana peel and almost got destroyed
And I was worried all the way down to the ground

John Kay,"Crossing the line in the dead of night
Five years old and on the run
This ain't no game, boy, don't make a sound 
And watch that man with the gun

Say a prayer for the ones we leave behind, say a prayer for us all
Come take my hand now and hold on tight
Take one last look at that wall

Think of the shattered lives, think of the broken hearts
Think of the battered dreams, of families still torn apart
Wall of bitter tears, wall of crying pain
Wall of chilling fear, you will never keep me here

For I, I shall crawl right down through that wall
I will crawl right on through that wall
That fateful night I was one that got away,
A young and restless renegade

Chasing my dreams, still on the run, 
I had some moments in the sun
Years flew by like a speeding bullet train, I sang my songs to one and all
Then came the day when I had a chance to pay 

My respects to the names on that wall
I saw the wooden crosses, saw the bloody stains
Saw the gruesome pictures of all the ones that died in vain
Wall of countless victims, wall of endless shame

Had just one thing gone wrong I might have joined that list of names
And I cried for all who died there at the wall
I recall weeping at the wall
""Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect,
But we've never had to put a wall up to keep our people in""

While the wall is the most obvious demonstration of the failures of communism, 
We take no pride in itâ?¦for it is an offense against humanity, separating families, 
Dividing husbands and wives, brothers and sisters and 
People who wish to be joined togetherâ?¦

All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin 
And therefore, as a free man I take pride in the words ""Ich bin ein Berliner"". 
(Excerpts from John F. Kennedy speech at the Berlin wall June 26, 1963) 
Turned on the news in November '89

I could not move, I could not speak
Something was burning up in my eyes,
Something wet ran down my cheek

All those laughing faces, all those tears of joy
All those warm embraces of men and women, girls and boys
Sisters and brothers dancing, all singing freedom's song
God, if only I could be there to shake your hands and sing along

Oh I, I would climb right up on that wall
And join you all dancing on the wall

If the heart is a lonely hunter
Then the mind is a loaded gun
Sometimes it begins to wonder
If the love you seek is on the run
All day you've been thinkin' 'bout the coming night
It's the only time you really fear
It holds no tenderness
For you're alone in this wilderness

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

A rough night in the daily jungle
And it's tough times on the nightly news
Somehow you ignore the rumble
Of the heart that's shakin' in your shoes
""Someday"", you just keep on sayin'
""Someday, I will find a way to live my dream""
But there's no guarantee
Still, you got hope and your fantasy

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

Keep on dreaming, keep on scheming
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on hoping, keep on coping
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on believing, keep on achieving
Stay fast and young, your time will come

But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

And once the ties with the crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon it went
And till the railroad linked ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end

While we bullied, stole and bought a homeland
We began the slaughter of the red man

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

The Blue and Grey they stomped it
They kicked it just like a dog
And when the war was over
They stuffed it just like a hog

And though the past has its share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
But its protectors and friends have been sleeping
Now it's a monster and will not obey

The spirit was freedom and justice
And its keepers seemed generous and kind
Its leaders were supposed to serve the country
But now they won't pay it no mind
Cause the people grew fat and got lazy
Now their vote is a meaningless joke
They babble about law and order
But it's all just an echo of what they've been told

Yeah, there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into the noose
And it just sits there watchin'

The cities have turned into jungles
And corruption is stranglin' the land
The police force is watching the people
And the people just can't understand
We don't know how to mind our own business
'Cause the whole world's got to be just like us
Now we are fighting a war over there
No matter who's the winner we can't pay the cost

'Cause there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into the noose
And it just sits there watchin'

America, where are you now
Don't you care about your sons and daughters
Don't you know we need you now
We can't fight alone against the monster

America, where are you now
Don't you care about your sons and daughters
Don't you know we need you now

That's the question to be asked
Life goes on around you
In so many different ways
I know my share of histry

From wearing masks that turn to skin
Hiding what could have been

And I, I, I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose?

And can't predict the future

Who's the sanest of us all? 
Is he with me or one of them?
How does he dress, who are his friends?

John Kay,"Words and music by John Kay and Michael Wilk
It used to be when things weren't right
I do my share and join the fight
And would surely stand and speak my mind
Then I got lost along the way
I spent my time chasing my own tail
But I am here to say: I'm back to stay
For I've been searching for the man I used to be
I found him waiting, alive and well
And he was screaming back at me

""Rise and Shine, show your color
Now's the time, raise your hand
Rise and Shine, join your brother
Draw the line, take a stand""

I told my friend my change of heart
He wished me well with my new start
But then he turned away and slowly said:
""You know this world is such a mess
I'm tired of trying to help, I guess""
I said: ""well, what you give is what you'll get
Somewhere inside you, lives the fighter I once knew
The battle's raging, it's never over
It's calling me, it's calling you""

""Rise and Shine, show your color
Now's the time, raise your hand
Rise and Shine, join your brother

I would share her sorrow
About the men that tried to treat her wrong

Though just a baby
A waiting her tomorrow
It's rock me baby,  rock me baby
All night long

She needs an answer to her confusion
Someone to guide her with tenderness
But if she's asking for a solution
All that she gets
You know it's something like this

Don't know where we come from 
Don't know where we're going to 
But if all of this should have a reason
We would be the last to know

So let's just hope there is a promised land
Hang on till then as best you can

John Kay,"You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend
Lyin' on the pavement with a misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on 'til next Monday
But he spent it on some comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?

Someone should call his parents, a sister or a brother
And they'll come to take him back home on a bus
But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
Yeah he'll always be another one of us
He said he wanted Heaven but prayin' was too slow
So he bought a one way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low?
Flyin' low

Don't let fools lead you astray
Live you dreams so you hold on to

I could not speak and I could barely see
Still all the while I knew where I was at

Lord, I could count them all in seconds flat
Well, someday I would be, I knew it all along

And though my dream has come and gone
There's plenty more where those came from

John Kay,"Crawlin' out of bed this mornin', feeling null and void
You drag your remains to the sink
Your eye balls are on fire, your head wants to explode
You swear to god you'll never touch another drink
Stumblin' down to your car, you race against the clock
To everyone who's yellin' at you ""maniac""
You sway and swerve and flip the bird
Your boss is barking as he comes unglued
""Bad Attitude
You're late again, this time you're screwed
Bad Attitude"".

Staring at the coffee mug, your brain feels unemployed
As you slowly emerge from your haze
The bossman over there still looks quite annoyed
Guess this ain't the day to try and talk about a raise
You get up for another cup and stroll on down the aisle
You watch 'em work, these stupid jerks
They just don't appreciate your brilliant mind
They're glaring at you, they think you're rude
Bad Attitude
Now what'd you expect, huh, tell meÃ¢?Â¦gratitude?
Bad Attitude

Drivin' home from work this evening, weary to the bone
You drop by the mall for a meal
A slab of mystery meat, a gut bomb on a bun
And a wrestling video, sweet Jesus, what a deal
But what is slidin' on your tray would make a buzzard nervous
Yeah, with your luck, that hockey puck
You're about to gobble down, will put you out of service

John Kay,"They say that true paradise lies in the heart of man
That maybe so, but I'm ready once more
To run for the cover of my secret hiding place
Where I can burn all the memories of war

Sometimes it's mountains lakes, high in the Sierras
Sometimes the peaceful shore of Hana Bay
And I'll take you with me to share every moment
If you will just promise to do what I say:

Bring nothing but silence
Show nothing but grace
Seek nothing but shelter
From the great human race
Take nothing but pictures
Kill nothing but time
Leave nothing but footprints
To show you came by

So very few places that man hasn't scarred
Taken for granted or taken in vain
I wonder, my child as we lie here beneath the stars
What will be left for your children to claim

Maybe someday you'll be walking on Venus
Maybe some day you may live in the sea
Remember I taught you to love Mother Nature
For it was she who once gave you to me",Nothing But,1997
John Kay,"Every night you are lyin' in a different bed
Every mornin' you don't know where you're wakin'
Everyday you drag yourself from place to place
Tryin' to find the time to keep your body fed

There are times when you'll wonder what your travelin' for
Never reaching a final destination
There are times when you're lonesome and you long for home
And you feel you just can't take it any more

Well there'll be times when you'll fall asleep while standing up
And you can't recall your name or station
Just about the time you think you've had enough
You gotta go, time to do your show

But the sound of the crowd makes you feel all right
When the building is full and they turn down the lights
When the fans starts to roar and there's magic in sight
I would trade places with no one tonight
The sound of the crowd makes it all worth while
When the place starts to shake and they dance in the aisle
When they're up on their feet and the music is right
I would trade places with nobody else alive

Yonder comes the hawkshaw
I wish I knew why he gets paid
To criticize what other people do
Well some are kind in what they write
They're fair in what they say
But he's gone blind in both his ears
Because his head got in the way
After all is said and done
A poison pen will fail
But he who writes with pick in hand
Will finally prevail",Sound of the Crowd,1997
John Kay,"When you say that you want me forever
And you don't want me just while I stay
Do you mean that it's always or never
Can we not share the joys of today
There's a chance that tomorrow I'm leaving
There's a chance of a lonely goodbye
But I've learned long go it ain't easy
And it hurts so much more not to cry

[Chorus]
So I'll build my tomorrows on sweet memories
Of the times we chased away the sorrow
Than to live a lifetime of long emptiness
And to bear the dreams I had to borrow

Well if you don't believe me girl, you'll try in vain
To get things guaranteed in life, except heartaches and pain
And though you try to bind your joy with loving chains
Happiness will come and go like sunshine and rain

[Chorus]

I remember the times full of pleasure
That I shared with the women I knew
There are moments that I'll always treasure
They were special, each one, just like you
So let's not play games with each other
For the time may come soon when we'll part
And though we're no longer together
I will carry you here in my heart",Sweet Memories,1997
