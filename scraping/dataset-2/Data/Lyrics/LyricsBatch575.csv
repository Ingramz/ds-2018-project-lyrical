Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"She's a broken lady, waiting to be mended
Like a potter would mend a broken vase
A broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what's left of the pieces put back in place

Her love is like a fortress around a man she would have died for
Taking care to take of all he needed
But the ladies fortress slowly turned into a prison
And the warning signs he gave, she never heeded

She vowed every morning that what God joined together
No one else in the world could pull apart
Then the walls came tumbling to the ground
And her world came crashing down around her heart

Now she's a broken lady, waiting to be mended
Like a potter would mend a broken vase
A broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what's left of the pieces put back in place

She's a broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what's left of the pieces put back in place",Broken Lady,2000

But cry I will if you go through with me, with me alone
I don't wanna cry this early this mornin'
So lay back down and love me and leave the leavin' till later on

I don't wanna think about tomorrow

Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"What will we do now? You tell me
The hourglass is all out of sand
How could love slip through our fingers
And leave nothin' but time on our hands?
And how will we live now? You tell me
With parts of our hearts torn away
Just existing makes dyin' look easy
But maybe tomorrow I've done enough dyin' today

And how will I sleep now? You tell me
With only my arm my by side
Perhaps I'll learn sleepin' all over
And just maybe without dreamin' this time
And who'll make you laugh now? You tell me
Since you sent your clown on his way
I don't think I'll cry, just die laughin'
But maybe tomorrow I've done enough dyin' today

And how will we live now? You tell me
With parts of our hearts torn away
Just existing makes dyin' look awful easy
But maybe tomorrow I've done enough dyin' today",I've Done Enough Dyin' Today,2000
Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"Smooth talker
He thinks he'll be the one to walk her to his room
But for all of his schemin', he's only dreamin'
He might as well be gone

Because she's got her eyes on the dance floor
She's made up her mind
And the lady takes the cowboy every time

'Cause she's just dyin' to do the Texas 2-step
And she just can't wait to strut her stuff
Dancin' to the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'
So she'll come dancin' till the band stops playin'

At 2 in the mornin'
And still have time for one beer before she goes
Off with her 2-steppin' cowboy
She'll have time for one beer before they go

Tall and handsome
He thinks he'll probably land somewhere in her arms tonight
Well, he thinks he's cool but she thinks he's a fool
He might as well turn and go

Because she's got her eyes on the dance floor
She's made up her mind
And the lady takes the cowboy every time

'Cause she's just dyin' to do the Texas 2-step
And she just can't wait to strut her stuff
Dancin' to the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'
So she'll come dancin' till the band stops playin'

Off with her 2-steppin' cowboy
She'll have time for one beer before she goes

Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"Love is just a game that everybody plays
And when the game is over not everybody pays
Some play the game to lose, some play the game to win
The winners walk out laughing, the losers cry, deal again

Lately you and I have played the game
Now there's no feeling left except for the pain
Finally comes the time to fall apart
And I fine that I am in way over my heart

Oh you've been holding on to holding on
But we can't leave not well enough alone any longer
We're not making love, we're keeping score
It's a simple matter, it don't matter anymore

Take me right now

'Cause forever is one thing I ain’t got to give
Worrying about forever makes me dying slow
And lady I’m just dying to live

I ain’t got no room for no profit of doom
Trying to scare me out of my mind
'Cause my future is in much bigger hands than mine

That I'm never, ever gonna say goodbye

To keep on wearin' the city's ball and chain

Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"There was a young man who had the best of everything
He was the first born of a wealthy man
But he was not satisfied with the best of everything
So he took his possessions in his hand

He traveled far and wide and he tasted worldly pleasure
But deep inside, he was lonely without measure
He wound up in a pig pen, nearly dead
Then he raised his eyes toward Heaven and he said

I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will beg him to forgive me for the fool I've been
I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will gladly be a servant if he'll take me back again

After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore, no more,
It's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture

Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to know the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial

You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I
I ain't goin' stop

Larry Gold,"Oh, yeah, oh huh
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that my outlook's gotta change

That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For every time somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
Take the time to look at what is mine

I see every lesson completely
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song

I never want to dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day

'Cause I'm about to
Say goodbye to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
I'm gonna keep on singing my song

Whoa, and every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see
All the good around me
They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Simply just remembering to breathe

I'm human, I ain't able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time

I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above I've made the decision
Never to give up
Til the I day I die no matter what I'm gonna carry on & keep on singing my song

(They can't take anything from me)
I believe that they can do what they wanna
Say what they want to say

(They can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna keep on
(Keep on )
I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace

Say what you want to say, but I'm gonna sing my song

Larry Gold,"People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with your picture
And smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say yes

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free
Free, make me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so sweet
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me

Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

Its so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me

Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me
Yeah",Loving Me 4 Me,2002

And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control

We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true

It hurts my soul

Would you take the leap of faith?
Would you throw it all away?

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry

短く長い一日の始まり
決められたする事もなく
ブラブラ町を歩く

透きとおる青い空
太陽さえもじゃまなくらい
2人で HAPPY LUNCH TIME
お腹も愛も満タン

僕とあなたと 2人だけで
素敵な星空がくるまで
僕とあなたと 2人だけで

Happy Sunday. It's my life
Don't worry be happy.

どうしたの?
何があったの
何をそんなに悩んでるの
でも心配することなんて
何一つもないよ

簡単に自分を責めたり
自信をなくさないで

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Spoken by Trey [with asides by Fishman]:
Once upon a time Far far away from here 
There, in a small town...
A small town... 
Small town...
Small...

And on the outskirts of this town 
There lived a mean, nasty, furry, ugly hound named Harpua. 

Harpua roamed the outskirts of the town every day and he'd walk around looking for a little action. 
So of course this day was no different from any other day and here we start the story and we see Harpua walking around on the outskirts of town near the forest kind of at the edge of the forest and he's walking in toward town...
Harpua walked toward the town...
Innocently...
And meanwhile in the town...
In a whole different part of the town 
There lived a young boy all alone in a suburban neighborhood 
And every day he'd sit in his room 
And sit on his little couch [AND SMOKE POT!]... 

he'd sit on his little couch and 
He'd listen to his stereo...
And he'd lay back and 
He'd look down next to him and 
He'd pet his favorite little [DOG!] 
Furry little...
Oh, he loved his little...
Furry...
Thing that he pet every day while he listened to his stereo 
[while sitting on the couch] 
He'd pet his furry [thing on the couch] his furry...
And he looked down and he said 
""I love to pet you, my little furry...
Thing that I ... 
I love you so much that I decided to name you 
This name that I love and so I named you...
I love you so... 

that's why...
That's why I pet you every day...
That's why I named you...
That's why when I first got you and 
I knew how much I loved you...

I decided that I'd give you the name of... 
The moniker of...
I'd call you...
Your name is... 

I DECIDED THAT YOUR NAME WOULD HAVE TO BE... 
I'D CALL YOU...
YOUR GOING TO BE CALLED... 
I THINK YOUR NAME...

YOU'D GO AS... AAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!
POSTER NUTBAG!!!!!!!!

Poster Nutbag sat on the couch next to Jimmy... 
Poster Nutbag, the furry little kitty-cat Jimmy's pet sat next to Jimmy and he looked up at Jimmy...
And on this particular day Poster Nutbag decided to go for a little walk so Poster Nutbag got up and walked toward the door and Jimmy went to the door and he opened up the door and Poster Nutbag went outside and he started walking across the yard.. 
And he walk onto the sidewalk and he started walking innocently down the street and he walked down the street and suddenly he found himself wandering... 
Into a new part of town that he'd never been to...

Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN

And when he got there he was walking along and suddenly he rounded a corner and in front of him he saw...
He saw Harpua...
Harpua, the ugly dog from the beginning of the story...
And they looked at each other...
Tension filled the air... 
There was going to be a nasty fight...

Harpua saw Poster Nutbag and began to growl and let a hungry drop of saliva fall onto the floor... 
Poster Nutbag coiled his body into a deadly arch... 
The fight was about to begin...
ARGAAAAAAAA!

Look, the storm's gone...Dad [Mike]: 
Jimmy...
Jimmy [Fish]: 
Yes, Dad

D: Jimmy, I have some bad news...
J: What might that be...Dad?
D: It's about your cat, Poster...
J: You wouldn't be talking about Poster Nutbag, now would you?
YOUR CAT DIED!

A dog A dog
There's a dog in the station
With an ugly mutation
And it needs lubrication each day
There's a dog in the station
Contemplating rotation
As a form of recreation and play

A dog
There's a dog in the station
With a bad reputation
It's a sign of the nation's decay
But the dog in the station
Doesn't need a vacation

As the people rush by dressed in gray
A DOG
A DOG

Now ""The Wildwood Flower"" is an old country classic
It gained a whole new popularity
The song isn't any more popular
But the flower is doin' real good

The wildwood flower grew wild on the farm
And we never knowed what it was called
Some said it was a flower and some said it was weed
I didn't gave it much thought

One day I was out there talking to my brother
Reached down for a weed to chew on
Things got fuzzy and things got blurry
And then everything was gone
I Didn't know what happened
But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap

I come to and my brother was there
And he said, 'What's wrong with your eyes?'
I said, 'I don't know, I was chewing on a weed'
He said, 'Let me give it a try'
We spent the rest of that day and most of that night
Trying to find my brother, Bill
Caught up with him 'bout six o'clock the next mornin'
Naked, swinging on the windmill
He said he flew up there
I had to fly up and get him down
He was about half crazy

The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds
And put 'em in the sun to dry
Then we mashed 'em up and we cleaned 'em all
And put 'em in the corncob pipe
Smokin' them wildwood flowers got to be a habit
We didn't see no harm
We thought it was kind of handy
Take a trip and never leave the farm

A big ol' puff on the wildwood weed
Next thing you know
We's just wandering behind the little animals
All good things gotta come to an end
And it's the same with the wildwood weed

One day this feller from Washington come by
And he spied us and he turned white as a sheet
And he dug and he burned
And he burned and he dug
And he killed all our cute little weeds
Then he drove away

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

Larry Norman,"I was born and raised an orphan in a land that once was free
In a land that poured its love out on the moon;
And I grew up in the shadows of your silos filled with grain,
But you never helped to fill my empty spoon.

And when I was ten you murdered law with courtroom politics,
And you learned to make a lie sound just like truth;
But I know you better now and I don't fall for all your tricks,
And you've lost the one advantage of my youth.

You kill a black man at midnight just for talking to your daughter,
Then you make his wife your mistress and you leave her without water;
And the sheet you wear upon your face is the sheet your children sleep on,
At every meal you say a prayer; you don't believe but still you keep on.

And your money says in God we trust,
But it's against the law to pray in school;
You say we beat the Russians to the moon,
And I say you starved your children to do it.

You are far across the ocean but the war is not your own,
And while you're winning theirs, you're gonna lose the one at home;
Do you really think the only way to bring about the peace
Is to sacrifice your children and kill all your enemies?

The politicians all make speeches while the news men all take note,
And they exaggerate the issues as they shove them down our throats;
Is it really up to them whether this country sinks or floats?
Well I wonder who would lead us if none of us would vote.

Well my phone is tapped and my lips are chapped from whispering through the fence,
You know every move I make, or is that just coincidence?
Well you try to make my way of life a little less like jail,
If I promise to make tapes and slides and send them through the mail.

And your money says in God we trust,
But it's against the law to pray in school;
You say we beat the Russians to the moon,
And I say you starved your children to do it.
You say all men are equal, all men are brothers,
Then why are the rich more equal than others?

That a man leaves his darkness when he follows the Son",The Great American Novel,1972

He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine

They just placed a marble stand in front of it

I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time

Larry Paxton,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999

But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill

Larry Paxton,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

Cause therels something in a sunday

Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,

Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

Larry Sparks,"A face in the crowd on your wedding day
You tossed me a rosebud from your bridal bouquet
No one seemed to notice no one wondered why
When you pledged your love to him there were tears in my eyes.

   A face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose
   Your gown of white satin my half-worn-out clothes
   I knew your love one time but your love now he holds
   I'm a face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose.

As your friends they all kissed you I heard someone say
The man with the rosebud from your bridal bouquet
Was he kind of special or was he just a friend
I heard you speak softly he was only a friend.

Cause the air is filled with gold dust 
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands 
Now I don't recall who said it 
But we'd lived so long on credit 
And so we headed out to find our promised land 

Just poor Smoky Mountains farm folk 
With nothing more than high hopes 
So we hitched our station wagon to a star 
But our dreams all fell in on us 
Cause there was no land of promise 
Though it's a stuggle just keepin' sight of who you are 

Oh and these northern nights are dreary 
And my southern heart is weary 
As I wonder how the old folks are back home 
But I know that they all love me 
And they're all thinking of me 
The Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong 

You know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately 
About what's been and what awaits me 
It takes all I've got to give what life demands 
You go insane if you give in to it 
Life's a mill and I've been through it 
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands 

Oh and these northern nights they're dreary 
And my southern eyes are teary 
As I wonder how the old folks are back home 
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus 
He'll love and guide and lead us

If I'll keep looking to the father 
Keep our heads above the water 
While the Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

You left it there, so all alone

It's been neglected, feels unwanted

Since no love, to it is shown

 

It's beauty now, is fastly fading

Once it was, the brightest red

It's withering fast, It's head is bowing

And no kind words, to it are said

 

Chorus:

Please don't neglect the rose, In your garden

Show it your love, every day

Then it will bloom for you in all it's beauty

And it will not, fade away

 

I guess by now, you know my story

Don't neglect, a love that's true

For it may prove to be, the sweetest flower

That will ever, bloom for you

 

It could be a mother, sister or brother

A husband, wife, or little child

Or it may be, your own true lover

The sweetest place in all the world
In a cabin with the vines o'er the door

Just a humble abode among men,
While in Heaven a mansion is waiting for me
And a gentle voice pleading ""come in"".

There's a mansion now empty, just waiting for me
At the end of life's troublesome way.
Many friends and dear loved ones will welcome me there
Near the door of that mansion some day.

Promised unto the weary sweet rest;
Nothing more could I ask than a mansion above,
There to live with the saved and the blest.

And my hands shall lie folded in rest,

He had enough dying, all the grief that he could take
From the Appamattox Courthouse, where the deed was sadly done
There was no place left for him to go but home

He walked all the way home to Southampton County
To carry all he owned and try to forget
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain
He walked all the way home to start his life again

In the end he knew the reasons but so many had been lost
For years to come the fallen would sleep beneath the cross
What he held in angry silence, time could never burn away
It was just the saddest price he'd ever pay

He walked all the way home to Southampton County
To carry all he owned and try to forget
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain
He walked all the way home to start his life again

When he stopped to take some water at a little roadside place
A pretty southern widow sadly looked into his face
As they talked a while his blue eyes seemed to ease her broken heart
One day he came back and took her home

I wondered there to take my chances, Twenty some odd years ago.

I?ll not forget first time I saw her, A vivid picture in my dreams.
A southern bell in soft white cotton, clinging to her like a breeze.
(CHORUS)

Nothing?s sweet as Georgia peaches, when you pick them for yourself.
Wait too long there?re out of season, They?ll be gone to someone else.

She ask me Boy where do you come from? Are you only passing through?
I?d like to know what brings you down here, I made her smile when I said YOU.

A stolen moment too quickly faded, as she pulled away her hand.
She said I?m sorry it?s been taken, promised to another man.

Takes me back to my favorite memory, Of the Georgia girl I left behind.

Larry Stephenson Band,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best

Larry Stewart,"There's a movie on TV tonight, about a lonely guy
But I don't need nobody to remind me
I don't want to talk about the pain or all the reasons why
I just want to leave it all behind me, I'm going out on the town
Not gonna drown in my sorrow

I'll cry tomorrow
Just as soon as my heart can find the time
I'll cry tomorrow
'Cause I'm too busy living tonight

The memory of your face as you were walking out the door
Is fading with each song the band is playing
And I'm finding I don't have to think about you any more
The world still goes around is what I'm saying
I'm not over you yet, I'm just good at forgetting my sorrow

",I'll Cry Tomorrow,1993
Larry Stewart,"Here we are after years of love
We're thinkin' of goodbye
And it's hard not to feel your touch
When I hurt so much tonight
Lyin' here pretendin' we're sleepin'
When we're both wide awake
Should we hold on to what we've got
Or go our separate ways

We can run, we can hide
And just turn away and hold our hurt inside
Take our pride and walk away
We can stand, we can fall
Now it's time for us to win or lose it all
We can run, we can hide
Or we can love

In the dark I can hide the truth
I wish that you could see
In my heart what I want most
Is to hold you close to me
Why can't we just talk to each other
Admit we've made mistakes
If I won't bend and you won't give 
Our hearts are bound to break

We can run, we can hide
And just turn away and hold our hurt inside
Take our pride and walk away
We can stand, we can fall
Now it's time for us to win or lose it all
We can run, we can hide
Or we can love

Pretty as a lady calling
For her pink and midnight lover

Oceans of tears,

And death without reason

To your greatest expectations

With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the love that's never spoken

Larry the Cable Guy,"Some girl's banging on my door the other day at four o'clock in the morning. I was like, ""What in the world?"" You know? So I got up and let her out. Tell you what, I was madder than Janet Reno's blind date. 

I met this guy a while back, looked like Shania Twain. Only a little shorter, and, uh, faces were different. I was drunk, it looked like Shania Twain. Next morning Mark Twain is laying there next to me there, he--ho, ho--she was ugly, now. I take her to Glamour Shops, get her an estimate, you know. She was--man, she was ugly right there. She had marks on her from where people had been touching her with the ten-foot poles! 

I don't like Miami too much though, there's a lot of drugs and stuff. I was down there in broad daylight, car drive by, says, ""You want some cocaine?""

I'm like, ""No, officer.""

I don't do drugs. I don't know what I'm doing. I tried smoking mushrooms once, couldn't keep the pizza lit, you know, so I quit doing that. I tell you, I was madder than a three-legged dog trying to bury a turd on an icy lake, I tell you what. 

Has it ever happened to you when you make love to your girlfriend and the dog licks your hind-end?
Now that--Lord, I apologize, for talking about the dog licking my crack there, and be with the starving pygmies down there in New Guinea. Amen.

I don't like them. 
If I had a dollar for every fake boob I tongue-kissed last week, I'd have--well, I wouldn't have any money or nothing, I'm just saying.

But we was up there--there was somebody up there selling Yoko Ono CDs at the flea market. Now what kind of waterhead is buying a daggone Yoko Ono CD?

""Hey, you wanna come over and listen to my Yoko Ono record?""

Larry the Cable Guy,"This is the story of the first Thanksgiving, once again by my drunk grandpa:

Many years ago...Christopher Columbus and his pilgrim buddies come to America on a boat called the Mayflower to live because the English King wouldn't let the Jewish people go.
So Moses, who was a friend of Christopher Columbus, rented 3 boats: the Mayflower, the Santa Maria, and the USS Enterprise.
When they landed on America, and indian squaw, named Sacagawea, met them and traded them pelts for beer, and then showed them how to de-gut a rabbit.
That night her friends danced around with their boobs hanging out and balanced clay pots on their heads.
The head pilgrim then baptized all the Indians to be Christians and they shot turkeys and played horseshoes. 
It was General Custer's birthday, and three Oriental Kings showed up with gifts of myrrh and other crap.
Many pilgrims did not survive the first winter because they didn't have heat because Jimmy Carter who was president of the Pilgrims had an oil embargo.

Sacagawea and her Indian friends burnt buffalo turds and heated the camp.
The pilgrims was thankful.
However it smelled so bad animals come outta the forest two by two.
The Lord then made a rainbow appear, to show that he would never make turds burn again, and cause a horrible smell.
Sacagawea fell in love with Kemosabe, and they were married on that first Thanksgiving, and lived in a tent with wheels. That's right.
All the pilgrims were glad to be away from the king, and to beat that they all landed right on Thanksgiving day.
Charlton Heston was then elected president.

My grandpa was REALLY drunk.

Where else can one have so much culture within ones reach?
I love to see those girls with big hair cruising down the strand
And see those rednecks get redder instead of getting tan.

But Myrtle Beach is not my favorite part of the trip
I first must make a little stop before I get to it
So lets hop into my Nova and head for that state line
And when I see that big sombrero Ill know everything is fine.

Take me to South of the Border I think you know the way
Just follow those clever billboards along the interstate
Take me to South of the Border I love those neon signs
Chili Today, Hot Tamale man, that one gets me every time.

Well check into Pedros Motel and leave our troubles at the door
Then its off to Pedros Fireworks -- well stock up for July 4
Then over to Pedros Martial Arts to get some gifts for the kids
I think they'll like some throwing stars, num chucks and a big bullwhip.

Then its down to Pedros T-shirts where Ill have the time of my life.
Lets get grandma that funny hat that reads Old Farts Wife
And lets get dad some underwear that will scream Hey, I'm high class
The ones with the inscription Worlds Largest Source of Natural Gas.

Take me to South of the Border down where Pedro lives 
I need to buy some Chia pets they make such great gifts
Take me to South of the Border just below that state line
When I see that big sombrero, Ill know everything is fine.

OK. I want everyone listening out there to sing the chorus with me.

Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Lars Erstrand,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Lars Frederiksen & the Bastards,"Up in the morning and out to school
Mother says there be no work next year
Qualifications once the Golden Rule
Are now just pieces of paper

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

Well if you look the part well then you'll get the job
In last year's trousers and your old school shoes
The truth is son it's a buyer's market
They can afford to pick and choose

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm a lazy
Just because that I dress like this
Doesn't mean I'm a Communist

Well the factories are closing and the army's full
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I've come to see in the land of the free
There's only room for a chosen few

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm a lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

Well at 21 you're a top of the scrap heap
At 16 you were top of your class
Well I dropped outta high school in Campbell, California
Got a guitar and I never looked back

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm a lazy
Just because that I dress like this
Doesn't mean I'm a Communist

Lars Gullin,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1950
Lars Gullin,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1953
Lars Gullin,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Lars Gullin,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart",You Stepped Out of a Dream,1963
Lars Gullin,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1992
Lars Gullin,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?",Jeepers Creepers,1992
Lars Gullin,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1992
Lars Gullin,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,1994
