Ben Selvin,"I'll have to see my broker, 
Find out what he can do, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you.

There won't be any joker, 
With margin I'm all through, 
'Cause I want you outright, it's true.

You're going up, up, up in my estimation, 
I want a thousand shares of your caresses, too.

We'll count the hugs and kisses, 
When dividends are due, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you!",I'm in the Market for You [2],1998

For Broadway always wears a smile

A million hearts beat quicker there

They seem so happy and gay
Though they sing and they swing as they sway
Somehow I can't feel that way

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

While the throng's in the spell of a song
My thoughts keep drifting to you
While each pair seems to share their affair
They're making me blue

'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new

I'm feeling mighty sick and sore
So bad I feel
I said I'm feeling sick and sore

And so afraid

Yearning to see the dawn,
Counting the hours till I can lay down my load.
Weary, but I don't mind,
Knowing that I'll soon find
Peace and contentment at the end of the road.

The way is long, the night is dark,
But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark
Will be singing at the end of the road.
I can't go wrong, I must go right,
I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light
Will be shining at the end of the road.

There may be thorns in my path, but I'll wear a smile,
For in a little while my path will be roses!

The rain may fall from up above,
But I won't stop 'cause the one I love
Will be waiting at the end of the road.

Say, the way may be long and the night is dark,

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

When I lift this shell to my ear
I can hear your voice crying out
Rain, your magic's all around me
When you bring the heavens down
I can fly until I dry out

Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.

Rain, come down upon my ceiling
Wash my sorrow for me until I find some sleep
Jay, come haunt me while I'm healing
Remind tomorrow for me so I can get some peace

Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.

Wash your wisdom on me

Until my mind is free

Proud of yourself about the lonely way you keep grovin'

And all sorts of people will try to deceive you

Ben Taylor,"First morning ever to have seen the sun
Must have run the other way
Until she found that it was only getting earlier that way
When she spun one-hundred eighty degrees
And beheld the sweet light rising through the trees
She fell to her knees and she began to smile, because
She had been in darkness for a long long while,
She said...

There is nothing that I can do but belong to you
Heaven and Earth and I find myself
Sining this song for you
As luck would have it, it just so happens that there's
Nothing I'd Rather do

And the first lesson ever to have learned its way
Must've been surprised
All I can say is I'm just glad that I survived,
And the first river to have met the sea,
I believe he must've sighed, said
All this rambling I'm blad to finally find, that
After all I haven't just been wasting my time.

There is nothing that I can do but belong to you
Heaven and Earth and I find myself
Singing this song for you
As luck would have it, it just so happens that there's
Nothing I'd Rather do.

Just so long as your flying around high
Whatever you find out in the sky
Don't forget to fall down sometimes
I'm easy to find, look around you
It's a good thing that I finally found you.

Give me a reason to be, a woman

Sow a little tenderness

America, yeah we can keep on dreaming but there's so much to, so much to lose.
So much to lose.

She was as pretty as a dream, the most amazing girl I've ever seen
But not did just she look good, she made me free, 
She said you belong with me and I won't see your spirit in shackles

State makes apple wine for the paradise fair
And he did pass the lashes of her eyes, let her hair down
Dancing feels so fine I don't wanna go nowhere 
But she gets thirsty for apple wine sometimes

America, how can we believe it after what we been through?
America, yeah we can keep believing but there's so much to, so much to do.
So much to do.

And so she took up with a white man who seemed to have no feelings
He just couldn't get it right man, kept killing and stealing
And he moved all of her tribesman to lives with lower ceilings
Where their stories weren't needed, the forgotten wives

Made his self king and made his fools gods
Traded guns and lives and drugs and cod
His wealth grew greater, 
He never learned to sing but he always was a rather good sailor

Hey yeah

America, how can we believe it after what we been through?
America, yeah we can keep believing but there's so much to loose.

America, America, how can we believe it after what we been through?
America, we can keep on dreaming but there's so much to, so much to loose.

And so old man time could never really treat her right
She cried and cried and tried to make him see the light
He only lied and always had to pick a fight
He spends most of his time abroad now-a-days
So, now she's mine and I'mma get her back on track
I've drawn the line and I'm not looking back 
Because it's long past time and even if she's been through hell
With scars and lies she's still so fine, my America

How can we believe it after what we been through?
America, we can keep believing but there's so much to loose.

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Where all the saints adorned the walls.

Under the shadows engulfed

She said 'tuck me in'

Still he pulled back the sheets

You better lie down 'cause the angels are watching
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
You can hurt me do whatever you like'

He hoped this wouldn't be his.
She said 'tell me what to do'
He knew right then he was done
Felling lonely and confused
He said 

[Chorus]
You better lie down the angels are watching'
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
You can hurt me do whatever you like'
So he said 'shut your mouth girl the angels are listening'
She crossed herself now the moments are missing
You can hurt me do whatever you like'

Glancing through the curtain
Questions unheard of
She spoke in third person
And he had seen everyone
Awkward and embittered
Said 'shut the door when you go' 
Perhaps he should've reconsidered (oh no)

You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me

But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good

Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Christ, I know you can't hear me,

I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.

I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
He is not a king. He is just the same
As anyone I know.
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?
My mind is in darkness.
God, God I'm sick. I've been used,
And you knew all the time.
God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.
You're so bloody, Christ.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep

He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to him

And worship the trousers that cling to him

Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

I really didn't
I'm so sorry
I just want you to sit down for just a minute
Let me talk to you

Last night we had an argument
You told me you love me
All the things I said I never meant
No baby
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to make you say bye bye bye
Baby won't you let me look inside your soul
Let me make you lose control
Let me be the one you need
Baby just come to me

Now tell me girl what you want from me
Whatever it is you desire
I want to give my baby
I want to feel your body yearn
All your softest spots I plan to learn
Baby won't you let me just kiss you down
Make you spin around and 'round
Flip you girl from left to right
If you don't mind
Baby can I just spend the night

You know what I'm talking about baby
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
So I'm right here now baby
I'm asking you, I'm begging you
Just give me one more chance baby

Baby won't you let me just kiss you down
Make you spin around and 'round
Flip you girl from left to right
If you don't mind
Baby can I just spend the night
Let me turn you on

Can I turn you on
Can I turn you on
Till the break of dawn baby

Can I turn you on
Can I turn you on
Till the break of dawn baby",Lose Control,2008
Ben Watt,"Before I left there was a weekend when we walked
We barely saw a soul for two whole days
The Sussex downs after rainfall is as lovely as it gets
But really I should let
Let it all slide

How the light can fall in so many different ways
Some memories you deal with but some are tough
There are moments of joy that will go unmet
But really I should let
Let them all slide

But who am I fooling when I say I have no regrets
You can push things to the back of your mind
But you can never forget

I washed your hair in the darkness of the house
I saved a creature from the heat of the fire
And when you rose I saw your silhouette
But really I should let
Let that all slide

But who am I fooling when I say I have no regrets
You can push things to the back of your mind
But you can never forget

But who am I fooling when I say I wish we'd not met
You can push things to the back of your mind
You can push them there but still you will find
That you push them there to the back of your mind
But you can never forget

That you push them there to the back of your mind
But you can never forget

You push them there to the back of your mind

And the river serpentine
Ribbons of wild geese
Above the cedars and the pines

Feathered hopes and blackened suns

And where did you get the selfish streak?
See the bad in everyone

The lingering rolling feet, candles and toys and
A sea of flowers, all from strangers, I think of Nathaniel,
""We'll always love you"", ""Nathaniel, we'll always love you!

At first, you deny it, and ten you get angry that they've gone
You try making a bargain, and then you accept it and you go on

at the late nights, but just look at me
I'm staking a claim in a young man's game tonight

Is it something that my old heart fears?
Missed time, chances, lost years
That means I'm taking aim at a young man's game tonight

One more chance to leave a mark
Imagining the answers in the dark
Such a simple step into the smoke and the light tonight

But who'd have thought I'd have turned this page?
Should I act this out or act my age?
Am I happy I came to the young man's game,
Where the bouncers know me by my name, tonight?

Oh I could I work this room
I could make some noise
Let's hear it for the girls and for the boys
For a moment be the same in the young man's game tonight

Heroes in a wild conceit
Fingering fame in the young man's game tonight

But every mirror just tells the time

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy (Londonderry Air),1959

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

Or I'll never fall in love

Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Ben Webster,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon

And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1970

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

If then you chance to find there's someone on your mind

Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree

Decided to say, ""I do""
So they rode to June and glory
On a bicycle built for two

Hear the past, the song is old
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, ""I love you""

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Are true to this very day
For he loves her in December
As he did in May

And one of the manifestations of this
Is the return to the association of the individual
And his own feeling, his own emotions

Hidden by an incidental smile

It’s time to live out your wildest dreams 
If you want me I will go with you 

Take those shoes off and we're gonna fly
Make an exit and say good bye
To the streets we’re gonna start a new 
Turn the speakers up and let's dance

Get the car and go into town
Meet some peeps that like to get down
Maybe grab a drink or two with you
(Or three with you)
And the heat is warming your skin
And you know me we 'bout to go in 
That the spirit's gonna take you away
We are sinners but do we sin
Don’t know when or where to begin 
We keep rolling as the day goes by, high

Looking out ‘cause everyone’s gone 
Lost my phone somewhere along the way (where's my phone)
Can't get through to all of my friends
And i’m so far away from my ends 
And know the night bus doesn't take me there (or anywhere)
So I take a walk on my own 
So i’m in direction of home
Falling, I see deezie ? stumble by
And I know that this ain’t right tryin to keep all of my side 
I’ll only bed seems like a bed to me

Ben Wilmot,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2000
Ben Wilmot,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

Ben's Brother,"Sitting in my bedroom
Thinking of a love gone
Wondering why it went wrong
Over again

You didn't really know me
And it feels like you owe me
But I guess at least you showed me
Not to do it again

'Cos I've been knocked out, found out
About time that it turned around
'Cos I've got to find the one thing
That will get me over you, so

One day, you've gotta find me an angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day, you've got to send me an angel
'Cos I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding out for more this time

I'm tired of being lonely
I'm getting to it slowly
But I'm running out of patience
Running out of strength

There's got to be a reason
For everything I'm feeling
But I think I've learned my lesson
I'm never doing it again

'Cos I've been knocked out, found out
About time that it turned around
'Cos I've got to find the one thing
That will get me over you, so

One day, you've gotta find me an angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day, you've got to send me an angel
'Cos I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding out for more this time

I'm not unbreakable
But what I'm trying to say
Is I don't think I am capable
Of doing this alone so

One day, you've gotta find me an angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day, you've got to send me an angel
'Cos I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding out for more this time

C'est à dire qu'il y avait tellement de l'ambiance à cette époque là
Et comme j'étais un beau garçon
Quand je vois que je fête mes 30 ans aujourd'hui alors que j'avais 18 ans hier
Les jours passent comme les voitures
La vie de l'homme ne dure pas longtemps
Quel est Le Bilan de ma vie, hein, hey?

C'est fou ce que le temps passe vite
Ah si, c'est ce que je me dis aussi quand j'vois le chemin qu'on a parcouru jusqu'aujourd'hui
Je repense à notre enfance pas toujours aisée
Sans trop dramatiser
Ce n'était pas toujours rose c'est peut-être ce qui nous a motivé
L'esprit était déjà Neg'Marrons petits vagabonds à têtes grainées
On préférait sécher les cours et rester s'vanner au quartier
L'excès de curiosité était tel
Qu'on s'enjaillait en suivant les aînés qui étaient pour nous des modèles
À l'époque dans les halls les gangs breakent, smurfent, parfois se rebellent
Fresh Boys, B-Boys représentaient Garges-Sarcelles
Je me rappelle y'avait des bandes et des gangs
Y'avait même des gang-bangs
C'est vrai qu'on bandait à peine mais on voulait déjà ken
Partager nos kiffs, nos ambitions, objectifs, ddevenir quelqu'un
Un point commun celui de réussir par tous les moyens
Maintenant j'comprends Ben-J que quand on était gamin
On avait le même itinéraire mais pas le même destin

Le temps passe et passe et passe et beaucoup de choses ont changé
Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant
Parler des histoires d'avant comme si on avait 50 ans

Ben-J tu te souviens ce qui nous a donné l'envie d'écrire
L'oreille scotchée sur Nova à l'écoute des MCs qui déchirent
De là nos premières rimes naissent
Les jeux de mots, puis les jeux de scène
Ne cessent de s'enchaîner des MJC aux sound systems
Et puis en un éclair nous voici sous les projecteurs
On s'adapte et on domine, professionnel ou amateur
Tu le sais
C'est la monnaie qui dirige le monde, c'est la monnaie qui dirige la terre
Nous propulse aux sommets des hits de là tout s'est passé si vite
C'est boule de neige, premier album, studio, promo, clip vidéo
Les Neg'Marrons s'exportent en live et prennent tous les publics d'assaut
Dans les quatres coins de la France on est partis fout' le dawa
Comme dans les avant-premières de Steel Pulse et des Fugees à Ris-Pa
On a tout déchiré le 22 mai à l'Olympia
Pour baptiser le concert mythique avec tout le Secteur Ä
La musique m'a mis official qu'est-ce que j'aurais fait sans elle
J'ai esquivé les plans couchals aujourd'hui j'kiffe grâce à elle

Ky-Ja t'as pris du poids, Ben-J toi t'as encore poussé
Regarde ça se passe tu brilles des pieds à la tête
Blanches baskets, de l'or aux poignets jusqu'aux lunettes Cartier
Pas plus que toi négro respect au Congo
Toutes les rates me parlent de toi et de Bisso Na Bisso
Merci mais dis-leur que je ne suis plus le même
Que depuis, j'ai un fils et aussi une femme qui m'aime
C'est ça, faut construire une famille assurer sa descendance
Même si ce n'est pas encore mon heure t'inquiète chaque jour j'y pense
L'horloge tourne, les jours défilent, les années passent, nos vies changent
On évolue chacun son destin mais surtout chacun sa chance

Le temps passe et passe et passe et beaucoup de choses ont changé
Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant

Ben-J,"Yo this is the Rock kicking it with the Refugee camp
And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
What? I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Yo cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin
Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley
(It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!)

How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54
GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it
Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?
(It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not!)
Man listen, listen
I just got two new Grammy's man
(It doesn't matter about your Grammy's!)

Elle propose un biscuit, on dit non, elle dit si
Elle a retiré tous les miroirs
Elle évite son reflet ne veut plus se voir
Elle vit entourée de photos du passé
Son visage d'alors, son trésor, son trophée
Peau de pêche au tissu tendu de satin
Mais le temps se dépêche et reprend son bien

Les plus jolies fleurs ternissent et se fanent
Les jeunes filles qu'ont de la chance deviennent de vieilles femmes

Sa peau froissée c'est un drap qu'on agrippe
Un mouchoir pour pleurer son mari qui nous quitte
Un trait sur son front pour chacun de ses garçons
Et les paupières fripées, ses enfants qui s'en vont
Ses mains qui se déplient sont des araignées
Qui font peur aux petits mais rassurent leurs aînés

Les traînées aux coins des yeux sont le lit des fleuves
Où s'écoulent peu à peu les larmes des veuves

Elle dit que les années écrivent sur les visages
Et que les ratures encombrent la page
Profitons du beau temps avant l'averse
Elle tue le temps avant l'inverse
Elle refuse et regrette, elle est vieille maintenant
En excuse, elle répète, elle était belle avant

Il me raconte votre vie dans les moindres détails

Vous parliez en experts
Oubliant que dans mes bras

Vous faisiez moins les fiers
Et les autres filles
Perfides petites saintes
M'auraient tondue les cheveux
A une autre époque

J’ai juste les nerfs, j’ai pas dormi

Qui devait divorcer t'avais pas le droit de l'appeler
Il voulait faire les choses bien pour pas que sa femme souffre
Il lui a fait un autre gosse pour sauver son couple et ses pantoufles

T'étais dans la passade du cap de la quarantaine
Mais comme dit ton psy ""c'est 300 francs et à la semaine prochaine!""

Avec tes rêves de midinettes et ton cœur d'artichaut
T'es une porcelaine dans un magasin d'éléphants
Y a pas forcément de prince charmant
Derrière tous les crapauds!

Le printemps dernier ton horoscope était formel
T'allais rencontrer l’âme sœur y avait Mercure dans ton ciel
T'as aimé un capricorne ton signe complémentaire
Il était bisexuel les astres sont parfois tête en l'air

Souviens-toi du connard la brute au grand cœur
Une enfance difficile sûrement battu par son père
Tu trouvais plein d'excuses à ce beau célibataire
Quand il te collait une danse c'était un transfert

Passons sur le macho qui te donnait tout le temps des ordres
Et l'écrivain qu'écrivait rien que tu trouvais génial
Celui qui vendait tes bijoux pour s'acheter sa poudre
Et y a eu moi aussi mais c'est pas pareil

Enfin comme prévu t'es tombé raide dingue de ton psy
C'était l'image du père un complexe œdipien enfoui
Il a gâché votre première nuit qui devait être la plus belle
En débarquant dans la chambre vêtu de porte-jarretelles!

Ça t'as fait un choc tu disais ""les hommes sont tous pourri!""
Mais comme dit ton psy ""prend le fouet il est sous le lit!""",Porcelaine,2004

Je te donnerais bien un somnifère

Bénabar,"Un bébé encadré sur une étagère, 
Un souvenir de vacances, un anniversaire. 
Une fille qui sourit coincée dans un sous-verre, 
Un cadre fantaisie, un bord de mer, 
Et personne ne bouge dans la tribu des yeux rouges, 
Tous différents, les mêmes photos pourtant
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Quelques photos de couple exposées comme des preuves,
Des photos de groupe, des amis qu'on punaise. 
On vérifie d'ailleurs l'air de rien chez les autres, 
Qu'on fait partie des leurs, qu'a côté de leurs têtes y a la nôtre. 
Sur la cheminée du salon des grands-parents, 
Le casting tout entier de tous les petits enfants
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Les albums familiaux sont les manuels d'histoire, 
Qu'on regarde jamais, qu'on réserve au placard. 
Quand il était jeune, quand t'étais petit, 
Quand elle était enceinte, quand ils étaient en vie. 
Portraits de fin d'année des gosses trop bien peignés, 
On dirait vraiment qu'ils ont mangé du ciment
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

La photo censurée, elle s'y trouvait pas belle, 
Aussitôt développée, direct à la poubelle. 
Mignonne en paréo au retour de la plage, 
Elle enlèvera pas le haut, c'est dommage. 
Le portrait qui fait rire du permis de conduire, 
Celui qui fait peur, qu'est-ce que c'est que cette coiffure?
Qu'elles soient en couleur ou bien en noir et blanc, 
On fait tous, quelle horreur ! les mêmes photos tout le temps
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Qu'est-ce qui nous pousse au fond à refaire à la chaîne,
Tous les mêmes photos qu'on a vu par centaines,
Des photos de monuments qui sont jamais très belles, 
Mais c'est nous qui l'a fait, c'est pas la carte postale! 
Les photos de voyage à l'autre bout de la terre, 
Les mêmes paysages, des mêmes belvédères. 
Nous sur un chameau, nous au ski en hiver, 
Re-nous sur un bateau
Et les épices du souk du Caire. 

Re-re-nous à Pâques, y a deux ans déjà, 
Re-re-re-nous à la Toussaint à côté du Etretat. 
C'est vrai qu'on voit pas bien, que la photo est mauvaise, 
Mais par la salle de bain je te jure on devinait les falaises!
Et ces photos souvenirs qu'on stocke acharnés 
Pour pas qu'on puisse nous dire qu'on a pas profité.
Rangées dans un tiroir celles qu'on veut plus voir 
Et classées dans des livres des photos d'archives. 
J'ai encore jamais vu et ça chez personne, 
Sa copine toute nue au dessus du téléphone, 
La photo de son patron dans aucun salon, 
Mais des vues de bords de mer, 
Ah ça putain on sait le faire! 
Qu'on les range en vrac, qu'on les colle au mur, 
Au fond d'un portefeuille ou dans un disque dur, 
Au fin fond de la Creuse, à Paris 16ème, 
On prend les mêmes poses, nos photos sont les mêmes.

L'horizon est bien mort
Dans ses yeux délavés

Assise sur une bitte
D'amarrage, elle pleure

La mer c'est son malheur!

Comme on prend un taxi

Pour voir à chaque étape
Si tous les gars du monde
Veulent bien m'lâcher la grappe

Foutre un peu le boxon

Ne pleure plus mon père

Du sommeil de l'enclume

Qu'est c' que je foutrais là?
Sur un cheval sauvage,
Ils s'en vont ridicules
Dehors y a un orage,
Y sont mouillés c'est nul!

Et tous petits soucis

Ce qu'elle dit de moi
C'est sûrement très tendre,
Enfin bon, j'entends pas
Moi je plante mon hameçon
Tout en haut d'une branche
Je tire sur le nylon,
Me ruine une phalange

Le jour avance un peu,
Mon amour se maquille
Un œil et puis les deux,
C'est futile mais ça brille
Qui veut-elle séduire,
Je suis même pas là
Je me tue à lui dire
Qu'elle est mieux sans tout ça
Que ses yeux sont plus clairs
Quand ils sont dans ma poche
Que vouloir trop plaire
C'est le plaisir des moches
Moi je sors une truite
D'au moins cent vingts kilos
J' l'ai pitié trop petite,
Je la rejette à l'eau

Il est midi passé,
J e reviens les mains vides
Trop de vent, pas assez,
L'eau était trop humide
Alors je rentre chez moi
Triste comme un menhir
Et personne n'est là
Pour m'entendre mentir
Mon amour est partie,
Est partie pour toujours

Dans la salle d'attente où les adultes se préparent 
On chantait dans des bars où les copains avaient le bon goût 
De venir nous voir et d'être autant saouls que nous

Souvent y avait moins de clients qu'on était de musiciens 

On jouait faux bon, d'accord 
Mais au moins on jouait fort 

C'était pas la bohème on n'avait ni faim ni froid 
Un peu perdus quand même ça nous déplaisait pas 
C'était le temps d'avant les selfies, internet 
Celui que les moins de vingt ans ne peuvent pas connaître 
On a fait toutes les conneries qu’on fait à cet âge là 
C'est dur de dire aujourd'hui à mes enfants “ne les faites pas” 

On jouait faux, bon d'accord 
Mais au moins on jouait fort 

De chanson en chanson on m'a fait le tour de la France 
Parce que il y a pas de raison d'épargner la province 
Les filles me tombaient dans les bras j’étais un bourreau des cœurs 
J'avais confiance en moi j'étais sportif et non fumeur 
L'avantage d'écrire ses chansons c'est qu'on raconte ce qu'on veut 
Je parle six langues, je joue du violon, je mesure un mètre quatre-vingt deux

Ihr kennt mein Block
Aber kennt ihr meine Band?
Kennt ihr B-Tight, Mesut, Tony D, MOK, Fumse, Bendt und Werd?

Wenn ich über Homies rede, meine ich nur die einen
Die mich kräftig unterstützen und auch mal nen Fehler verzeihn
Die immer hinter mir stehn, bei jeglichen Schlägerein
Du stehst alleine da und kassierst die Schellen ein
Die Sekte ist mein Fleisch und Blut
Wie Feuer und Glut
Wie Ebbe und Flut
Wie Ehre und Mut
Wie Bong und Sut
Wir sind eine Gruppierung voller Hass und Wut

Ich bin Tony D von der Sekte
Der erste Rapper der checkte
Dass du ein Spast bist
Voll drastisch werd ich gegen Dich vorgehn
Wer wird schon davor stehn
Wenn ich voll abgeh
Mit meinem Totenschläger, Jeah!
Die S E K T E ist die Crew die dich fickt
Wenn es sein muss benutzen wir auch einen spitzen Stift
Drauf geschissen, ob ein Messer am Start ist *Wichser*
Wir sind 8 Homies und kommen mit Benzinkanister

S E K T E geben Platoon
Scheiß auf Bodyguards und Weste
Wenn ich dein Genick breche
Los, los, spring auf mein Boot
Ich hab aufgehört zu kiffen, dafür zieh' ich Koks
Ich bin voll aufgedreht, arrogant und aufgebläht
Kreatin, Kokain, Aggro wie Berlin
Sekten Muzik, die beste Rubrik
Für Unterground Rap
Ich setze auf Sieg

S E K T E

Heißt ich Boxe deine Jungs bis keiner mehr steht
Ich zieh euch alle ab
Stellt euch an wie ein Kunde
Wenn ich mit euch fertig bin, seit ihr arme Hunde
Geld, Handy, Schlagstock; Alles ist meins
Ich gib die ne Kopfnuss und zieh mir rein wie du weinst
Dein Vater heißt Heinz und deine Mutter heißt Manne
Ich reit bei euch ein, und jag euch mit ner Eisenstange

S E K T E steht für Gangsta-Rap und Aggressivität
Wir machen den Rap, so dass die Erde bebt
So wird's auch bleiben bis von uns keiner mehr lebt
Doch freu dich nicht zu früh und reib dir nicht die Hände
Wir sind noch nicht Tod aber schon längst Legende
Unsere Straßenerfahrungen sprechen Bände
Du siehst die Sekte auf MTV und auf Wände

S wie EKTE , I wie ihr kennt den Rest
Komm doch ich fick dich
Du wirst von meiner Band zerfetzt
Ich hasse dreiviertel aller meiner Fans im Netz
Wer noch nie was von der Sekte gehört hat
Kennt sie jetzt, yeah
Fick nicht mit der S E K T E
Ich bin täglich auf den Straßen
Doch dich hab ich nicht gesehen
Wir könnten uns auch Mafia nennen, Armee oder Kartell, yeah
Denn wir ficken jeden, hör gut zu Charnell

Wir sind 8 Nachtgestalten
Sido und die Sekte sind nicht aufzuhalten
Wir sind immer auf Standby und nicht auszuschalten
Unsere Raps sind fresh und eure sind am veralten
Wir verwalten Rap
Gut und das Zahlt sich auch aus *Ding,Ding*
Ich begrühße meine Jungs
Erst der Chaq, dann die Faust
S E K T E heißt wir ficken Dich
Und gehn unseren Weg

Was willst du tun mit zwei gebrochenen Armen?
Ich brech dir auch die Beine und werd dich danach jagen
Was willst du tun, wenn auf einmal der Club brennt?
Deine Ho mit uns abzeckt?
Und mit jedem pennt
Was willst du tun, wenn ich hinter dir steh?
Dir in den Rücken springe und dann den Hals umdreh
Was willst du tun, wenn wir beide blicke ficken?
Ich komm ganz cool auf dich zu und lass mein Stick klicken

Deine kack fresse tut mich schon länger stressen
Doch heute sehn wir uns das erste Mal
Schon vergessen?
Was du damals von dir abgelassen hast, Fotze
Dann zeig mal was du kannst, du solltest nicht so viel protzen

Du bist zum Kotzen
Du scheißt dir ein
Du hast keine Ehre
Fickst deine Mutter wie ein Schwein
Hör auf zu schrein
Du kriegst so wie so nen Tritt
In deine Eier und die Sekte feiert mit

Fumse gibt den Stick
Dieser Typ ist mir zu dick
Ich brauch mindestens 3 Waffen, bis ich ihn runter krieg
Er wird besprungen wie ein Wal
Jeder will ein kleines Stück
Doch er ist Eigentum der Sekte
Wir haben Hunger wie verrückt

Die Sekte zückt die Messer und du flüchtest
Die Sekte ist berühmt und berüchtigt
Du kommst zu spät, wenn du deine Homies retten willst
Die Sekte ist die Crew, die jeden Rapper killed

Wann werdet ihr Spasten es endlich kapier'n
Man kann unseren Style so wie so nicht Kopier'n
Du wirst infiziert von AidS mit Viren
Bei uns gehts ab, wie bei den wilden Tier'n
Wir haben keine Manieren und kein Benehmen
Wir habens nicht gelernt uns wirklich zu schämen
Wir sind wahre Meister im lösen von Problemen
Mesut ist mein Name und die Sekte mein Leben

B-Tight, Mesut, Tony D, MOK, Fumse, Bendt, und Werd in meinem Block
Alle 8 zusammen,die Leute schrei'n verdammt
Die Sekte zieht ne Gras-Wolke durchs Land
Es gibt kaum jemanden der mit uns mithält
Ich hab gehört, das Konkurrenz einen fit hält
Ich scheiß auf dich, wenn du dir dein Maul zerfetzt
Ok, ich mach Musik mit Tomekk und was jetzt?

Où tu vas, beaucoup ont été, mais autant que leurs sourires leur avenir y est resté
ça fait 2-3 Générations qu'on fait les même choses
Pas de la même manière, mais on s'fout en l'air pour les mêmes causes

Hey si t'arrête l'école maintenant, dès maintenant j'peux te raconter
Ce qu'il risque fort de t'arriver Béné!
Tu vas monter une équipe
Un ancien t'avancera de la coke et du shit
Pour la bicrave il t'faudra un terrain
Comme t'es jeune et brave
Tu l'obtiendra à coup de surins
Là, tu prendras la place de mecs qui sont en place depuis trop longtemps
Et qui oublient que le temps passe, mais chacun son temps
Toutes nos légendes sont mortes ou déchues, enfermées ou fichues
Parce que trop d'séjours en prison, trop d'séjours en H.P
Quand j'rap la rue, c'est précis, c'est d'la H.D
Du détail au gros, avec du cran et des gros flingues tu feras des grosses tunes
De la bac aux stups
Victime de ta réput' tout le monde aura un oeil sur ta fortune
T'aura plus besoin de personne pour t'avancer quoi que ce soit
Tu descends en Espagne, qué pasa?
Maintenant c'est toi qui distribues
D'autre attendent dans l'ombre patiemment que tu trébuches!

Ouais ouais, t'inquiète il peuvent toujours attendre ma chute
J'srai toujours à la hauteur de ma réput'
Je serai rusé
J’aurai confiance en personne, sauf en mes associés

Maintenant qu'c'est toi qui distribues
Les enjeux ne sont plus les mêmes, ainsi que les problèmes
Difficile de grimper sans faire du mal à personne
Sans y laisser ta personne, ça personne n'a pu le faire
Un mec refusera de te payer
Tu tiendras à ce qu'il soit le dernier à essayer
Il criera dans tout Paname qu'il t'a banane
Pour que tu récupères ta came il faut que tu le cannes
Quel culot!

J'tuerai personne pour de l'argent
C'est vrai que j'veux des tunes mais j'ai quand même une éducation (bien sûr)
J'suis pas cinglé, j'veux pas me faire épingler à vie
Mais une chose est sûre j'vais pas baltringuer!

Hey, tu penseras ne pas avoir le choix, tu l'feras
Ce que tu feras, c'est que tu l'buteras
Qu'est-ce que tu crois?
Sinon d'autres mecs viendront te racketter
Ta came, tes goves, et les loves que t'a mis de côté!
Tu tiendras trop à ta réputation d'homme d'action
Donc tu passeras à l'action ça se fera en une fraction de seconde
Mortelle sera la sanction pour ceux qui restent en vie et envient ton ascension
Ta côte va grimper, et même chez les condés
Ton dossier và changer de fichier
Fiché au grand banditisme
T'imagines bien que la fin sera triste
Tu te feras balancer, sur un coup de fil anonyme
Stoppé dans ta lancée
Sur un retour d'Espagne tu te feras levé, chargé
Le pire c'est que même tes potes vont te charger
Commission rogatoire, écoutes
T'as beau mettre toutes thunes dans le baveux, écoute!
Tu feras dix ans plein, même primaires
T'effectueras ta peine même si tu pleures des rivières!
Seule ta mère va t'assister
Après un an ou deux, tous tes potes vont se désister
Allez, peut-être qu'un seul te restera fidèle
C'est lui qui t'apprendra que ta meuf t'es infidèle
Tu vas péter les plombs, bloqué derrière les barreaux
Sortir au bout de dix ans, usé, au bout du rouleau
Avec une longue liste de comptes à régler
Mais les mecs de ton équipes se sont fait flinguer!
Ils se sont fait dépassés par des petits jeunes ambitieux
Braves comme toi à l'époque, et encore plus vicieux
Pour pouvoir te refaire
Qu'est-ce tu pourra faire?
A part monter sur un braquo, mais sa te coutera cher
Khey, parce que la prochaine fois c'est vingt ans
T'es dedans car maintenant t'a aucune qualification
T'auras palpé trop d'fric pour pouvoir accepter de bosser pour l'SMIC
Tu seras pris dans la spirale tu te rappellera mes paroles
Tu envieras ceux qui auront poursuivis l'école
Il sera trop tard, ce qui est fait est fait

I can't be alive not without you.

All I wanted to do was to heal your wounds.
I wanted you to see the beauty I see in you.
But you were never willing to comprehend.

You were never alone in this. I'm always willing to be.
You were never alone in this. I was willing to be by your side.

You always said, for the fight you'd be standing on the front lines.
Where your heart is you'll find your treasure.
Now it seems, I don't know, where your heart was at the whole time?
You never had to be alone through this and you know it.
I was always standing by your side.

Let me in your arms. Let me be your first. Let me share your pain.

Can you just let me in?

I always wondered 'bout that look in your eyes,
so cold with no emotion
(It started from the moment when I entered your room)
and your hands at your side.
You can't hide from me ya know that I've been reading your mind,
(Saw the roses which yet haven't bloomed)
And its been telling me a story of an unhappy life.
So full of pain & so full of regret,
(I saw the gleam from the razor upon your wrist)
you left a message on my pillow that said ""Never forget me""
I know you're so afraid of opening up,
but I'm begging on my knees, can you just let me in?

No place to hide, there's no escaping this
Go bury yourself into your Holy Book
Admiring a God for which you desperately seek

What the hell have we done to deserve this?
Living with a fear of not knowing what happens next
I don't want your apostle, I've had enough of the martyr
It's either die or pay the fine

In God we trust, fuck that and fuck you
You stand there with pointed fingers
Preaching for me to be open to your fake beliefs
Don't you realize that life isn't based on make believe?

I know you try to play God
If that's the case I will be your devil

I don't want your apostle, I've had enough of the martyr
It's either die or pay the fine
I don't want your approval, I don't want to be saved
And this judgment is the crime

I wonder if she's feeling well

And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou

Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers

Please let me through!

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

She doesn't quite fit in

A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

Transcend the Rubicon
Suffering, torment, anguish, pain
At life's shore slowly breaks the waves
Turn of the tides, revenance of rage
Blistering so were the thoughts
When shackled to a wall
Flagrant ways of conformation
Your death sentence appalled
Now plead for a worthless life
Deny us for your guilt
Escape within the stoney tomb
Which you yourself have built
Independence of a drug
To satisfy the need
Orgies filled with travesty
To sow all mocking seeds
Originality the one
Who's screaming at the crime
Sinister the ways of wisdom
Expand or face the fire
Sterile splinter of self doubt
Thorn in your boney hide
Counterfeit within adept
Colossal is the pride
Breeding cynicism
Grandeur crying in your face
Overture derisive laughter
Hateful human race
Incantation of your thoughts
Upon this mortal coil
Open wide the jaws of hate
Serving them so loyal
Reeking contradiction
When you're laughing as you fail
Believing in your innocence
Tells a sorrowed tale
Autumn fall upon a life
This season at an end
Darkened shadows all around
And yet without a friend
Realisation dawns on you
It's time for you to face
Hateful human race

Benediction,"Dedicated to Julian May, author of ""The Many Coloured Land(The Saga of the Exiles in the Pliocene epoch)
The rupture of the brain from flesh, children of the black.
Devouring mother, call her blessed, with impetus they lack.
Glorified spineless triumph, sick polluted mind.
Grusome child in void, evolution of humankind.
Operant child in unity. Unseen, unheard this day.
Floating mind is veiled in blood, the body is taken away.
Stripped of appendages, ungiven choice.
Awaiting intervention, mind without a voice.
Mentally amplify, cerebral lustrate.
Life after bodily death, brain without a face.
Black mother feeds the rancourous scorn, sinful propagate.
Metaphysically entity, redact, coerce, farsense, create.
Infinite years, immortality chained. Aeons herein encased.
Artificial, surrogate overt inhuman waste.
Divorced from purile emotion, hidden humanity,
Body, a cremated epitaph. Torso innutility.
Utterance of death's blessing. Funeral absent dream.
Muted in a voiceless uproar, deafened to hear her screams.
Banished to an exile life, prisoner of the brain.
Mind enhancer switches in, with unrelenting pain.
Bodiless mentally, The twisted saint began.
Spawned inside a sterile womb, nurturing the mental man.
",Ashen Epitaph [#],1994
Benediction,"Inner deformity, such a foul deceptive rot.
Conceiving the grotesque. Nothing is but what is not.
Screeds of verbiage, never explained. Gazing at the flames.
Inside the dungeon or my skull, only mawkish thoughts remains.
Grotesque addict, forever shadowed,
Darkness clouding me. Absurdity now fate.
Bizzarre dreams, an horrendous nightmare,
Nothing left but to hallucinate.
Dementia reigns, a predilection. Total order cease.
Rescrudescent, this condition. Coherency decrease.
Humanity is not to shine, in my bloodless face.
Magnified in travesty, I have been displaced.
See with the eye of the mind. That the lie will speak.
Traumatic cracks in my addiction, made the future bleak.
Paralysed to ruminate, embolismic bitter jest.
Ontologically I'm dead, reborn as the grotesque.

You think you're safe? you cannot hide
Deep within? see what's inside
Dysfunctional civility
Ultraviolet dream

So polite, so fair to all
You've just so fucked up
Withered and small
Doff the hat, play the game
While all the time you're playing just for your own gain

Aggressive creature, you're not so divine
Open your heart to the killer inside
Lex Talionis inside you keep
Laughing as your enemies weep

Revealing in what lies beneath

Settle the score

Hide your face from the mirror, avoid the truth

And to the beast inside you yield!",Don't Look in the Mirror,2001

Of what I have to give
Temptation can be so sweet
To feel what it's like to truly live

All the depravity
All the crime and sin
But when it's over you'll be begging me
To push the needle in

Drift away, float from the world
No one really cares

Pleasure pain, there's just no divide
Beyond the limits of the human mind
Just one more time, it's really making sense
Ruinous, yet so immense

Dreaming as you gasp for air
Fall away from a life of care
Sink into a lifeless state
The greatest high to recreate
There's poison flowing through your veins
Some choices when they've made can't be erased
Try to forget yourself
And so shall the world

The sweetest pain is no divine
Perception's depth in slow decline
Take the hit, get the high
Take the easy way to die

Benediction,"In a world of no ones
I'll be the freak
Turn and hide from the mask you see
Misshapen face of fear

I will be your obscenity
I will be the depraved
I will be your deepest fear
That lights the dark that you so crave

Created in honor, in honor to live
Invisible, terror descends
The deepest fear come true
One false move and you know you'll fall
The abyss of nightmares gapes below you

Hideous to look upon
A deformed face, a bastard son
A pantomime, a colorful tale
Yet in this theater, no beauty prevails

How could they do this to me?
My Lord, he never cared
Screaming for help and I was not saved
Tried to trust but I found despair

They have despised me since the day I was born
Reviled by truth, their minds too small
Tearing open blinded sightless eyes
Only death is real the true demise

Unquenchable thirst never slaked
Set loose the storm within me
It rages on

I'll obliterate all you doubters
With my hammers of twisted truth
Drive the nails deeper into your hands
Feed the sickness, destroying you

Vomit the beast upon the unsuspecting world
Surprise on their faces is joy to behold
Try to silence me, but killing me now won't work
Eternal heretics forever speak

I am the disease
I am that which rots inside
Festering within
There is no cure for my plague

And though I die in vain
I die with open eyes
Take the grave this sight from me
Sweet silence of the obscene

Rejection relived within

To teach these poor lost souls to die

There a moment of stillness before the attack
Silence surrounds and invades me
I have had vision, men covered in blood
Stigmata their hands and feet bleed

A terrifying sight, but my heart is galvanized
The will of the Lord becomes clear
In her panic stricken, pleading eyes

Please don't cry, child, it can't be helped
I do this because I must
You blood will cleanse the souls of mankind
And your body cleans me of my lust

There dwelt a force within the abscess
That you called fear

In the walls you've built around your feeble mind
I'll sleep through the cracks

Ghastly automaton exacerbates your plight
Your suffering feeds me!

Now we, we are become the force
The denotative urge
Irrepressible the slayers revolt
Oh how this worms have turned
Forever repressed, imprisoned for being born
Antimony incarnate
The bastard, prodigal son returns
Bearing gifts to decimate

No more the false enlightenment
Only your death
Revealed
Blood seeking redress
You cry out all you like
There's no one to care
Rotting in a prison that you built from lies

Revisiting your crimes at source
With not a shred of regret
You brought this torture upon yourself

So much time ahead
So much that can be done

Now boiling molten steel!

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you,

Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Bengt Hallberg,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Pining to be sweetly reclining

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Bengt Hanson,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do

Bengt Hanson,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1996

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

find the empty space
I try to get to sleep again,
and imagine you're here
I thought I heard you
whispering my name
I try to reach my arms to you
But you're not there
Then I realize it's just a dream
I have to face another day,
the night is over
Sun shines through my window
now I see
I have to face the truth again,
that you're really gone
How should I know
why everything's the same
When I can't hold you, kiss you,
hear you say you love me too
There's no way that I could
erase all the memories of you
I keep inside, all of the time
Cause they show how
I'm still in love with you
Your love's forever

I can see you by my side

what else can I do?
It doesn't bother me at all
How many seasons fall
You'll always be here

If you ever asked me to, someday
Maybe I'd be strong enough
to get over you
I'd rather spend my nights
and my days
With all the pain and the regret
Just crying over you
How should I understand
how life goes on
Without you I won't last a day,
remember how we used to pray
I wish that I could just forget
and set my heart free

I don't know why

on the rooftop
As we're cruising
the city streets
Don't care how crazy
the world seems outside
Cause I got you next to me
There were times
I was too shy to say it
How you're taking over my mind
But I know I'm not the only one
Cause you bring that
feeling back to me
Seems so right,
like this was meant to be
(You make me feel brand new)
Cried lonely nights,
but now you're all I see
(And I wanna love that's
brand new)
When we kiss,
it's gonna be so sweet
The kinda kiss that
knocks you down oh so softly
Won't say a word,
cause they don't mean a thing
Stay with me now
and don't let go
You gave me strength,
the strength I needed
To give you everything
my heart's been hiding
So this is
how I want you to feel it

unhappy endings,
That brings the joy
to brand new days

just can't be explained

was changing all along
