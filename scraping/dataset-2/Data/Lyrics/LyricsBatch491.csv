Johnnie Ray,"All dolled up in your glad rags,
But tomorrow may turn to sad rags,
And they call you Glad Rag Doll!

I know that you're admired,
I know that you're desired
But only by the fellows who soon grow tired,
My poor little Glad Rag Doll!

You're just a pretty little toy the boys like to play with,
You're not the kind that they choose to grow old and grey with!

Now don't you make this, this the end dear,
It's never too late to make amends dear,
My poor little Glad Rag Doll!

You're just a pretty little toy the boys like to play with,
You're not the kind
They have on their mind,
You're just a toy for them today,
So listen to the things I say!

Now don't you make this, this the end dear,
It's never too late to make amends dear,
My poor little Glad Rag Doll!","Glad, Rag Doll",2006
Johnnie Ray,"Talk to her please, Mr. Sun
Speak to her, Mr. Rainbow
And take her under your branches, Mr. Tree

Whisper to her, Mr. Wind
Sing to her, Mr. Robin
And Mrs. Moonlight, put in a word for me

Tell her how I feel
It shouldn't end this way
Since you are all her friends
She'll listen to whatever you have to say

Babble to her, Mr. Brook
Kiss her for me, Miss Raindrop
And watch to see they all do, please Mr. Sun

Babble to her, Mr. Brook
Kiss her for me, Miss Raindrop
And watch to see they all do, please Mr. Sun",Please Mr. Sun,2006

Johnnie Ray,"Lullaby and good night
With roses bedight
Creep into thy bed
There pillow thy head
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break

Lullaby and good night
Those blue eyes close tight
Bright angels are near
So sleep without fear
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm",Brahms' Lullaby (Close Your Eyes),2007
Johnnie Ray,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go

Just me and my radio

Johnnie Ray,"It's impossible to tell the sun to leave the sky,
It's just impossible.
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry,
It's just impossible.
Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you going through me,
But the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible.

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible.
If I had you could I ever ask for more
It's just impossible.
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible.
If I had you could I ever ask for more

Johnnie Ray,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky

Johnnie Ray,"When the midnight choo choo leaves for Alabam'
I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam'! Alabam'!""

That's where you stop your train, that brings me back again 
Down home where I'll remain, where my honey lamb am

Johnnie Ray,"Such a night
It was a night, ooo what a night it was 
It really was, such a night
The moon was bright ooo how bright it was
It really was, such a night
The night was alive with stars above
And when she kissed me I had to fall in love

It was a kiss mmmm what a kiss it was
It really was, such a kiss
How she could kiss ooo what a kiss it was
It really was, such a kiss
Just part of her lips that sets me on fire
I reminisce and I feel desire

I'd give my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember , I'll always remember
Ooo that night, ooo what a night it was 
It really was, such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and my love and the night was gone
But I'll never forget that kiss in the moonlight
Ooo such a kiss, ooo such a night

Now she's gone, gone gone
Yes she's gone, gone gone
Came the dawn, dawn dawn
And the night was gone
And my heart was gone
And her love was gone
But before the dawn oo oo oo oo such a night",Destiny,2017

Seems we can't get along,
No matter what I do
I don't appeal to you

I am right or wrong

This much you can do

Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Oh, Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice
We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1966

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And you're probably gonna write what you didn't see

Can you please respect my privacy

Why can't you just let me
Do the things I wanna do
I just wanna be me
I don't understand why
Would you wanna bring me down

I'm sick of being followed

Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing ""A Change Gonna Come""
Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay

There was a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

Train & Miles (J. Coltrane,  took mean solo
Jr. Walker had 'em dancing in the isles
They stood up when Jackie sang ""Lonley Teardrops""
When Sammy (Davis, Jr.) danced, the crowd went wild
I think I saw Ella standing with Mahalia
Backstage with Elvis with his blue suede shoes
It started raining, everybody just stayed there
To hear Z.Z. sing the ""Down Home Blues""

The great Al Jackson was a holding down the beat
When Marvin sang ""Let's Get It On"", they jumped to
their feet
Everyone started screaming and gave a standing ovation
When the curtain came up with the mighty Temptations
King Curtis blew the ""Soul Serenade""
Thought I saw Lady Day (B. Holiday) sittin' in the
shade
I got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Lord I love the way sweet Mary (Wells) sings
It was getting kinda late, it was time to go
Tupac and Biggie (Smalls), they closed the show
(Boo!)
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time

The weight of the world is on my shoulders
And it's all in vain

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

Still hears my broken song of love

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,

Johnny Barnes,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Johnny Bond,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a four-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension.  Man!  What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,1973

Left her cryin' in the rain,
I told her that I made my mind up,
I didn't want to see her again.

What makes the night so long?

That's done a good woman wrong.

I can't sleep....

Told her that she played around,

Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X

That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

Waiting for a crew of men so she can make her trip 
Out searching was the best gang that everyone knew well 
A-searchin' the streets & gutters so the Defiant could set sail 

The captain ordered to see the men to pick them for his crew 
Called for headstruck daughters but for all the good men too 
Out to sail this morning, Italy was her destiny 
To escort back a convoy that was helpless on the sea 

CHORUS: 
The HMS Defiant sailed to live up to her name 
There was no word of mutiny aboard, but who was there to blame? 

The Defiant reached its destiny, no timber ships in sight 
So returning home, the French approached; the Defiant had to fight 
She captured herself a vessel with a chest of jewels aboard 
Along with the Frenchmen who advised Napoleon under his sword 

With Captain Culvert wounded was there not a man to care

And a great multitude was gathered there without a thing to eat for days 
Up stepped a little boy with the basket please take it Lord he said 
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes five thousand had fish and bread 
Who was it everybody (it was Jesus) who was it everybody (it was Jesus) 
Who was it everybody (it was Jesus) it was Jesus Christ our Lord 
Now pay close attention little children it's somebody you ought to know 
It's all about a man that walked on earth nearly two thousand years ago 
Well he healed the sick and afflicted it and he raised 'em from the dead 
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross and put thorns on his head 
Who was it everybody
Well they took him down and they buried him and after the third day 
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone 
Cause the stone was rolled away 
He's not here for he is risen the angel of the Lord then said 
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands 
They knew he came back from the dead 
Who was it everybody",It Was Jesus (With Background Choir),
Johnny Cash,"I just don't like this kind of livin' I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
I give my all and sit and yearn and get no lovin' in return
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

Why do we stay together if we always fuss and fight
You ain't never done to be wrong and I ain't never been right
Tell me where you think we're goin' cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
When things go wrong you go your way you leave me here to pay and pay
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

I just don't like the things you're doin' your evil heart will be your ruin
When things start runnin' smooth and free you haul right off and you pick on me
And I just don't like this way of livin'

They say the road of love is long it's rocky and it's rough
But if this road don't start to get smooth I've traveled it long enough
Why don't you act a little older and get that chip off of your shoulder
I told you once now I'll tell you twice you better start to treat me nice
Cause I just don't like this kind of livin'",I Just Don't Like This Kind Of Livin',
Johnny Cash,"Always alone alone and blue I've got no one to tell my troubles to
No one to care to call my own it seems that I must always be alone

The day you left you broke my heart I need you so but we're so far apart
You didn't care I should have known that you would go and leave me all alone

There is no one to take your place each night in dreams I see your smiling face
Then I awake and find you gone I know that I must always be alone",Always Alone,
Johnny Cash,"I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies 
And I couldn't keep from crying 
You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me 
And I couldn't keep from crying 
I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms 
Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place 
I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss 
And I couldn't keep from crying 

I saw his eyes drinking your charms...",I Couldn't Keep from Crying,
Johnny Cash,"I love you because you understand dear
Every single thing I try to do.

I love you for the way you never doubt me.

You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top and drink cool H2O

Johnny Cash,"Well, I took my Ruby jukin' on the out-skirts of town
She took her high heels off and rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox to get a little beat
Everybody started watchin', all the rhythm in her feet

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

Now, Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop, she rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor, and everybody yelled
""Ruby, rock some more""

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

It was 'round about four, I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then she looked at the clock
She said, ""Wait a minute, Daddy
Now don't get sour, all I want to do
Is rock a little bit more""

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

One night, my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said, ""Leave me alone, Daddy
'Cause your Ruby wants to rock""

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'

Don't cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Got me a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day

Johnny Cash,"Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all its land
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall
He had concubines and wives
He called his Babylon ""Paradise"" 
On his throne he drank and ate 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time
All holy things they scorned and mocked 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand 
Nothin' else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood 
Belshazzar asked him what it said 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your houses are built upon the sand""",Belshazzar,

Johnny Cash,"My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same

It's hard to do but I must try

You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day:

And no one else could come between.
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him she slapped him a time or two
She said I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you

Shelter it from harm along life's way

You have but to speak and my heart will obey

But who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies 
Once I was a young man dashing with the girls 
Now no one wants an old man I lost my handsome curls 
But I want to say when my time comes lay me facing the rising sun 
Put me in the corner where where I buried my pup 
Tell the preacher to pray then cover me up 
Don't lay flowers where my head should be maybe God let some grow for me 
And all the little children that I love like my own 
Will they be sorry that old John's gone

She knew that Cody was the man she wanted but she had waited nearly all her life 
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye 
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife (don't you worry) Clementine 
Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan 
He told 'em this would be his last carousing 

I'm gonna settle down boys if I can (with my darling) Clementine 
Someone said it must have been past midnight when Cody had to face a jealous man 
Another story goes that no one really knows 
But it seems there was a dancehall girl called Nan (don't you tell) Clementine 
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room 
Then there was a silence in the place 

Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down 
They found Cody lying on his face (softly calling) Clementine

Johnny Cash,"We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt

""Don't step on Mother's roses,"" Daddy cried
""She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place""

""Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow""

Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say

""Don't step on Mother's roses,"" Daddy cried
""She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place""

",Mr. Lonesome,1962
Johnny Cash,"You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)

I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart

""I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I""

Did they not stray did little lambs weep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep

Pack your bags and pull out this evenin?

And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

there's a wide open road
It?s leadin? south from my abode
If you stick around and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin? for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went
Down that wide open road

If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go

Johnny Cash,"Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
Could a land know such a people
As the pioneer, the cowboy
His clothes, his conversation, his unique brand of lingo

All his devil deeds of daring
His hat, his bandana, the dirty boots
And ragged chaps
But mainly that sixgun dangling

So his hand could get it quickly
But draw your own conclusions
Lean to your own understandings
Your beliefs and your convictions

Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds
And songs and legends
But I ask you if you do be sure
You've walked in many moccasins

Over many, many pathways
And that you have listened carefully
Really listened to the west wind
And to everything it whispers

And then go back and listen, listen to this once more
To these legends and traditions
They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
Just ponder on the things that happened

As we gaze so very deeply
In the time and place and persons
Seeing now and then the West as it really was
And to tell you of a little that we saw there

And looking backward through a century
There was the True West there was the Real True West
Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
And saw it as we saw it

And heard that west wind screaming, shouting almost speaking
Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
And the legends and traditions

Through the wind that breeze these tales
Of the ones who never made it
Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys, snow and hunger
They went westward, westward, westward

Here they come a smokin' fire boys you better earn your hire
Stampede and hell to score

We drank and fought and partnered back to back at troubles start
We heard the call on evening in the thunder and the black
When the lightnin' hit the leaders and the devil led the pack

Stampede they're comin' up to draw...

Our horses they were handy for we had just rode in
We went from drinkin' coffee to thinkin' of our sins
There wasn't time for prayin' there was hardly time to cuss
It was a smokin' roarin' rattle and the leaders were on us

Stampede they're comin' up to draw

Old Frank's foot it missed the stirrup and his hand it missed the horn
And as the cattle crossed him from his body life was torn
I was mounted and a ridin' when I heard his final yell
Said hey Johnny head the wild bunch and do the ladies well

Stampede they're comin' up to draw

No I ain't got no partner cause old Frank's done dead and gone
But just so he'd be remembered Peter put him in this song

Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Well, I was as innocent as I could be

With the rose so red and the lilies so fair
And the mirltes so bright with the emerald dew

I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portions of love had all blown away

Oh she taught me to love her and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
She left me no warning no words of farewell

Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll love you but no one will ever know

And that I was glad the day you set me free

Johnny Cash,"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

And if I've met someone who thrills me so
Well, I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
I'll tell you about her, for you ought to know

You comb her hair every mornin'
And make sure she's dressed just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed every night

When she's around me, sometimes I can hardly speak
I stammer and I walk right into doors
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
Oh, you know her, honey, don't you know it's you

You comb her hair every mornin'
And make sure she's dressed just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed every night",You Comb Her Hair,1966
Johnny Cash,"There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Lord my hands feel like they're froze and there's a numbness in my toes
But it's only seven miles to Mary Anne it's only seven miles to Mary Anne

You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that northern sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Mary Anne it's only five more miles to Mary Anne

That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's screams
And we'd best be movin' faster if we can
Dan just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Mary Anne it's only three more miles to Mary Anne

Come on Dan get up your ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you if I can
All right Dan perhaps it's best we'll just stop awhile and rest
For it's still another mile to Mary Anne it's still another mile to Mary Anne

Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He made it but he couldn't leave ol' Dan
Yes they found him on the plains his hands froze into the reins
He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne
He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne",Blizzard,1966
Johnny Cash,"'Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On the bloody ground at the close of day

Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a narrow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
Where there's not a soul that will care for me
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie

",Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie,1966
Johnny Cash,"I ride an old paint, I lead an old Dan
I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley ann
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

Well John's had two daughters and the song
One went to Denver the other went wrong
His young wife died in a poolroom fight
But he tries to keep singing from morning till night

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

When I die take my saddle from the wall
Strap it my pony, lead him out of the stall
Throw my bones on his back, turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go
",I Ride an Old Paint,1966
Johnny Cash,"The devil in hell, we're told was chained
A thousand years he there remained
He neither complain nor did he groan but
Was determined to start a hell of his own

Where he could torment the souls of men
Without being chained in a prison pen
So he asked the lord if he had on hand
Anything left when he made this land

The Lord said yes, there's a plenty on hand
But I left it down by the Rio Grande
The fact is ol' boy, the stuff is so poor
I don't think you could use it as the hell anymore

But the devil went down to look at the truck
And said if he took it as a gift he was stuck
For after lookin' that over carefully and well
He said this place is too dry for hell

But in order to get it off his hands
The Lord promised the devil to water the land
So trade was closed and deed was given
And the Lord went back to his home in heaven

And the devil said, now I got all what's needed
To make a good hell and he succeeded
He began by putting thorns all over the trees
He mixed up the sand with millions of fleas

He scattered tarantulas along the road
Put thorns on cactus and horns on toads
Lengthened the horns of the Texas steer
Put an addition to the rabbit's ear

Put a little devil in the bronco steed
And poisoned the feet of the centipede
The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion stings
The mosquito delights you with his buzzing wings

The sunbursts are there and so the ants
And if you sit down
You'll need to have soles on your pants
The wild boar rooms on a high chapparel

It's a hell of a place that he has for hell
The heat in the summers are hundred and ten
Too hot for the devil, too hot for men
The red pepper grows upon the banks of the brook

The Mexican use it in all that he cook
Just dine in with one of 'em and you're bound to shout
I've hell on the inside as well as it out
My hands are calloused July to July

I use a Big Dipper to navigate by
Fight off the wolves who drink from my well
So I have to be mean as hell
A sheep-herder came and put up the fence

I saw him one day but I ain't seen him since
But if you need a mutton we got mutton to sell
We're cowpunchers and we're mean as hell
Neither me nor my pony's got a pedigree

But he takes me where I'm wantin' to be
I'll ride him to death and when he has fell
I'll get me another one mean as hell
I shot me a calf and I cut off her head

'Cause the boys in the bunkhouse are waitin' to be fed
They rise in chime with the five thirty bell
And the best one of any of 'em is mean as hell",Mean as Hell,1966

My brother run out and come back in all excited

And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr Garfield been shot down low

And I said mam what was it that happened mam and she said

Well everybody drifted off toward home finally

And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low

I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)

Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife

Don't pull in single harness all your life)

That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'

The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low

Who crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
Two yoke of oxen a big yeller dog
A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

One evenin' quite early they camped on the plat
Down by the road on a green shady flat
Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose
And Ike he just gazed on his Pike County rose

Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
Down in the sand she lay rollin' about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
He said, ""Betsy get up, you'll get sand in your eyes""

Well the Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that mornin' was fried
Ike he got discouraged and Betsy got mad
The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad

Well a miner said, ""Betsy will you dance with me""
""I will now old Hoss if you don't make too free
But don't dance me hard do you want to know why
Doggone you I'm chocked full of strong alkali""

Ike and sweet Betsy got married ofcourse
But Ike gettin' jealous obtained the divorce
Betsy well satisfied said with a shout
""Goodbye you big lummox, I'm glad you backed out""

He said ""Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you,"" Said ""Listen boy
Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to.""

John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
He said, ""I'll pay you a quarter at a time starting tomorrow
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line.""

I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?"" and he said,
""I can hoist a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.""
He said ""Can you swing a hammer"" He said ""do anything you hire me to.""

""Now ain't you something! So high and mighty with all that muscle!""
Go ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, and show me what you can do!""

He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
Pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do

With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
John Henry raised it back 'til it touched his heels then
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two

The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
To watch make the cold-steel ring ""Lord! What a swinger!
Watch him make the cold-steel ring""

But the bad boss came up laughin' at John Henry
He said, ""You full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
We gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin'
Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you.""

John Henry said, ""I feed four little brothers
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of the livin'?
And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
Do engines get rewarded for their steam?

John Henry said to his captain said ""A man ain't nothin' but a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill ""How is you?
Said pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.
I said how are you Huh?
Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.

Two-thousand people hollered, ""Go John Henry!""
Then somebody hollered,"" The mountain's cavin' in!""
John Henry told the captin, ""Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.

""Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills""

Now, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
Early next mornin' he said,
""Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
Said you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up
And I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up
That I couldn't come up with it
He said, (dirty mind),
He said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
And when you swinging with that lead man
You tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,
I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats,
When they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.
They say,""Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger.""
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
Clickity clack

Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man

Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man

Yonder lies a steel-drivin'

Thank you very much
You know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia
Digin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.
And he was a mighty big man they say
That from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet
Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke",The Legend of John Henry's Hammer [#][*],1968
Johnny Cash,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds	
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues [Live] [Live],1968
Johnny Cash,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

[Chorus:]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

I'll miss you more than a brother when you go when you go
If only I had not tried to escape
They'd barred me with you I know yes I know

Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
And don't let them know I never will be free be free
Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
And send a picture of mother back to me

Say hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
But stay with me just another minute or so or so

Johnny Cash,"A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry, ""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Her mother wiped the tears and said, ""See honey, you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay""
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine, ""Call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""
",Call Daddy from the Mines,1968
Johnny Cash,"Cisco Clifton had a fillin' station
About a mile and a half from town
Most cars passed unless they were out of gas
So Cisco was always around

Regular gas was all that it sold
Except tobacco matches and oil
Other than that he fixed lots of flats
Keepin' Cisco rough hands soiled

He'd wipe the gas and check the air
In a hundred times a day
He patiently gave directions
On how to get to the state highway

Usually he'd give 'em water
Or a tyre or two some air
And once a big black Cadillac
Spent seven dollars there

He'd give anybody anything they'd ask
And lend anything he had
His tools are tyres bumper jacks or wire
To the good ones or the bad

In wintertime there was a depot stove
And a table for a checker game
And every mornin' at sunup
The same checker players came

So Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
Was always in the red
Personal loans were personally gone
But never a word was said

One mornin' at eight, them checker players
Heard a big bulldozer roar like a freight
And Cisco said I hope my kids stay fed
When they build that Interstate

He'd managed to pay for property
Where his little fillin' station sat
And friends still came for checker game
So Cisco settled for that

He wouldn't say so but Cisco knew
That the Interstate was too much to fight
But to keep his will and to pay his bills
He did odd jobs at night

He still opened up at sunrise
And the checker game went on
The cars flew past on highest gas
And the neighbors had sold out and gone

If a car ever did go by he was lost
And if they stopped they were treated the same
So at Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
There's a howdy and a checker game",Cisco Clifton's Fillin' Station,1968
Johnny Cash,"While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed

Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead

Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night

I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through

In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust",The Flint Arrowhead,1968

She could a run right on the Georgia Sea
But she cut right back through Tennessee

And every day was slow to go

It's been a mighty lonely year

Every mile I needed you
I kinda hope that you needed me too
Everywhere I saw your face around

This old familiar place welcomed me again
Back to where I belonged
To be back to you and Tennessee
Back to you and Tennessee

Beside the Cumberland River
Where the grass is soft and sweet
We ran across the fields of cedar
Hiding from the noisy streets

And when the leaves fell from the cold
The stars were silver the moon was gold

I'm planting my roots in this ground

And when they look for me I'll be found
With something that is part of me

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines

Well, I dreamed, I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream

Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while, I set me down a while

You dreamer you

Well, I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream

I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir, calm yourself a bit""

I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me

But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir, live upon the earth""

Johnny Cash,"Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
And His hands could join a table true enough to stand forever
And He might have spun His life out in the coolness of the morning
But He put aside His tools and He walked the burning highways
And He built His house from people just like these

And He found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And He found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind Him emptied
He put aside His tools and stopped to touch the dying
And He built His house from people just like these

It was on a storming Sunday when He rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before Him
Were like the crimes they laid against Him
It was on a storming Friday when He climbed the streets to Calvary
And where He died today why they're selling beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago

But would He stand today upon the sands of California
And walk the sweating blacktop of New York and Mississippi?
Would He be a guest on Sunday, a vagrant on a Monday?
With the doors locked tight against His kind you know

Oh, come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent, cathedrals to our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't You come and build a house on rock again

Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
And His hands could form a table true enough to stand forever

Johnny Cash,"And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil.

It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row.
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold.
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul.
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar.

My thirsty wanted whisky; my hungry needed beans,
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream.
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams,
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar.

Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern:
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor;
Friendly shadows.

I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar.
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar.
An' he turned and said: ""Come up here boy, and show us what you are.""
I said: ""I'm dry."" He bought me a beer.

He nodded at my guitar and said: ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him. He said: ""You ain't makin' any money, are you?""
I said: ""You've been readin' my mail.""
He just smiled and said: ""Let me see that guitar.
""I've got something you oughta hear.""
Then he laid it on me:

""If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,
""To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.
""And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,
""Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?""

There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind,
Who were crucified for what they tried to show.
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time.
'Cause the truth remains that no-one wants to know.

Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before,
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door.
When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor,
And lonesome was more than a state of mind.

You see, the devil haunts a hungry man,
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him.
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing.
Then I stole his song.

And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen,
To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear.
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about,
Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care.

I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same,
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul.
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed.
'Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to know.",To Beat the Devil,1969

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota.
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis, later on down the river.
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
Raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.

Appreciate a little help on guitar, alright. Thank you Carl

Well,my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do
Now you're gonna die""

(yeah, that's what I told him)

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""

Well what could I do? What could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my Pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..
Bill or George! Any-damn-thing but Sue!

With a tape recorder
We took it with us
And there are some things in this world
That everyone wants to see or hear at one time or anther in their life
And especially for you fellas, I think it's
We feel real good that we can bring back sounds of the people and the places
I know a lot of you are just like I was
They were always dear to you, the stories and the songs about Israel

We went to Jerusalem, the way of the cross, went to the wailing wall

We went into the little town of town of Kayna
Just over the hills from Nazareth
And there's a church that sits over the sis-turn where the water came from
That Christ turned to wine where the first miracle was performed
We went into the church, saw the sis-turns,
You could hear the sounds of the water in there
Hear the Echo
I was so impressed when I came out of the church, if I ever had an inspiration
And I had one then
From seeing what I had just seen and heard
And I said under my breath ""He turned the water, into wine of all things""
On the way to Tiberius, in the car
In the next few minutes, I wrote this song

He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Canan town the word went all around that
He turned the water into wine

Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and
Walked upon the Sea of Galilee

He turned the water into wine he did my lord now,
He turned the water into wine
In the little Canan town, the word went all around that
He turned the water into wine

He fed the hungry multitude (didn't he brother)
He fed the hungry multitude.
With a little bit of fish and bread,
They said every one was fed, (5000)
He fed the hungry multitude.

Johnny Cash,"I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay 
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the barren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon

I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon

South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodigal returning to the girl in Saskatoon

Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lilies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon

My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wanderlust was stifled
By possession of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon",Girl in Saskatoon,1969

She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl 
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl 

She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world

It was just another day
But her sweetheart and his buddies
Died ten thousand miles away

A Captain sadly walked the muddy bloody battlefield
The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the Captain had his orders, so the roll call begin

Atkins Baker, Carter Calahan, Clement Jones, Johnson Moran
McCoy, Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd, Thomas Wilson
What can of you here

The roll call was completed but no sign of life was there
Not one man had answered not one accounted for
He turned around and he walked away and looked up to the sky
When he heard his own voice echo and the answer from on high

I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss

Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman 
He grew up in another small village 
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter 

Then for three years he was a traveling minister 
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born 
And where he did go he usually walked 
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home 

Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city 
Yes here was a man 
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness 
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world 

Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world 
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him 
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him 
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies 

Then he went through the mockery of a trial 
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves 
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled 
For the only piece of property that he had in this world 

And that was his robe his purple robe 
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross 
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends 
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone 

And today he's a centerpiece of the human race 
Our leader in the column to human destiny 
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched 
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas 

All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned

He tried to help everybody 'long

A cowboy met a fiery carnie queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carnie van
They laughed and loved and shared shortlived dreams

But the carnie show and the rodeo went their seperate ways
And the carnie season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark eyed carnie queen

From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire

I was still a child when my mama died
Of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name too wild to tame no one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone

In dingy bars and cold boxcars hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down

The black sheep child that grew up wild
From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire
An orphan of the road

In the misty rain I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep grey night I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor

And he said I tried to find her but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him but I never did but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die

I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flickerin' flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother sir I said of her I have her same dark eyes

""We've been everywhere once and some places twice""
As I had another helpin' of country ham
She said, ""We ain't never been to Vietnam
There's a bunch of our boys over there""
So, we went to the Orient, Saigon

Well, we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Ben
We checked in and everything got kinda quite
But a soldier boy said, ""Just wait 'til tonight
Things get noisy, things start happening'
Big bad firecrackers""

Well, that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
Then we crawled into bed for some peace and quite
But things weren't peaceful and things weren't quite
Things were scary

Well, for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say, ""What was that?""
I said ""That was a shell or a bomb""
She said, ""I'm scared"", I said, ""Me too""

Well, all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs and the motor shells
Shook our bed every time one fell and it never let up
It was gonna get worse before it got any better

Well when the sun came up the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep and we were sleepin' sound
Then a soldier knocked on our door and said
""Last night we brought in seven dead and fourteen wounded""
And would we come down to the base hospital
And see the boys, yeah

So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs 'til dawn again
And the helicopters brought in a wounded man
Night after night, day after day, comin' and a goin'

So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said so long
We did our best to let them know that we cared
For every last one of them it's over there
Whether we belonged over there or not
Somebody over here loves them and needs them

Well, now that's about all there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there anymore
Hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war's over with and they all come back home
To stay in peace

He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wanderin' eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time

Well Johnny he packed up to leave her but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
He said ""I'm your man I wouldn't do you wrong""

Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinkin' about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man he wasn't doin' her wrong

Then in the front door walked a redhead Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man but she was far away

He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none

Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him
She slapped him a time or two
She said ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you""
If you're her man you better treat her right

Well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

Then I thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.

Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed

But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things 
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then 
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him 
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks 
And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town 
A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us 
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk 
And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil 
A log apples cranges and such 
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found 
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down 
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door 
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said 
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door 
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back 
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light

Said, ""Where did all of the old songs go
Kids sure play funny music these days
They play it in the strangest ways""
Said, ""it looks to me like they've all gone wild
It was peaceful back when I was a child""
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries ""What is truth?""

A little boy of three sittin' on the floor
Looks up and says, ""Daddy, what is war?""
""son, that's when people fight and die""
The little boy of three says ""Daddy, why?""
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking 
""What is truth?""

A young man sittin' on the witness stand
The man with the book says ""Raise your hand""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries 
""What is truth?""

The young girl dancing to the latest beat 
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's wakin' to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way 
You better help the voice of youth find

Until she really needs me,

Yes I do,
But when that certain look comes on her face,
I can't replace it,
And she leaves me.

About as much as I need someone else,

Johnny Cash,"One time I was down to Jamaica to a place called Rose Hall Plantation
They grow a lot of sugarcane and tomatoes and things at Rose Hall now
It used to be just a sugarcane plantation back in the days of slavery
And they tell stories about the place and about the great house at Rose Hall
That many many years ago they came from the country of Haiti
A lady named Annie Palmer who lived in that great house there
And she was a mistress of the plantation she was the boss her word was law
Well they tell a lot of tales about Annie
They say she had three husbands one at a time I guess
But they also tell tales about Annie and the slaves
There were about 5000 slaves on the plantation
And she had her favorites and she had the ones that weren't her favorites
Well down on the sea there're three tall palm trees wavin' in the breeze
And they say that maybe Annie Palmer's three husbands
Are buried under those palm trees

On the Island of Jamaica quite a long long time ago
At Rose Hall Plantation where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer the mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear to see a frown on Annie's face

Where's your husband Annie where's number two and three
Are they sleeping neath the palms beside the Caribbean Sea
At night I hear you ridin' and I hear your lovers call
And still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall hmm

Well if you should ever go to see the great house at Rose Hall
There's expensive chairs and china and great paintings on the wall
They'll show you Annie's sitting room and the whipping post outside

For every man that puts in eight or ten hard hours a day 
Of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
Tryin' to get more out of him
Than he really ought to have to put in

After twenty nine long years of workin'
In this shop with Oney standin' over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire

And said they'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it

And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired

With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late.

But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire

He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not countin' on
Today's the day I give old Oney his

I've been workin', buildin' muscles
Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
And today about four thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost

Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?
Now you gonna die""

He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear

So I give ya that name and I said goodbye

A chart which will an able man then someday analyze
The wretched men who stumble then somehow cannot arise
They'll pay one man to draw the charts another to declare
What secret signs are in the lines but do they really care
That one is long and one is short and one line is not there
For charts or abstract documents that cannot have a soul
They cannot tell why this man fell and that one reached his goal
Nor can they tell why some rebel and lose all self control
I think a thousand years from now as it was long ago
Two roads will be for all to see but which way will man go
Will he arise toward the skies to reach for some new plateau
Will he devise a brave new world a world thus far unknown
Will he plow under all the seeds of greed and hate he sewn
Or will he steal the very field he plants his hopes upon
As long as there are two such roads a man can look upon
As long as some men linger deep within the twilight zone
The weak will always take the road that leads to wall of stone
There should be made a stone blockade torn from the prison stone
And make a wall across all roads man should not walk upon
And let the seeds of bitter weeds grow till that road is gone
Then those who sot in higher power those who hold the might
Could then direct the hordes of men on to the way that's right
And then the men who draw the charts would also see the light",The Invertebraes (Poem),1973

Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans.

Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina.

Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two.

God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.

She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky.
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills.
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up,
Maybe I should go to California

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.

The time for sweatin' poison out is just now comin' round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone

With the Junkie and the Juicehead who had problems of their own
Stuck with luck it kept me standin' just a step away from starvin'
And the talent that I swore I'd show before I'd go back home

Ninety days I looked the army makin' neither love nor money
And my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone
And the Junkie placed an order with the Prophet on the corner
And he told him of the soul that he'd been sellin' for a song

And I can see it's time for me to make my last request
Won't you fill my grave with whiskey when I'm laid away to rest
So the boys can say I drank myself to dead
Well I drank the whole thing over puttin' one and two together
And it added up to more of what I didn't want to be

And it comes down from the hills
And it goes down to the towns and passes through

I had caught many a fish out of that deep clear water

He said, ""Did you get a bite yet daddy?""
I said, ""I think I got a nibble son""
""Me too"", he said

This water's bad now and I might not be safe to eat the fish
But there was a time""

And you could see forever 'cross the plains
The wind was sweet as honey
And no one had ever heard of acid rain

And pourin' every kind of evil in the sea
We violated nature
And our children have to pay the penalty

Johnny Cash,"I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench an old man was sitting there
I said, your old courthouse is kinda run down
He said, naw, it'll do for our little town
I said, your old flagpole has leaned a little bit
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it

He said, have a seat, and I sat down
Is this the first time you've been to our little town?
I said, I think it is
He said, I don't like to brag
But we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag

You see, we got a little hole in that flag there when 
Washington took it across the Delaware
And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writing say can you see
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seams

And it almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the texas flag, but she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag

On Flanders field in World War one
She got a big hole from a Bertha gun
She turned blood red in World War Two
She hung limp and low a time or two
She was in Korea and Vietnam
She went where she was sent by Uncle Sam

She waved from our ships upon the Briny foam
And now they've about quit waving her back here at home
In her own good land here she's been abused 
She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused

And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout the land
And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
'Cause she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more

So we raise her up every morning
We take her down every night
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right

And often came into this town
But the thrills were too high for my little sky
So I dug in and I've settled down

And I got a good job in Nashville
No way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves
Making brut and snuff

Southern comfort is killin' me

I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room

Southern comfort is killin' me

I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carryin' on
She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on

But I guess she got tired of tobacco
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
And memories are burnin' in my mind

Will you show the bounds how all the chains can break
Did you sow the cropper seed will you walk among the weak

Johnny Cash,"Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine

I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town

We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
'Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook

Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
'Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy

And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind

Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got in on my mind

Johnny Cash,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play 
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom 
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.
 
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said 
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men. 

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor doubt he sleeps 
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men.

'Til ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day 
A voice, a chime, a chance so blind,
On earth goodwill to men.

Johnny Cash,"Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
He's been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway and an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind
He was all around cowboy 1959 from the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time

They rode him high and hard to the ground
But he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner
And the feeling of bein' a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again

The windmills're turning on the west Texas plains but he's dry as an old river bed
He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain but he knows he'll be ridin' again
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo to be the all around cowboy again
But he remembers the thrill",All Around Cowboy,1975

It rocks my childhood sleep

Johnny Cash,"This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfillin' his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County

Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true

So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God

Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil

And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got

Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased

And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel

I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Ain't nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's gettin' weaker and she's gettin' older every day

And she talks softly about joinin' papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Tryin' to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean

But I just wish that papa was here right now

Man, look at that beans and look at that corn

Johnny Cash,"Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writin' on
And after wipin' her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said

For mowing the yard 5 dollars
For making my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For getting a good report card 5 dollars
And for raking the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents

Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turning the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him

For the nine months she carried you growing inside her, no charge
For the nights we sat up with you, doctoring you, praying for you, no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead, no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college, no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

Well when I finished readin' he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you

And the ole men left their domioes and come down from the bars

And everybody's checkin' old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop
So we already knowed it when they finally said train time

'Cause things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
But not vbefore I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track

Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks

He said, ""I'll pay you a quarter at a time startin' tomorrow

Then the section foreman said, ""Hey! Hammer-swinger!
I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?"" and he said,
""I can turn a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.""
""Can you swing a hammer, boy?"" ""Yes sir, I'll do anything you hire me to.""

When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees

And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with

So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down

And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man

Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the loggin' camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please

I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees

Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud

When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's gonna fall for the Timber man

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

And when they're cuttin' on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall

There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray

And send a picture of mother if you can

But stay with me just another minute or so or so

I thought my guitar was out of tune at first

It is out of tune
Is that right?
Terry, is that right?
Will you tune this son bitch for me?
Got all kinds of songs, here's one called ""A boy named sue""
You want to hear that one?
You want to hear ""a boy named sue""?
I do too. I'm anxious to hear it
I don't know how in the hell it's gonna sound. I'm anxious to hear it
Does that camera block your view right there, is that alright?
You want me to leave it there?
Just gonna put it there then
Where in the hell is my guitar? Oh, here it is

We're sorry to say, the Luther passed away seven months ago
After being with us for 13 years. Luther Perkins
And uh, the fella that is playing the guitar with us now is doing a wonderful job
'Course nobody can really replace Luther.
How about one big cheer for Luther Perkins

Yeah, I had a song called San Quentin, I was going to do
Where's my....hey, in my kit back in there where I've got all my dope
I mean, where I got all my things

There's a, there's a, there's a little red notebook back there
Would somebody, would one of the guards bring it to me
Somebody bring it to me, bring me the red notebook, and I will uh..

Hey, that, that briefcase back there of mine, you know,
That's got all the songs I stole in it

Telling it like it is, ain't I? Alright

Wrote a song yesterday. I try.
It takes a lot of imagination to write a sometimes to write a song
And to really, to really put something into it
Where somebody else can understand it and feel it .
Well we've been in several prisons
San Quentin, and Folsom prison, and the Starkville Mississippi jail
An El Paso jail. And uh.
You wouldn't believe it, one night I got in jail in Starkville Mississippi
For picking flowers.
I was walking down the street. I may sing heaven for you a little bit later
I was walking down the street....what?
Excuse me I couldn't hear you I was talking
I was walking down the street, and uh
You know, going to get me some cigarettes or something
'Bout two in the morning, after a show. I think it was
Anyway, I reached down and picked a dandelion here and a daisy there as I went along
And this car pulls up.
Said, get it the hell in here boy, what are you doing?
Said, I'm just picking flowers
Well,thirty six dollars for picking flowers and a night in jail (goddamn)
You can't hardly win can ya, goddamn
No telling what they'd do if you pull an apple or something
Well I'd like to do this song on behalf of all you guys in San Quentin
To kinda get back at whoever you want to out there
In my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville Mississippi
That still has my thirty six dollars

Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel,
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well.
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees;

I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze.
I found myself surrounded; one policeman said: ""That's him.
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m.""

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
I said: ""What the hell did I do?""
And he said: ""Shut up and sit down.""

Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Ah, shut up.""
Well, I sure was in a fix.

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so;
I ain't bein' treated right.""

Well, they're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.

Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
At 8 a.m. they let me out, I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!""
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.",Starkville City Jail,1976

In New York city just walking the street
Ran out of money had nothing to eat
I stopped at the Plaza, that fancy hotel
Where you can check in if you're well to do wellâ?¦
The first of July and a hundred and four
I stopped at the Plaza's front revolving door
I stepped in the door and went around for a ride
Treatin' myself to the cool air inside
Then I found myself in a chandeliered room
Where people were dining and I hid in the gloom
My hunger pains hurt 'til I thought I would break
When a waiter brought out a big strawberry cake

Oh that strawberry cake
Oh that strawberry cake
Out in California them berries were grown
And into this city them berries were flown
For making that strawberry cake

Then I thought of Oxnard, just north of LA
Where I picked strawberries for many a day
Hard work with no future for the harvest was done
And I headed eastward a-travelin' by thumb
And nobody wanted me here in this town
I felt like a stray dog they all kick around
Them berries reminded me of my bad breaks
I'm hungry and I want that strawberry cake

I deserve that strawberry cake
Deserve that strawberry cake
I ran and I grabbed it then out the side door
Into Central Park through the bushes I tore
Holdin' my strawberry cake

I look back behind me and what do I see
The chef and headwaiter and the maÃ®tre d
I had a nice helpin' of cake as I ran
I gobble them berries as fast as I can
They're closin' the gap as I slowed down to eat
But the cake brought a new surge of power to my feet
I hid in the bush when the lead I did take
And I quietly finished my strawberry cake

I ate all that strawberry cake
That fine fancy strawberry cake
Someone at the plaza is without dessert
But for the first time in days now my belly don't hurt
I'm full of strawberry cake



",Strawberry Cake,1976
Johnny Cash,"In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation

I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growin'
And the seasons changed and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowin'

Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breathtakin' lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people

And I rambled north and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted

In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothin' green ever growin'
Where the buildings hide the risin' sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowin'

Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after

In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said, ""Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people?""

And she said, ""I will"", and she said, ""I do""
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
'Cause she loved the noisy city

But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growin'
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to goin'

Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said, ""I'll take the city""

Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm goin' home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older

I'll be waiting for you after the ball

After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand, I've got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall
I'll be waiting for you after the ball

Johnny Cash,"I woke up this afternoon and looked into your eyes
And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go

I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
'Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go

County road 6-40, State Highway 45
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go

Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain
Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all
You'll never know, you'll never know
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go

Johnny Cash,"Lady your arms're always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
Lady in the middle of the night
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone

Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you

They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closin' time

I don't like beer

Wow man I believe the little lady here wants champagne

Hey yeah could I have champagne

Do you think we're a couple of bankers here or somethin'

I like that

That ain't beer honey that's Coors

Well the barman's right
Beer the bar girls too much beer I must be seein' things
I saw you sittin' on a barstool lady and I looked up and you were gone
You didn't like beer either did you lady liked champagne neither did you lady
In Denver Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
Hey maybe she's out there somewhere hey lady hahaha
Hey I ran maybe she ran maybe I did see her downstairs
Maybe she's drownin' her blues like I did
Hey maybe I did see her down there havin' a ball somewhere comin' up to me

Johnny Cash,"There once was a musical troupe
A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land

They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy on his rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted",The One on the Right Is on the Left,1978
Johnny Cash,"About 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with The Gambler; We were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
Til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak. 

He said: ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
""And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
""And if you don't mind my sayin', I would say you're out of aces;
""And for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice."" 

So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
He said: ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right."" 

""'Cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
""Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
""And ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
""And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. 

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done."" 

And when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
Put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

I guess ours had one
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
Well his name was Abner Brown

I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
And nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin

He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town
So they tolerated Abner Brown

And all us kids were on his side
'Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall
'Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all

And after school and on weekends
You could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was
A good old drunk named Abner Brown

Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low
And higher places that I've been

Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown

Lord take me back to the cotton land
To Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin

He's probably dead many years ago
And gone the way that old drunks go

I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man

Johnny Cash,"I'm gonna sit on the porch and pick on my old guitar
I'm gonna lay on my back and laugh at my lucky star
And then I'm gonna fly away and never come back someday
'Less I thought I was gonna land right close to where you are

Well, if I thought anybody cared I'd send back word
Strapped to the leg of a trans celestial bird
I wonder if I really ever did leave how many would there be to grieve?
How would they react to the word?

Well, I wouldn't ever want to hurt a solitary soul
I have still got all 6 foot 2 in control
But when my obligation's low is a greasy uphill road
And pleasin' everybody but me is my first goal

I want to sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
And just hope you're hangin' loose where ever you are
And for the joy you brought to me this song I sung for thee
While I sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar

But I should have reigned more with her
Too often I left my queen alone

And that was no way to treat her
I kept her hangin' like grapes on the vine
And that was no way to keep her

And casually mentioned my misdeeds
He promised her love far greater than mine
Thus pulled out and plucked my grapes from the vine

I built her a castle with patios
But I seldom cooked out upon it
I bought her a TV with stereo
But I never listened much to it

I have the vine but the grapes are gone
And that's no way to run a vineyard

Running o'er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Sou'ville headquarters on the line
Receiving there strict orders from a station just behind

Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time

Up the road he darted against the rocks he crashed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast was smashed
His head lay against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad to be born for an engineer on the C&O road to die

The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy lie still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die with the engine I love one hundred and forty three

The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved

And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee",Engine 143,1979
Johnny Cash,"The assembly line is runnin' slow on Monday
They've been livin' it up
And layin' up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to kinda come around
But they still feel bad and they're down

And mad ‘cause they've got four more day
Before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feelin' fine again
And they're workin' like a dog and diggin' in

Tryin' to do everything they should
Puttin' 'em cars together good
And I got me a car that was made
On Wednesday, on Wednesday

If you're gonna buy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough
To get one made on Wednesday

On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week
That's the day they make lemons dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday
Friend, you'll soon be in the creek

’Cause it's payday and the loafin' has begun
Lord them Friday cars just hope you don't get one

Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday

Johnny Cash,"This world that I live in is empty and cold
This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul
I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son
I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run

So here I return to a back street of thrills
Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill
And then I treat shame like an old friend from home
That I can lean on till the misery is gone

A new day is here yet nothing is new
You're still gone and I tremble for you

I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight
But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light
Of course you're not there, no, you never are
Then I try to forget that there's always a bar

And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do
But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you

",I Tremble for You,1979
Johnny Cash,"Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams

",My Old Faded Rose,1979
Johnny Cash,"I stood in there in the shadows
As they went strolling by
Now she ain't my girl no longer
There's no reason I should cry

But I knew there went my future
And I couldn't stop the tears
And the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I spent every dime I had on her
And when it was gone
She said, ""Hun, it's sure been fun
But it's time you moved along""

So I stood there in the shadows
And I had my .44
I could hear her mocking laughter
But she won't laugh anymore

Now I'm down here in the gaol house
And I know what brought me here
It was the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

Well, I guess, I should have left this town
And her far behind
For the way that she made fun of me
Keeps running through my mind

Well, the jury showed no mercy
And I never asked for none
'Cause I know I've got it coming
I'm not proud of what I've done

But down here in this darkness
More and more I seem to hear
The sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I hear the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ear

Some old times, some old friends
When suddenly it crossed my mind
That I would like to see you a-gain

Come on back, make you blue

And some old shack, and me and you

And a whole lot has happened since then

And I would like to see you again

Remember how we used to walk and talk
Walk and talk, holdin' hands
We said we loved each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans

Straighten it out, and go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times

Rolls along past houses, farms & fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor

Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scalded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Fan

Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact

Johnny Cash,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black",Man in Black,1981
Johnny Cash,"Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a fifty three
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

Ugh! Yeah, RED RYDER
This is the COTTON MOUTH
In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on

Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh!, what model is it?

And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy

Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

It's a story that's never been told

Leaving my poor ol' darling alone)
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
Now I have a grand ship out on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
That ship would be anchored and sold

Over these prison walls I would fly

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1984
Johnny Cash,"WAYLON:
It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago
She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio, playin' low
The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
JOHNNY:
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh, so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
But just running against the wind
WILLIE:
And the years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worrying about paying or how much I owed
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
I found myself seekin'
Shelter against the wind
WILLIE:
All those drifter's days are passed me now
I've got so much more to think about
JOHNNY:
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
Well I'm older now and still
Running against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind

Johnny Cash,"Well now, boys I've been to Bethlehem,
Rode there on a big steam train.
Lost two fenders in the steel wheels,
And I ain't goin' back again. 

I fought for my country,
Lord knows I did my best.
Crawlin' cross some foreign field,
They pinned a ribbon to my chest. 

So pass around the bottle boys,
Let's talk about old times.
Night's rollin' in, it's cold as sin,
Here on the welfare line. 

Served on a Georgia road gang,
Couldn't pay the debts I owed.
'Cos I ain't made of silver,
And I ain't ever seen no gold.

I still remember Rachel,
Soft as a velvet gown.
They laid her in a pauper's grave,
On the other side of town. 

So pass around the bottle boys,
Let's talk about old times.
Night's rollin' in, it's cold as sin,
Here on the welfare line. 

Now some folks are born to money,
You know I wish 'em well.
If the devil should ever want my soul,
I swear I'd never sell. 

So pass around the bottle boys,
Let's talk about old times.
Night's rollin' in, it's cold as sin,
Here on the welfare line. ",Welfare Line,1985
Johnny Cash,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""

I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind
With a sharp axe to grind

I don't understand why there is loneliness

And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laughed and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
Roam from town to town to hide my shame

I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now you gonna die!""
Yeah that's what I told 'em

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah he said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue""
Yeah what could I do, what could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
Called him my Pa, and he called me his son
