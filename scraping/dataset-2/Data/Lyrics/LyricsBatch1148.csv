The Hooters,"My wicked ways have drank the wine of the world and its delights 
But I've never tasted anything as sweet as you tonight 
I've driven down these boulevards and I've found Love's Avenue 
But of all I've seen well I learned one thing...

I don't want nobody but you...Your elegant interior had me fooled 
I must admit But when it comes to comfort there's no finer place to sit 
You've driven me to doing things no honest man would do 
But I've never seen such a fine machine...I don't want nobody but you...

Well I'm lying in your flower bed I'm drunk on your perfume 
Just waiting for the seeds I planted once to come in bloom 
You ravage me you savage me and you know I love it too 
So away we fly just you and I...I don't want nobody but you...I don't want nobody but you...",Nobody But You,1997
The Hooters,"Was it one too many words I could not say 
Was it one too many times I drove away 
Well, this heart of mine is way beyond repair 
And it's one too many nights without you there 

Now it's one too many shots I gotta drink 
And it's one too many times I gotta think 
It's easy to pretend that I don't care 
But it's one too many nights without you there... 

And if it's over said and done 
Why do I go on believing 
And if too much time has passed 
Let me find my peace at last... 

And the sun sill always rise and set again 
And the wind will blow no matter where or when 
Well it blows me down a road that goes nowhere 
And it's one too many nights without you there... 
It's one too many nights without you there...",One Too Many Nights,1997
The Hooters,"What happened to the heart that I gave you 
What are you hiding in your chest these days 
You wanted somebody to save you 
I wanted someone who could not be saved 

Living in the shadow of Jesus 
It's so hard to bear your cross every day 
Was it easy for you, Christ, 
It's murdering me 
Now I'm down on my knees with a reason to pray 

You tell me experience has changed you 
From where I'm looking that's not hard to see 
You wanted out and how could I blame you 
When I'm not looking are you blaming me 

Living in the shadow of Jesus 
It's so hard to bear your cross every day 
Was it easy for you, Christ, 
It's murdering me 
Now I'm down on my knees with a reason to pray 

We've shifted into meaningless chatter 
This kind of talking could go on for days 
We've been through the heart of the matter 
Don't make no difference at the end of the day 

Living in the shadow of Jesus 
It's so hard to bear your cross every day 
Was it easy for you, Christ, 
It's murdering me 
Now I'm down on my knees with a reason to pray",Shadow of Jesus,1997
The Hooters,"Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
Summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by hour house
Though I know you're not home

[Chorus]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back now
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

[Chorus]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see ya walkin' real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a dead head sticker on a cadilac
A little voice inside my head said, don't look back, you should never look back
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let 'em go but,

[Chorus]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone

[Chorus]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and it's
Wavy and long baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone",The Boys of Summer,2007
The Hooters,"I've got a condition for which there is no cure
I'm in a position that everyone prays for
Got a sound in my head that could wake up the dead
Like the who singing Summertime blues
Got no thorn in my side, got no secrets to hide
I'm completely and utterly amused

[Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive
It's a beautiful day and I'm happy to say
I'm alive, I'm alive
And wherever I go it's amazing to know
I'm alive

From running fast as fast as I could getting nowhere
I'm standing incredibly steadily somewhere
Got a hand on a jug and a girl that I love
And it's driving me out of my mind
I'm a bird on the wing with the world on a string
And I'm feeling incredibly fine

[Chorus]

I'm looking older now than when I was a kid
But feeling younger now than I ever did
And I've got no situations playing tricks upon my mind
I'm feeling Christmas in the middle of Juli

In the morning, in the night
Though I walk though the valley of the shadows
You are the light of my life
And the song in my soul
And the beat of my heart
And the rock in my roll

[Chorus]

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive",I'm Alive,2007
The Hooters,"If I had a way to make time stand still
I'd had a lot more time to kill
Sit on the beach and drink my fill
If I had a way to make time stand still

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here
Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a way to make time stand still

If I had a little more time with you
I'd be the man you'd want me to
Do all the things that I should to
If I had a little more time with you

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here

Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a little more time with you

If I had a way to make time turn back
I'd find a way to get you back
One of these days I know I will
When I find a way to make time stand still

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here
Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a way to make time stand still
If I had a way to make time stand still

Just a little time, just a little
Just a little time, just a little",Time Stand Still,2007
The Hooters,"Who will call my name
Who will I call friend
Life won't be the same
Until I find you again

Time has had it's way
My faith is at it's end
I won't rest a day
Until I find you again

Somewhere on the mountain
Somewhere in a valley

Somewhere on a sidewalk
Somewhere in an alley
Somewhere I'll be watching
Somewhere I'll be waiting
Though the road is winding
Someday I'll be finding you
Finding you [x4]

I'll be far away
My search will never end
But in my heart you'll stay
Until I find you again 

Until I find you again
Until I find you again
Oh again

Until I find, until I find
Until I find you again",Until I Find You Again,2007
The Hope Blister,"The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone 
And me I am her dagger 
To numb to feel her pain 
The world is full of noise yeah 
I hear it all the time 
And me I am your dagger 
You know I am your world (you know I am your wound) 
I thought I heard you whisper 
It happens all the time 
I thought I heard you whisper 
It happens all the time 
She whispers while I'm sleeping 
I love you when you smile 
I didn't really lose you 
I just lost it for a while 
The world is full of noise yeah 
I hear it all the time 
You know I am your dagger

The Hope Blister,"I'm waiting on the empty docks 
Watching the ships come in 
I'm waiting for the agony to stop 
Oh, let the happiness in 
I'm watching as the gulls all settle down 
Upon the empty vessels 
The faded whites of their wedding gowns 
The songs of hopeless selflessness 
The cold December Sun 
A cold that blisters 
The hands of a working man wasted 
I'm waiting on the empty docks 
Watching the ships roll in 
I'm longing for the agony to stop 
Oh, let the happiness in, 
Oh, let the happiness in 
Listen to the waves against the rocks 
I don't know where they've been 
I'm waiting for the skies to open up 
And let the happiness in, 
Oh, let the happiness in
",Let the Happiness In,1998
The Hope Blister,"Spider and I sit watching the sky 
On our world without sound.
We knit a web to catch one tiny fly 
For our world without sound. 
We sleep in the mornings,
We dream of a ship that sails away, 
A thousand miles away
We sleep in the mornings,
We dream of a ship that sails away, 
A thousand miles away",Spider and I,1998
The Hope Conspiracy,"I have nothing left inside
Today I let it wither and die
With a cutting crash of broken past
And a reckless pace for killing it fast
Falling down
I have sufferd too long
Beaten till my heart was cold
Within the frames I watch the decay
Of everything I love falling away
Falling down again.
",Fallen,2002
The Hope Conspiracy,"This ritual is a crushing of the spirit sleepless and suffering I have 
Broken it's been dark the light of day is months away and I am years 
From what I used to be I've tried so hard to find a piece of myself for 
The love of the pain I push on through it all wake up. do it again DAY 
IN AND DAY OUT connecting fully to the stings of sorrow so let the 
Judgement pass because there's no tomorrow DAY IN AND DAY OUT I did it 
For love but only hurt you instead just blame and betray with nothing 
Left to give Days In. Days Out I did it for love no more.",For Love,2002
The Hoppers,"It is settled I am certain 
In my heart and in my mind 
I pass the glory curtain and
I leave this world behind
I will stand with the immortal 
With the happy land in view 
And I'll journey through the portal
Down the golden avenue

I'm gonna leave some glorious morning yes I am yes I am 
I'm gonna cross that chilly Jordan yes I am yes I am
Though the water is deep and the river is wide 
I'm gonna stand on the other side
I'm gonna leave for the heaven someday yes I am yes I am

I am waiting at the station
Listening closely for the call
I have made my reservation 
With the one who paid it all
Not by might not by power 
But in Christ and Christ alone
I am leaving any hour 
Praise the lord I'm going home

I'm gonna leave some glorious morning yes I am yes I am 
I'm gonna cross that chilly Jordan yes I am yes I am

I'm gonna stand on the other side
I'm gonna leave for the heaven someday yes I am yes I am

The Hoppers,"John saw a city that could not be hidden
John saw the city, oh yes he did
John caught a glimpse of the golden throne
Tell me all about it, go right on
Around the throne he saw the crystal sea
There's got to be more, what will it be
I want to go, to that city he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run where the angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that city, the city of God

John saw the lion lay down by the lamb
I want to know everything about that land
John saw the day but he did not see night
The lamb of God well, he must be the light
And he saw the saints worship the great I am
Crying worthy, worthy is the lamb
I want to go to that city he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run where the angels have trod

Sing for the night is over
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna forever
Forever more

[Chorus: Repeat x3]
I like the way you do it, when you do it
When you doin, what you doin

Check this out right here, son
We about to move to make you feel some
A lot of positive vibrations to build from
Cause all I wanna do is lose some and win some
Have a little of prosperity and then some
Livin my life handsome, has always been a dream but
Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it)
I keep my shit, plus thirty in between
When an arm reach out to grab the supreme
Cause I won't stop, and AP won't stop
And Tab won't stop until we reach the top
That means we won't quit, so we stay thick so you can enjoy it
I know you like the way it's goin down, honey, honey
I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey
Doin this ain't all about money, money
I know you like the way I sound, right, right

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

As I enter the room I absorb the mood
Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew
And negativity exist and you must acknowledge
You can be intelligent and never go to college
Cause the way we live in society
It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC
Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track
Once you R-E-D then you never go back
'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black
With Adam, Taboo, and alligator APL De AP

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

I wanna travel the world and stop on every city
Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec
Close your eyes and don't fret
Listen to the audible sounds and just let
Your soul feel the free feelin
Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the top
I'd rather be ready for the future
Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya
I juxtapose for mine to maintain
And segregate myself from evil and pain

The Horrible Crowes,"I'm in love with the night
Every breath of this house creaking
I'm familiar with the cold and the windows and the doors
And the sound of my heart beating
Beating in and out of time

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane

I walk around these empty rooms
We once moved like the morning
Silhouettes they haunt this house
Like a memory haunts me now
As if it were a dream
As if it were a dream

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane

I heard the moon has visions of her nightly
I heard the mighty rivers cry out her
I saw the heaven and the earth
I saw the heavens and the earth cry alone to you

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane",Behold the Hurricane,2011
The Horrible Crowes,"My love, my love, you're the sting of the scorpion.
Consider, now, the angels, a little lower than you.
And they twist and they turn, and they hold their breath 'til it's blue.
And they can't turn away like I can, when you're lookin' like you do.

Look at Black Betty, what they're tyin' to you.
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do.
Now you got yourself caught in this silk spiderweb.
I hope the money fills the holes, can see the roof is caving in.

My heart, my heart, you're the moon and her shining light.
Darkness and voider form, like you were keeping me alive.
And I've been dreaming of poisonings from the venom of my enemies.
Clever as the viper, dear, but gentle as a stampede of stones.

Look at Black Betty, what they're tyin' to you.

The Horrible Crowes,"My first love was an arsonist
Black eyes, deep set and avarice
Red lips built like a tomb
You'll never get out of this (some day I'll see to this)
And moonlight I found would bow
To her slender hand stretched out
Fingers inside your heart and your mind
You'll never get out of this (some day I'll see to this)
Boy

And I'll tell you when it's over
I'll tell you when you can leave
I'll tell you when you cried long enough
Til your blood fills my cup
And my footsteps, they hung in your hallways enough
For you to be truly haunted (baby, by me)

My first love was a murderer
Before I ever got to her
Tongue so sharp and serpentine
Waltz to remember her (I'll call you later)
And I heard a curse being born
Forming each finger and forming each thorn
Til I became like a stone
Things never got better (but I'll call you later)
And practicing lies to drip like red wine off her lips

And I'll tell you when it's over
I'll tell you when you can leave
I'll tell you when you cried long enough
Til your blood fills my cup
My footsteps, they hung in your hallways enough
For you to be truly haunted

The Horrible Crowes,"I drive this car through the city every night
There's a quiet I never heard before
And lonely, my sister could not describe
All the good things gone wrong

And there was blood on my teeth
From the long winter here
Bones broke in half
A stain on my shirt
From a couple hours out with the boys
And all good things come to an end
And all memory has left my bones

If I drove straight off this bridge
Only God and my baby would know
I'm sure she'd be laughing, conjuring spring
With some fella who just said the right thing

And there'd be blood on my teeth
From the long winter here
Bones broke in half
A stain on my shirt
From a couple hours out with the boys
And all good things come to an end

See all I can do is think about you
And miss all your kisses like the spring
But if I had a sign
That one day you'd be mine again, oh no
If I could hold you right then
As the chill in this season sputtered and spit and died with

Blood on my teeth
From just what they did here
Snow tumbling down on the ground
And me stumbling out of my heart
Finding cherry blossoms on the hood of my car",Cherry Blossoms,2011

I'll sing you a song
Don't worry about the money, honey
I got a tab a mile long
Bathe me up in light

I've spent my whole life
Less up than my downs

I know a secret everybody tell
Who goes to heaven, who goes to hell
And I know one thing sure is true
I never kept a secret
I got a crush on you

You're everybody's dream
Out on the schoolboy yard
They tumble like an injury
Just about you all night long
All night long
And there was a fire
In your breast and in my brain
Your fingers on my fingertips
Making lines in the windowpane

I know a secret everybody tell

The Horrible Crowes,"I've been known to wear a fine black suit and a murder of a tie
I've got miles on my shoes that your brothers can't buy

And they say
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And they say
Sugar, baby, we've got something to see
And they say
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And even what you want

So go tell everybody that you drove your poor lover crazy
And take a good look at just what the night did
There ain't nothing left of your dearly departed
And I just fell to pieces on the night that you said you were leaving
You can't come back to the heart that you left
So go tell everybody that your man is dead

And there's always just these three siren spirits always following me
They just appeared one night in the passenger seat
They tell me all about your sins, salivate from their tongues
And they kiss from their lips but their fingers is so cold to the touch

Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
Sugar, baby, we've got something to see
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And even what you want

So go tell everybody that you drove your poor lover crazy

The Horrible Crowes,"I met you in the upper room
Of a house where I slept with the angels
From hell and from heaven

And I kept my secrets far from your condition
And in the explosions they both were just powders
In faded jean jackets to look just like our daddies

All my lovers were liars too
Did you say you were afraid of dying?
I ain't lived a single day without you

Did you say you were lonely?
I was just about to call you

The Horrible Crowes,"I guess the moon it had it out for us
And the night and the stars the same
Everything she touched turned to stone or died eventually
Or was never seen the same again

Yeah, and this heart I had
You never sympathize
And while you held my hand
I think I witnessed a crime

While she drove we sat in silence
All I could do was try to breathe
Her and I we never talked too much or licked our wounds
Just lived between the hours of sleep

And in this dream I had
My screams were baby's breath
I watched her steal the air
Right from the atmosphere

Oh this heart I had
You never paid no mind
And on the long drive home
I think I witnessed a crime

And she said I just went crazy from the heat
And I just lit a little fire under your feet
And that's not so bad see people do it all the time

Morgan moves back to the familiar charms of his fiery days when Morgan still felt something. 
No longer
Morgan's like a slave, three feet of paper and a family of four. 
Morgan wonders why his wife is so slow, blames his wife for his slow love. 
He shakes his head as he climbs into bed, 
Grits his teeth as he moves between the sheets. 
Morgan feels like sudden laughter when he sees. 

Excellent!

He doesn't sleep much on account of a terrible pain in his head. 
And sometimes Morgan sits up in the loft reading from a book of children's stories.

In my opinion 
You've made an excellent choice. 
I don't want to put the doubt in your mind. 
In my head, well, you're just fine
Excellent choice.

Jaws no ordinary sucking harder, sagging eyelids & pocked cheeks, 
Intelligent the television buzzes & crackles & preaches 
Morgan feels like his family have made a conscious effort to cause him misery. 
His taste buds have deserted, sneaking away from his wife's cooking. 
Morgan dreads the family meal, clenching one hand under the table.
The bland wall hangings nod at the food in recognition. They are far too familiar with one another.
Morgan's work for minimum wage is no comfort. 
He thinks about the items that have sapped his money over the years, shoe polish, oven cleaner, vacuum bags, sugar substitute. 
A pathetic collection of unwanted gifts and dream-sapping commerce.
Any creative reserves once stored are long gone.
Morgan seethes at the realisation he has given his children too much of the little he has. 
Morgan wishes his family dead. 

Well I'm not trying to alter your opinion
I'm so happy that you've finally found your voice.
I don't want to put the doubt in your mind

Maybe it's not,

And though it's hard, for me to say,
I know you're better off this way.

And when I told her I didn't love her anymore,
She cried.
And when I told her, her kisses were not like before,
She cried.
And when I told her another girl had caught my eye,
She cried.
And I kissed her, with a kiss that could only mean goodbye.

Before they pull you in

A joining of decision and dismay
And clay was forming over her feet

Before they push you under
Away, away, you let it go
Before it pulls you in

It comes so close to me today

In a cold dirty room that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf

Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
>From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin' in the street

I'm gonna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street

He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels

Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands

And a good saloon in every single town

Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
 
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea     
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

And I'll be damned if it did not come true

Give us a ballot of names, and expect us to vote

Show me a politician and I'll show you a crook
Show me a police officer that go by the book
They'll plant dope on ya, go to court on ya
Give ya 99 years and slam the door on ya

I see straight through cut-throat niggas easily
They tryin' to snatch me, 'cause they know I'm what ya used to be
'cause I'm a major fu-uh-factor to see-M-be
But I keep a chopper that's damn near as big as me

Hope you got your boys and you straped tight
'cause this bout to be some shit you won't like
Picture this, a fome hot, to your dome hot
I was a bitch before I drew down, now I got a new sound
You found a nigga that you though was a hoe
He's probably from your family, you married the most
Who's the be, what's the beef, my lady she's pregnant
She's already 5 months, so we lookin at oh 3
My baby bout to touch down, man I can't do this with a frown
Bustin that niggas dick over my pops corner
All my people are probably wondering what's going on
Playin a chess game, gotta keep my eye on this mate
All the way from Adam and Eve, not fuckin Steve

Unless you want to get fuck over

That's niggas is doctor p, knock the niggas door down
He hit his head on bed, 24/7
I gotta deal with these niggas and bitches till 2:11
What are them niggas that are duckin the law
Who them niggas who just shot up your car
What you call them niggas that are ready for war
What you call them niggas that go too far
Hot Boys running with kerosene running through everything
All the way to shit, you never seen
To Magnolia and back
Niggas talk bout me but then they never seen
Seeing them niggas in the cages, duckin stages, thinkin they courageous
I'mma bust you in the head, my enemies trying to fled
See-Murder trying to come up here and murder
Some motherfuckin claim to representin
He ain't from the magnolia, so this shit ain't reminiscin
This is my system
Like an addiction that's like fiction
My victums can't see 'cause they bitchin
Don't worry, I'll make them believers
When my blood pressure get high and over steamers
This week will not be cut

You niggas trying to check wit us
We'll make it so you respectin us

This nigga be seeing the bright light
And when he gets in park, end his life

When I got that iron in my hand I'm goin' to slang it
When I got that drama on my mind I'm goin' to bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business look here he hatin'

Coming uptown playboy we gonna slang it
If I catch down nigga bad we gonna leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin' uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get takin'
Paper is burn
They come fast, ya can't shake it
Picture this my brother Cash Money done went nation
That come's from seven hard years of dedication

Fuckin' with B.G. nigga
I'm puttin' on your face and I'm a kill me a nigga
That's believin' worth six figures we call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga, nigga

Police can investigate but they ain't gonna find shit
But a hundred bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see them workin' on somethin' look here we riders
Ain't like workin' niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We get cha if we gotta
Wig split cha if we gotta
I know you ain't got word that B.G.'s a rider
So keep it on the D.L

Cause they play for keeps
A one way ticket to hizell
Six feet deep
It's a filthy dirty rizell
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind
By the time I was nine
Look here nigga I was slangin' that nine

Now them them don't want us
They know me and Turk don't fuss in the corners
They already know that we brothers, Blood
Or whatever you wanna call it
Click up wit my dog we get crazy like alcoholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the Lex or Benz
Its gonna be on twenny, twen, twens

Get off the block when we come nigga (nigga)
To the lane
Shots that close shop when the bullets start spraying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin'
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin'

The nigga wanna try and die Lord

Niggas wanna learn hard way

Make 'em suffer

I guess you probably standin' there sayin, ""Who's the muthafucka?""
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, that'll bruise a muthafucka
Either there's been a lot of cross-firin' in the bricks
And I'm gonna kill me a nigga
If they put me in that shit
Look I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want but Cash Money goin' broke
Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'
Cause ain't no peace treaties whodie
You better not leave that forty-five at your house cause you gonna need it whodie
I told you boy, I'm a soljah boy

Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah ya'll a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self, from Brooklyn, where else
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I'll rip your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think I'm stupid
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep

I throw a bomb through you window
Burn you up and your hoe
I catch your mama going to therapy
And cut her throat
You lil' sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit ya park close up with the Louisville Slugger
BGeezy is the hustla, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head busters
Cluckers, you know I got 'em, two for one, my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on

Thuggin is my thing, if I'm beefing I'm banging
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like 'em, bitches, I don't trust'em
Niggas, I can't stand 'em, I creep down and pluck'em
Strap tsay in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, pop goes the nine
That's how it gotta be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play this game for keep

I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'ma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years, since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit 'cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, 'cause that's what I love

I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Don't have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't 'bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

Na, na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip 'em and reverse 'em
I'm coming so alert them
'Fore I hurt them, desert eagle bursting
You haven't seen the worst and

Verse Two: Lil' Turk 



A lil nigga seventeen playin with six figures 

Got so much ice you can skate on a nigga

I ain't seen a click yet that can stunt like mine 

I ain't seen a marette that can run like mine 

1999, and it's our turn to shine 

Fifty or better on our wrist and they all blind 

Pourin vodka til I die drank til I faint 

Til a nigga tell me I need another drank 

My nigga Baby told me work nigga trick to them hoes 

Nigga Baby told me work nigga better than treatin yo nose 

I'm the freak of the click 

Keep it on the tuck so I creep on a bitch 

And I play it on the raw never sleep with a bitch

Never weep for a bitch

Head buster set ripper 
Neighborhood superstar 
Going to split up 
While we dispose of 
Nigga broad hitter 
Hot Boys soldier 
Expedition flipper hell 
Niggaz be terrified of us cause they know how we play 
Them niggaz hide form us or catch 3 from a K (AK) 
I'm just a scrub I can't scuff 
I'm too light to fight 
I'm too thin to win so I ride at night 
Your face respect nigga 
You're playing with the wrong one 
I'll break your neck nigga 
You're playing with the wrong gun 
I use K's to wet niggaz I'm spraying the whole room 
Better watch your back nigga

Watch niggaz step up when I bust a cap 
Niggaz drop like (whistle) splat 
keep joking here and gone show you what I'm bout 
Respect my mind or get your brains knocked out 

Chorus: 
Respect my mind or get your brains knocked out

(Juvenile) 
Watch me grow up 
When I was small he had plan 
My daddy was balling and he was the right hand man 
My poppa bought us a house to keep our family secure 
Livin good on a ranch in the middle of the woods 
I understood at a young age my daddy would spray 
Seen him slit a niggaz throat and shoot one up in the face 
He'd be murder case after case he was untouchable 
But he had a right hand man that wasn't trustable 
Who undercover slow made deals under the table 
Working for the feds round my people wearing a cable 
My daddy got busted so we got left at the door 
All of our shit got repossessed 
And our family was flat broke 
Moved back inside the projects in summer 84 
(?) from Yomey and Black Zo 
And I got to the point where I wouldn't smile no more 
Hooked up the same nigga that handled my daddy dough 
I know that he sheisty but the nigga just don't know 
Swear to god I ain't bout it but the nigga just don't know 
I got 2 under my belt and gone make it one more 
cock the 4-4 and knock his brain out on the floor 
respect my mind

That's how the game going that's how the game get played 
Head buster for sure sweat no hoes haters get sprayed 
All week long look I'm a nigga on the grind 
All year long I make you niggaz respect my mind 
Every single day it's a must I tote the fucking iron 
Disconnect your spine leave your balky paralyzed 
I use blocks to bust heads 
I use glocks to play hotels to feds 
Niggaz know I ain't the one to be roughed on 
move when I'm coming through or you'll get stepped on 
I don't give a mother fuck if you got your vest on 
I'm shooting through that I thought you knew that

Disrespect my mind fucking over you is a must

Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but I thought eleven would be sweeter
Cause she wanted me to see her
Said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
Left Ne-Ne with Macita
Vroom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how I'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak
They say she keep it cleaned up
But I don't want HIV brah
Take her straight to the sheets 
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her I'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya

[Turk]
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call
See if it's alright
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
She didn't know I knew Wayne was already hitting it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog running out
He saw me dipping in but he didn't know what I'm bout
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Saying to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight me and the H-Beezey
I can't be late
I'm gone see ya when I could
Here's Juve on the hip
Let 'em know it was all good

[Juvenile]
Oh oh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
We done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cause she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smelling
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby momma beeping me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly

[B.G.]
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walking out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on them bolls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinking and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standing tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head
End up doing something bad ha

Holes in your shoes, and your body all funky

Where I stay, times is hard for a lot of my peeps
Some of my rounds doin' bad.. can't even much eat
Everytime I pass through, beggin' me for a dollar
Thinkin' I owe them somethin', don't even want to holla
Nigga who use ta be ballin' ain't ballin' no mo'
I can see they life fadin' away slowly for sure
Niggas who I come up with get me full of that dope
Use ta care about theyself, ain't care no mo'
Niggas want me ta help 'em.. ain't helpin' theyself
You must be out your mind if you ain't helpin' yourself
Ain't no love loss... I just gotta stay my distance
Gotta keep my mind straight.. before I come up missin'
Gotta do my rap thing, and make my paper, mister
Ain't gon' let nobody stop me from gettin' my six figures
Gettin' my shine on, bling-blingin' everyday
If you're not for tha right, stay tha fuck out my way, nigga

(Chorus 2x)

[B.G.]
Everytime I hit tha block, it look like it get worse
Make me wonder if V.L. and Magnolia got a curse
My niggas still my niggas... got love for 'em all
I hate to see that market ride they back and make 'em fall
Somebody tell me, if I didn't have change and I was broke
Would I get tha same attention when I'm in tha next four-door
No, I don't think so, I'll be a equal nigga
On the set, smokin' jo's, beggin' people for scrilla
On the reala... if I could do it, then you could
Lay your hustle down and make your way out the hood
Ain't nobody gon' give no hand-outs, I swear
Ain't nobody gon' pay tha bills in your house, I swear
They don't care, ya gotta stand on your own, my nigga
You ain't no child, look in tha mirror, you're grown, my nigga
Do yourself a favor: leave tha heroin alone, my nigga
And get your hustle on, nigga, get it on, my nigga

(Chorus 4x)

[Juvenile talking]
Man, you could be out here tryin' ta do somethin', man
I mean everytime we come through, man, I do somethin' for my people, man
I give tha little kids a dollar or so, ya know what I'm sayin'
I try ta do things for tha football team
Try ta take care of my people
Try ta show them how ta help theyself

Yo, I write rhymes, for niggas at night time
Consider your life mine
Whether you pumpin 5 packs or 5 dimes
My time I'm livin' it, my persona eminent
Real niggas don't keep beef we finish it
No retreat, no surrenderin
No rockin me to sleep
I keep the heat up in my premises
A whole different level of rhyme several of my
Competitors try comin better than mine
Verbally I'm way ahead of my time, Mega
Immortalized through words
Son I'm livin off the time you served
Stay focused, keep a eye open for straight vultures
Everybody gotta go, everydays a day closer
I'm soakin in my sofa, Reminiscin Tony coked up
Life is fucked up, even when you blow up

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Lil Wayne: Who can ya trust?
Mega: Only a few and my nine will bust
Lil Wayne: What do you lust?
Mega: The money and the power nigga
Lil Wayne: Who you respect?
Mega: All my niggas that's no longer with us
And all the drug king pins who showed us how ta get up

[Cormega]
Who's the nicest nigga spittin a trife shit
Ghetto drama, Sagas for niggas with enditements, flippin white shit
Screamin fuck the feds
Squeezing ya heat at police till your cuffed to your hospital bed
Thug general, write rhymes for criminals to listen to
If you ain't real, my shit ain't even meant for you
My pen stain the paper like blood
My mind is like a nine and my rhyme is like a slug
Before I snitch like a bitch, I'd rather die like a thug
If they arraign me for bangin I throw my sign up at the judge, I'm almighty
Defy me, feel the 44 beside me
Red light to guide me to your vital point
With my heat I anoint you a second from death
My only regret, is that I emptied out my whole clip in your soul BIATCH

[Chorus]

[Cormega]
To my thugs, its unconditional love I'm givin you
I've been out the motha fuckin system too
Hunger pains when I was younger made me ready 2 face
Consequences of life the streets fed me
Ready rock chop the pumped I bought my high top dunks
And crack fiends only a baby nah, hold up
The sense of shit I just made up in the rhyme this is the realness
In a reflection of a sinner I spit
Yo feel this, my name alone had me maintainin a phone
On a come through not to mention the banger I hold
Ain't nothing new why would I front for you
I'm a felony offender, you showin your jealousy nigga

In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health

Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America 
And in my hood the laws are scared of us, we are too terrible 
If I live to be old, it's a miracle 
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical 
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo 
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you 
Don't blame me, society changed me 
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar 
Cut off lights, we masked riders 
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake 
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

My name still B.G., we it's said it rang a bell
In rich neighborhoods, middle class hoods, & jails
I'm a street nigga, sold ounces of crack cocaine
If I spit it, I did it, before I got in this rap game
One of my hobbies is beef, do that for pleasure
It's nothin' to bust a head, put a few wholes in ya sweater
Never get in a situation wit me involvin' guns
Never able to sleep always on tha run
One way or another you gonna come
Outta isolation, if it mean killin' ya ??
You thinkin' cause I'm rappin' & be on television
That I won't soften ya head & come split it
Close range is fake, bustin' from a distance

If any nigga want it, can get it wit no problem

Give a fuck about a nigga, hit 'em wit fifty rounds

Grew up around killas, hung wit tha big dawgs
Nigga we play it raw as it go, were I stay
Run ya mouth too much, get found in a hall way
Wit a head shot, look that's how niggas get it
Keep it on a tuck, nobody know who did it
No evidence, no witness, you just assed out
Busta ass nigga, you just assed out

Wet you up & have you bitches blood runnin' like douches

Can't go out the state so I can't take no vacation

Got to watch my conversation cause them people a fool
Got to be in before 11 and I can't miss school
But I was talkin' to that nigga sammy
Tryin' to see how I'm a get these 20 bricks from miami

On a chip phone so I'm thinking they ain't tracin' mine
Two days later I'm in that place facing 99

And he kept fightin' and he got me out appeal

Ask the lord to guide me right keep my mind of bad
Got this monkey ride my back tellin' me to a bad
Got a judge front a nigga tryin' to send me away
'Cause I got my second gun charge possession of a A-K

Now I'm due for sometime 15 with a bail
But I refuse to take that cause I'll never get well
But I promise if the lord hold me from under this
Ain't got to worry about me coming back for shit

Never thought when I get older they would offer me 10
I was waiting for my uncle come home looking like I would meet him in the pin
I ain't let em worry me real is what I've been
Now I'm on my third strike but I'm a hit the streets again

Shoulda kept it too himself but instead he told Elan

You see the game is got these niggaz hurtin'

The money's nervous, so they try'na get at me for service - Let's make it happen

I'm only askin' for dime a ki' - 5 for half

Quarters go 3 - you do the rest of the math

And nigga offer me 55 so I figure he ballin'

But at my prices the average hustler with dough can afford

But I'ont know this ol' nigga so I'ma tax him 60 g. bandits

The extra 5 for shippin'-n-handlin'

When I met him, he in all black, talking 'bout he be back

Told me ta stay here while he get the stacks

","Jack Who, Take What",2003
The Hot Club of Cowtown,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999
The Hot Club of Cowtown,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team

With some or other passions

And bought the girl some flowers

And nothing now could stop her

I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better

We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
And little kicks inside her

This morning at four fifty
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another

And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier

No more nights nappies smelling

The Hour Glass,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

Oh, I don't, I don't want anybody
No, I don't, I don't want anybody

Oh, it's not a different day
Ray is on her own
It's a hot and sunny day

We believe in systems and the day
We believe in love

So find the State of Israel, find the State of Rome

Crush the fools, in huts of clay, there's danger in the garden
Take me to your Station, take me through your mind
Drop that code you give me, just let me feel your mind
Take me through the evening, on my 32nd floor

And I'll never ask for more

As she saluted to the military band
Most of the people failed to see
She had a broken bottle in the other hand
And she took them by surprise
When she took them by the throat

But they shook it all off
With a nervous laugh and cough
""Next time,"" she said ""I'll let those people choke""

Smiled so much they failed to take a breath
And even when their kids were starving

And ran her hands right through her hair
So if the lady took the time to call
All the houses on the street would not compare

That she hadn't any money
But those she looked up to, they had
But they shook it all off

Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose

And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And then we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And go back to the kitchen sink

And helped the countryside to breathe
Ripped up fields, bullied flocks
And worked his workers right around the clock

And pigeons fly
And papers lie

There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses

The Human League,"In the town
The start of day
The father thinks in sadness
On why his daughters went away
On youth and other madness

I know we don't choose who we love
And malice is so human
When your principle's no good
It's time to find a new one
I was brought up to believe
That to avoid disaster
In life as in your dreams
You've got to be the monster
When you've done your very best
When things turn out unpleasant
When the best of men take bribes
Isn't it the fool who doesn't?

And near this place
There is a space

You've got your keys to get back in
You've washed your face so you can smile
You've got your pockets full of lending cash
Your ticket to the ladies mile
You brush away a flake of zinc
Advance toward the street outside
You close your mind so you can't think
The hide, the ride, the tide

But the scenes come rushing in
Like eels into your net
And it's just like Joseph said
Another walk you can't forget
But you push into the bleak
Where all the women walk in fear
Another three-word phrase
The near, the clear, the dear

You're a lonely little girl
Who just wants to please her dad
So you thought you'd be a nurse
Just like your mother had
But you make the patients worse
And the doctors know you're bad

Is a message on your phone
It says where you go

But you want to speak of love

Go hand in glove

Is a face on your wall
It says where you go

The Human League,"Someone stopped the clock when we should have started early
If we miss the morning meeting our lives will be in danger
Someone's trying to stop us, there is someone in our party
It is someone with a grudge and they won't let us reach the border

Our lives are in his hands, we pay with Krugerrands
The currency of pain to help us leaving
While back in our homeland the ones who make a stand
Are taken from their homes and no one hears of them again

I felt I had to come here, I thought things would be better
The situation's changed but I find I'm still resented
Someone wants my job it is someone in this building
Someone's spreading rumors and I don't feel I can stay here

I think I'm going north and now's the time to leave
The people there they say are good to strangers
And if I do my best and try to settle in
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor

I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor",Dreams of Leaving,1980
The Human League,"When you fall into your seat
You know you feel you might be dying
As the breath rasps in and out
Of your burning throat
You can't control your lungs because you're so tired
You're half awake with one arm in your coat
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you
You know you couldn't make it on your own
He helps you through the door
You sit down on the floor
And you're asleep before you are alone

[Chorus: x2]
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills

For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided
The day is over and the moon is high
But your period of work is predecided
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you
You know you couldn't make it on your own
He helps you in the door
You sit down as before
Another shift to pay another loan

It leaves me breathless
I see your dreams come true
You're not so restless
Or light, or bright
Marianne
One day I might not care
What happened to me
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me
I've got a life of my own
I remember the day I thought we couldn't lose
Running round the garden in your mother's shoes
Playing with your sisters
I didn't see you were a grown up girl
And bringing me tea
But is it life in a grown up world
On a cold autumn day
Is it life, someone's wife
When the car had broken down
The best of my girls
I didn't see you were a grown up girl
Oh how I hate the celebration
But you give it all away leaving me on my own
But is it life in a grown up world
I can't wait for the end of the celebration
Is it life, someone's wife
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life
That goes on as before
One day I might not care
What happens to me
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me
I've got a life of my own
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life

Then panic occurs, no seeds to spill
What's the matter now

Around the nation, around the world
What's been going down?
A million voices, one question hurled
Heard in every town
All of the people, one simple plea
What will happen now?
Asked in concern for their destiny
Got to know somehow
They say
They say
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
I saw the sign
So if you want to know what's going on
Going round and round
You'd better ask before your world is gone
Gone without a sound
They say
They say
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
I saw the sign
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
I saw the sign

It's hard I know to understand
Nothing lasts for ever
The things you used to say and do
The places you would go to meet
When you were together
You set your face against the tide
The harsh words that were spoken
But after all the anger
The shouting and the tears
You found your heart was broken
Fight the tears
Fight the fever
Don't give in
Soul deceiver
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
Just like the clock went back ten years
To make a new beginning
To work out how to live your life
To take the board and play the game
And recognise you're winning
Your memories mean nothing now
You're just a little older
Moving forward with the crowd
Silent fears but laughing loud
Not wiser but just bolder
Fight the tears
Fight the fever
Fight the hurt
Don't give up
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died

Too scared for what he had to say.

Or stay awhile,
As if we were still lovers?

And, as he started to apologise,
Lose any bitterness she bore.

To let him know she understood,
And, with her suitcase standing on the floor,
Embraced him like a lover would.

""You look so good;
It's just, you see,
You make me feel
As if we were still lovers.""

There are wounds that you don't wanna heal.
The memories of something really good,
Something truly real, that you never found again.

Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign,
That told him all he had to know.

When all the money's gone
When all the boys move on
No star to wish upon
When every race is run
In the quiet of the morning
Lying in the morning sun
Ruins of another country
Day has just begun
Blown by the desert breeze
No memory of trees
No mercy from the sky
No avenue to try
In the quiet of the morning
Lying in the morning sun
Ruins of another country
Day has just begun
When all the money's gone
When all the boys move on
No star to wish upon
When every race is run
In the quiet of the morning
Lying in the morning sun
Ruins of another country

Got the keys to my car
But I don't want to go nowhere

I'm not at all bored
But I've plenty of time to spare

Would take me there

There's more than friendship in my eyes

Hanging out with the cool and free

You can act like a monarch
Or a pillar of the bourgeoisie

How about a little sympathy

Of such principles / From never doing wrong at all / To scandal inconceivable /
I'm pounding at the gates of hell / Impatient for the journey in / I'll face

Join us, come and join us

There is a path that's crystal clear
It guides the wise away from here
In summer's hazy atmosphere
Or wintertime

The more the merrier they say
The moors stretch out along the way
By glow of night, by light of day
Just read the signs

'Til we can see the smoke rise in the distance
Reminding us of home not far behind
Careering through the path of least resistance
We're going on a journey of the mind

From the town to the country

Come and join us
Come and join us
From the valley to the hillside
From the upside to the down

Join us, come and join us

Surprised the damned, by mouth of toad
A shop where you cannot reload

The way to Hyde, the sixty-two or six two eight
Will do if you cannot be late
Sometimes the only choice to make
In wintertime

We gaze upon the face of the Apollo
We know that we approach our journey's end
And still we will be home before tomorrow
But we will rise before we must descend

From the town to the country
From the country to the town

Before the soldiers came
The life was cheap on bread and wine
And sharing meant no shame

Of rockets flying from nearby
And scared she clings onto her dreams
To beat the fear that she might die

Before he leaves the camp he stops
He scans the world outside
And where there used to be some shops
Is where the snipers sometimes hide

But now he finds he is at war
Weren't we supposed to keep the peace

It seemed to wipe away the years
Her face was older, just a little rough
But her eyes were still so clear

He drank his coffee and he hurried out
Across before she walked away
Then he approached her like a little child
Too scared for what he had to say

""Hello, Louise, Remember me?
Now should we part or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognize
The man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologize
Lose any bitterness she bore

She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told Louise, ""You look so good
It's just you see, you make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real that you never found again

As if we were still lovers

And though they talked for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

The Human League,"And after such a blazing day
At last the breeze began to play
I drained my glass and turned to see
Her face she smiled she spoke to me
I told her my name I asked her the same
She said they call me sky
Sky
Said she is in danger maybe a stranger
Might know a place near by
And she talked and she smoked little more than a job
All the cares of my life went away on that day
In that room coming out of the gloom
And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on
Life goes on
Now you gone
Life goes on after sky
Life goes on after sky
So much can change without a sign
A twist of fate two worlds alight
The words get spoken all worlds were broken
The wind began to sign
The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake
Too soon the last goodbye
And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies
For the day of my birth was the last day on earth
Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light
I could see what I've done what must be from now on
Life goes on 
Now you're gone 
Life goes on after sky

You open doors, you realize

It's dead and gone
Gave it everything, but it's the

Program your head
Then you breed

Magnify and glorify
Squeeze the juice

Life takes a little piece of you away
Most everyday of your life
Oh learn to get wise, you learn to compromise-
You learn to criticise yourself
I guess we all grow up 'cause one day everything-
Seems so further from the truth
And you try to find yourself- in this endless youth
I said you try to find yourself-and you
Beg a little love

Fate takes another stab at your face
And you can never cease to resist
And you take it on the chin-that old sucker punch again
Reminds you what you've missed
When the colors blazed and your jealousy raged
You were so sensitive to every touch
And it ain't to forget in this endless youth
So you find a perfect stranger- and you
Beg a little love

What do you get in the end
Did you really need that friend
Your emotions dulled to save your heart
From failing at the hardest part
But you still get down on your knees
I said you get down n your knees
And you beg

Now there's nothing left to laugh at
Nothing left to say-nothing left do
There's nothing left-so there's nothing left to ask for
But you still get down on your knees- and you beg

These words are my sacrificial lamb
Burnin' a hole down my heart
Dancin' down that river of no return
You know you missed that boat- but you still get
Down on your knees

Afterall o' those years
Afterall o' those fears
Afterall o' those dreams
Afterall o' those screams
Aferall o' those nights
Afterall o' those fights

The city will be earth in a short while
If I'm not mistaken it's been in flames
You and I will escape to the seaside

There is a storm in the distance
The wind breathing warning of its imminence
There is a lighthouse five hundred yards down
You and I will be safe there

There is a girl who haunts that lighthouse
She saved me, I was swimming
So young I almost drowned
Under the water she sang a story
Of losing her lover
She calls a warning

Love, you are foolish, you're tired
Your sleeplessness makes you a liar
The city is burning
The ocean is turning
Our only chance is the lighthouse

Her lover was a sailor
She went and she waited there
The door locked from the outside
Lover never arrived so she sings there
Soft as a siren luring the ships off their course, how alarming

We went in, we climbed up and looked out
The door locked from the outside

I don't know how I'm still hungry
But they don't know how the IRS hung me
What do you do when they take all of your money
Get gram like gumby come back like a bungee
All of my grief it is making me unleash
On a bum all my opponents will cease
So I'm yelling to the north, and the south, and the west and the east
I'm motherfukin' beast
When you don't have nothing
Only have the way that you go its still mad tough
And the crowd stuff, the lab book, and notes with the bad luck
And the flash up with the cash stuffed up in the bag
And you gotta get it no matter what
Don't give that money to put enough in your gut
I gotta be the killer because I'ma stunt [?] leave us in the dust
The ruthless, killed my mother
Something really stupid, feel my brothers
And I'm beginning to treat my ill like others
With real life smothers, I feel like thuggers
So bang, try to my way up in the gang, with the pain I write this
I came to ice ya, a ring to nice ya
She hanging knifeless, I'm stranger, hey bitch I aim when I spit
For the winning I'm gonna increase
The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me
Because I gotta eat, I won't let the demons release, kill me
Son of a feast your gonna need a bishop of the priest
I am that monster coming to get you to say the least

The Hype,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
""Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain",Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud,2000

It's going down, Hypnotize Camp Posse
You did this nigga, shit talkin'

Crop a mix with Smilax, take a gun and cock it back
Now I'm 'bout to blow my brains out 'cause I don't give a shit
Hope you give a nigga reason to want ya, the bigger gun the better
The more shit you talk, the more blood the sweata'

Forgot about the peddlers, we still in it together

Let me introduce myself, my fuckin' nigga
I'ma be the one to pull that fuckin' trigga
I'ma be the one that's sent to fuckin' getcha
You better watch out 'cause I'll paint a picture

C.B. nigga, ain't leavin' no witness

Yeah, make me a believer nigga
Make some shit this bumpin you fuckin' wannabes, Lord roll

I am the predator you are the prey
You play the target, Lord play the gage
You play bitches and I mack hoes
You run from niggaz, I find the snub nose
I come from 3 6 picture platinum clique
And you can't sell three copies of your shit
You smoke garbage weed, and cheap packs a blow
You own a vehicle, pick up the Scarecrow

Frayser Boy, cockin' toy, ya'll don't wanna fuck with me
Infared got ya scared in protective custody
The Unbreakables, the most hateable, the unescapeables
Time to bust a nigga head, we aren't hesitateable
Ya chest pumped out, mouth talkin' that shit
I'm from the Bay, I'ma show you how a nigga beat a bitch
Time to damage shit, no understandin' this, you know you scandalous
HCP blowin' your lights out like a candle, bitch

Well I'm about to rich rip a hole in the industry, holdin' my energy
Wasn't about to let it, but you had to come testin' me
Givin you one warning change your name before I get your crunk
Lyrically copyrighted all my shit, and plus I'll fuck you up
You don,t want to have to cross the path a killers when you on the streets
HCP got WYT to the E and that's just how it be
Quit ya muthafuckin' hatin' playin' all your petty games
If you wanted to ride my nuts that bad you should've asked me man

Danger, you muthafuckas wanted a war bitch, then I'ma bring it on
Catch you in these fuckin' streets, boy and I'ma point the chrome
Put you in the fuckin' car, hoe, and we gon' take you home
To hell with all that cryin' now, nigga we gonna get it on
Beat you with that yawk, dead center across your damn dome
The way you ran your mouth, you should've known to have the fuckin' tone
Beggin' from beginning, man winnin' 'cause our camp is strong
The same way your skull started dentin 'cause we beat it long you niggaz

Swear you have the right plan but you had the wrong mans
Tryin to build a clique like the hypnotize camp
I'm knowin' it wouldn't work so I just sit back
And watch how the trains just runs off the track
'Cause it be to many loses, to many bosses
Too many niggaz that's wantin' they own office
You niggaz gotta realize who got the city owned
Three Six fuckin' Mafia not these damn hoes

Y'all can't fuck with this
Y'all can't fuck with this

And managed to find a seat
Then I went out dancing with my Miss Garbo
Tried my best to not step on her feet

And the staircase is a mountain
And the window is a cliff
In the morning the weather found 'em
Both my hands were cold and stiff
Till I put ’em together

Put my hands together
Don’t know how, I’ve got the nearest pair

Insisted on rolling on the floor

Makes his usual excuse
As the night loves to fall apart

Give my regards to midnight
Tell him he ain’t changed a bit
Long, tall, dark and handsome
Still lonely as shit

It’s not welcome in my room
And the pillows are exhausted
To hold my head again so soon

And they cut off your welfare check

And I went to meet my man
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street
At the Pioneer Chicken stand

The I-10 Chronicles,"I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi.
My girlfriend blows a boozy good-bye kiss.
I see flying squirrels and nightmares of stigmata.
Then awakening to find my Trans-Am gone.
Still, I'm feeling pretty good about the future.
Yeah, everything is peaches but the cream.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
I see the guitar that my cousin played in prison,
Floating with the tv in the swimming pool.
I'm calling for the owner of the motel,
Then noticing the bloodstain on the door.
I'm reaching for the shoes under the bushes,
Just in time to hear the sirens sing.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
You know freedom's just a stupid superstition,
'cause life's a highway that you travel blind.
It's true that having fun's a terminal addiction.
What good is happiness, when it's just a state of mind?
For in the prison of perpetual emotion,
We're all shackled to the millstone of our dreams.
Me, I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things are always better than they seem.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

Or such great rising words, as uttering overmuch
Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay

Accept all happiness from me

Taking on the world,

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done

So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

Heaven's just the place we're gonna be

And there's certain words that we've not spoken yet
So spread your wings of love like an angel from above
I promise you won't give more than you get, so

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 

First it was nothin', not even, a fake ? 
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along 
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes 
Thought I'd never feel this way again 
And you were supposed to reach my heart 
And find love within, love, love 
Oooh...oooh 

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love 
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me 
Wonderful 

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near 
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared 
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend 
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again 

Fall in love again, in a storm 
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses) 

Just when I thought I'd seen it all 
Our paths crossed, amen 
And I knew, from the first glance 
That you, would be hard to forget 
Your eyes, attracted me first 
But you reeked of sultry confidence 
I couldn't wait, to touch lips 
And kiss, with my heart's intention 
When we didn't, was what I expected 
And for that moment, we erased the tension 
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters 
And the initial blind date, first impressions 
We kissed again; and I felt the passion 
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin' 

We made love, within a storm 
In the midst of passion and chaos 
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost 
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder 
Those who prevail this drama 
Will learn to bring their love farther 
But now, the storm has past 
And the seas of our friendship are gone 
But as long as I live, I will remember 
The love within a storm 

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line) 
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love 
Ya know that I miss you, and love you 
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart 
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice

There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession

Has been shattered by the closing of the door

The Imperials Quartet,"I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in, 
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above, 
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole. 

Now let us, have a little talk with Jesus, 
Let us, tell him all about our troubles, 
He will, hear our faintest cry, 
And he will, answer by and by
Now when you, feel a little pary'are wheel turning, 
And you, know a little fire is burning.
You will, find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. 

Sometimes my path seems drear,without a ray of cheer, 
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way. 

I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears, 
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to m in prayer, he knows my every care, 
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.",Just a Little Talk With Jesus,2005

The Impossibles,"Fell asleep in the van
With a crick in my neck and a yearning in my brain
Making myself homesick looking at your photograph
I do the best that I can to keep myself in check
But it's easy to complain when our home sits
On the binding of the u.s. page of the road atlas side 26
Coast to go and I'm holding my breath
Squeasin' my spider-man pillow to death
I can see your eyes when I hold mine closed so tightly

absence will make your heart grow fonder
All of my dreams will come true
And if your heart starts to falter
I will tell you what I'll do...

hold my breath all night
Clench my fists so tight
Wish with all my might
That I'll never fear
Grit my teeth too hard
Travel very far
Wish upon the stars
That I'll never...

I never feared you with
Thoughts of you near me

I camped out by the phone
Putting scratches in my notebook
And waiting up until dawn
Humming this song back and forth
Over and over again

I do the best that I can to keep myself in check
But it's easy to complain when our home sits
On the binding of the u.s. page of the road atlas

absence will make your heart grow fonder
All of my dreams will come true
And if your heart starts to falter
I will tell you what I'll do...


Hold my breath all night
Clench my fists so tight
Wish with all my might
That I'll never fear
Grit my teeth too hard
Travel very far
Wish upon the stars
That I'll never...

I never feared you with
Thoughts of you near me

I sleep as much as I can and hold my heart in my hand
It's as much as I can stand
My weakness comes out once again

hold my breath all night
Clench my fists so tight
Wish with all my might
That I'll never fear

hold my breath all night
Clench my fists so tight
Wish with all my might
That I'll never fear
Grit my teeth too hard
Travel very far
Wish upon the stars
That I'll never...

Oh no, I pray that i`m enough to make you stay...(no way)

Might take a bruise or two before she longs for my abuse
Running away was easy, I guess, but you left my mind a sloppy mess
Was it so hard to talk about the stuff that I could not figure out?
Woe, woe is me, she took her things and she ran away, woe, woe is me (yea yea yea!)
She says she's feeling so much better
She says the air tastes so much sweeter since she left me
Sometime I might suspect that the cause couldn't be as bad as the effect
Crazy girls which I seem to collect and scribble down notes like a science project
Your argument has no defense, its' a big fat lie built on false pretense
But now I roam from home to work singing songs about you and feeling like a jerk
Woe, woe is me, she took her things and she ran away, woe, woe is me (yea yea yea!)

You've got a friend in me.

You feel you're not wanted anywhere.

There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.

The Impossibles,"Some summer Sunday
Drifting between sleep and waking
Your absence brought me to
Sick feelings filled me
Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss,
Motionless
We never said goodbye
When we gave in, but we don't mind
If we never say goodbye,
There'll be no end, there'll be no end

Stream of consciousness
Leads me to drowning dreams
Looking up, you're colored baby-blue
The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in,
Remember then, remember when you let me in
Hold on, hold on, we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other

Tearing my heart apart, yours ticks without a tear
Slow down, I haven't moved at all
The cold can't kill us but we won't survive the fall

Slipping, falling away
Hold on day to day, year to year, from here to there

Poison my speaking voice with half-truths and denials
Converting oxygen by living, breathing, suffering, screaming

We can't, we can, we will, we will, we won't
Slow down

Her promise was almost undone
Under her tongue, dissolving her responsibilities
To finally deny everyone with unflattering comparison

And you hate all the people that you used to adore
And you despise all the rumors and lies of the life you led before

You want to just lay down and die
If all of this life has been such a big disappointment to you
Why don`t you stop blaming some guy
And go give the next one a try

Clutching the covers to her throat

You wrote""

One of the chosen few, did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie, I can't satisfy

Seems I can't satisfy your  love, I can't satisfy

You seem so complete, so petite and sweet
But never do I know just which way you're gonna go
Sometimes I wonder why, why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside swallow up all of my pride

But I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy
No, no, no, no, no, I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy

Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them

Just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there is no hiding place against the kingdoms throne
