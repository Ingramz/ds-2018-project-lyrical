The Fixx,"As I wake today same as yesterday
I get in my car the poor turn my wheels
There's so much today, who's got time to listen?
As we fulfill our dreams the shame is left unseen

Why should someone lose so that I get by?
Why should someone pay just to send me high?

[Chorus]
No one has to cry while I can smile
No one owns the sky so blue above you
Somewhere in this world
There's a field where we all play
The secret's in your eyes
No one has to cry

There's no self-control as we play our roles
It's all dog eat dog, we're all dressed for show
As we plot and scheme full of American dreams
Who says it's fair who gets the opportunities?

There are some who live without so that I get by
They pay the price for doubting just to send me high.

[Chorus]",No One Has to Cry,1991
The Fixx,"The sailor walks across the ocean
Unsafe on waves of glass
Any time dark skies could open
And he could perish at the mast

[Chorus]
His stomach turns
The potion burns
He's lifting every stone
Money comes, and money goes
But man must always have a home
Money comes, and money goes
Man could never be alone.

Hunter in his leafy temple
Monkeys sing the lions ride
Jungle tempting with example
His gun always by his side

[Chorus]

Astronaut on a traveled plan
Searching for his other man
The plastic pawn is in his hand
And in the other is a looking glass

[Chorus]",One Jungle,1991
The Fixx,"It could happen to you
It could happen to me or anyone
Treading the mill, coming-of-age, and it falls undone
Here you stand, are you lost for sure?
It could happen to you
It could happen to me or anyone

[Chorus:]
It's all about class, have you got a ticket?
It's all about worth, should we really buy it?
It's about time we shut it all out
It's about time we shut it all out

When it happens to you
It will happen to me and everyone
Part of the chain, we're holding hands
And I'm holding on
Dare we pick the last fruit from the tree?
If it belongs to you it belongs to me and everyone

[Chorus:]",Shut It Out,1991
The Fixx,"I love the breeze
The one I miss is in the breeze
You are the breeze
I love the water
The one I miss is in the water
You are the water
I love the life
The one I miss is in the life
You are my life
Now I am possessed
The one I miss is my possession
Maybe you're still around
Maybe you could still be found
I love the life
The one I miss is in the life
You are the life
I'm in distress
The one I want is my distraction

[Chorus:]
Maybe you're still around
Maybe you could still be found
What can I do or say
To see there's no holding back?
Seeing this old place reminds me, maybe you're still around.

I love the child
The child I kiss is in the man
You are the child
I am possessed
What I want is my possession

[Chorus]",Still Around,1991
The Fixx,"Any road, any bed
Another stitch in the tapestry
Any plate, any soap
Another hope, same anatomy
Any day, any job
You're still in my memory
Another note to another song
I love what you do to me

[Chorus:]
I'll jump the train to make that step
I'll make the plane to fly away
Send it high, so high
We can turn around
Yesterday, today was tomorrow

Here and now is all that I can be
We can play beg, steal or borrow
It's okay, we can find a way
Any door, a reason why
Another window to another sky
Another heart lies just the same
We are together just to ease the pain

[Chorus:]","Yesterday, Today",1991
The Fixx,"How much is enough?

Good enough, is not good enough
Don't complain that you've got it tough
With all you have, your life's a bore
Can't relax, you want so much more
Blind needs won't set you free
Can't you see that time is slipping away? But I got to say

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough, is enough

Gravity may bring you down
But harmony could spin you 'round
Information Ariel says buy buy buy material
Give take all day long
Can't you see it's hopeless being strong
When you live it wrong?

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough? How much is enough?
Buy buy buy, buy buy buy

So give me your attention, I know it's getting late
While we were dreaming, something slipped away
We're drowning in possessions, playing tricks with our minds
Lost from one another, baby put your hand in mine
Time is slipping away, but it's not too late

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough?

How much is enough? How much is enough?
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough? How much is enough?
How much is enough? How much is enough?
How much is enough? How much is enough?",How Much Is Enough,1991
The Fixx,"Talking about stealing the show no one would know
Talking about stealing the show when they're all letting go
Take a look at the witch see the twitch in her eye tell me
what did she feel
Is this the way of the world take a boy and a girl show them
lying is real
Then I see t he edge I look I fall
Deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall there's no place to hide
you better take the call
Deeper and deeper
Is it the smell of the oil the sweat and the toil that makes
living unreal
The yuppie in the suit the man with a flute what did he steal
It's beginning to break there is a mistake nowhere to go
A fool and his blood in the wrong neighborhood what price
does he pay
The further I see
I see the edge I look I fall
The further I see the further I fall
There's no place to hide anymore",Deeper and Deeper,1994
The Fixx,"Crying parents tell their children
If you survive, don't do as we did
A son exclaims there'll be nothing to do to
Her daughter says she'll be dead with you

While foreign affairs are screwing us rotten
Line morale has hit rock bottom
Dying embers stand forgotten
Talks of peace were being trodden

Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight

Is this the value of our existence
Should we proclaim with such persistence
Our destiny relies on conscience
Red or blue, what's the difference

Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight

It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre

Desecrate the population

State your peace tonight

The Fixx,"The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say?
You've got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet, why don't they:

Do what they say, say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another.

The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see comes from living close
To your fears
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover and there's heat, why don't they:

Do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
One thing leads to another

Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough

Bigger the harder he falls
But when the wrong antidote is like a bulge on the throat
You runs for cover in the heat why don't they

Do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You tell me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another",One Thing Leads to Another [Special Remix Version],1995
The Fixx,"Big ideals I can't suppress
Little lies I do detect
Through pleasure, pain, delight and wonder
But there's the rub of irony
Where indecision slices me
From high of highs, it pulls me under

There will always be two different views
Of the same thing baby
Two many views that can collide
There will always be those two different views
Too many views with loaded pride

Emotions sway from side to side
Devotion preys upon my pride
I will respect the winner in the battle for my mind
These jealousies and dumb regrets
Wasting time just beckons death
Here today and gone tomorrow

There will always be two different views
Of the same thing baby
Two many views and reasons why
There will always be those two different views
Too many views to satisfy

As I stray from either side
Too confused to fantasize
Like a judge who needs forgiveness

But is there peace for two as one?
What divides can be undone
Regain the pulse of what was priceless

There will always be two different views
There will always be two different views
There will always be two different views

Big ideals I can't suppress
Little lies I do detect
Through pleasure, pain, delight and wonder

Emotions sway from side to side
Devotion preys upon my pride
Will I respect the winner in the battle for my mind?",Two Different Views,1998

The Fixx,"Are you satisfied?
With the way things are
Knowing that you never dared and care only now
You seem polarized by your own sense of doubt
Attracting only negative thoughts
Positive your lucks run out
Are you satisfied?
With the turn of events
Peeling onions to mask the pains tears and
Fears you try to circumvent
You seem hypnotized by all that's man made and shallow
Follow you must or else you life feels
Send yourself to sleep lose yourself in dreams
You'll never know until you breathe
Realize that tomorrow things may be fine
In your eyes; I'll see that my life through your eyes
Here tonight don't you know
That Things could turn out right
Are you satisfied?
By your civilizations a saddled broken horse
Pulling a cart load of premonitions to manure the road
Of others peoples visions
This cultures vulture will pick the bones
Of your decisions
Send yourself to sleep
Lose yourself in dreams

Realize that tomorrow news may be fine in your eyes
I'll see that my life through your eyes here tonight
Don't you know, oh, yeah that things could turn out right

Knowing that you never dared did you care up and down?

for layers of words, let me say it in terms that you can understand

Move faster than me, then I recognize

And Compton is still on my mind
I remember when we used to get scared when they got behind us
One-time sayin' they been tryin' to find us
But they got the wrong niggas, never mind us

Rip out the stinger, you keep talkin' shit I whip out the ringer

right before 12:00 A.M., why you packin' a Slim Jim?

Time travel
And, yes!
Enter away message text here.

I say that time travel
Really does already exist
But not through the sciences

And through physics
But it exists within the power 
Of our own minds
To illuminate our own memories
And now through some 
Subliminal hypnotic state of mind
One can recede back 

Into one's own previous life
Not to extract precise, minute details
But to re-inhabit vague transcendental experiences of pre-existential, optimism
A time before any ability to reason 

Is actually set
A time before logic covers 
All the dimensions of our thinking
And if we're lucky
We can even dissolve back
To a time of glorious, superhuman 
Space and time
A time when all things seem possible",Time Travel... Yes!!,2006

The Flaming Lips,"Well this frog was hopping on down the road
He was thinking about courting
He had his hopes dashed too
He got squished by a car, but just his one leg
He thought, ""For making tadpoles
Just one leg ought to do""
He thought, ""Hm, I've been heart broke before
Left a hole you drive a truck through""
He hopped on down the road
A little bit further towards the truth

Now this one legged frog was just carrying on
He was thinking about courting
So he revised a sense of duty
He ran into a dog that hadn't eaten for days
And that dog bit his eye
But he missed with the bigger tooth
He said, ""I can see more clearly now
Desire has a way of getting you through
Oh, I know how you loved me back then
Now it's hard to face the truth""

Now this one-eyed, one-legged, determined ol' frog
He was thinking about courting
He jumped up on a log
Well, that log was infested
By some pissed off bees
And they stung their stingers
Wherever they could get them to
""Because I love you, what kind of hell do I put myself through?""
He hopped on down the road
There is no pain this way to the truth

And by the time he got to his amphibian mate
He was so scared of pain
He thought she'd just have to wait
But she was a demanding old toad and having none of that
He saw in her eyes, ""The truth is here at last""
""What kind of urge could take this lily pad to the moon?
The grand old urge, but how eyes and legs can I lose?
Pleasures so painful, it seems the joy is in the pursuit""
He hopped on down the road
Knowing he finally found some truth",The Tale of the Horny Frog,2007
The Flaming Lips,"As I walked along 
The supposed golden path 
I was confronted
By a mysterious specter
he pointed to the graveyard 
over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection
confused and wondering.
Of how I came to die to die... (to fade)
Hmmm I was confused 
For if I was dead 
how and why did I die?
but I composed myself 
and decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed 
on the supposed golden path.
and I was confronted 
by a powerful demon force
and they said it was the devil
and when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lava
from the mouth of a volcano
and I said help me lord ( to fade)
I found myself in some kind of hell
but I did not believe in a 
Heaven and hell world of opposite's kind of reality
and I gained control of myself
and I decided to press on
and as I walked along the supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear all the lions and wizards yet to come.
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high and the clouds
and voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb.
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you

And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you darling
Don't confess

Just let it remain me and your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
No, I really don't want to know

The Flashcats,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",Night Before Christmas,
The Flatlanders,"Trains cannot defeat me when I'm stoned little darling
Sticks and stones can beat you out of time
And I'm standing on the brink of a bridge that's black at sunrise
I don't think I'll be home in time to dine

Each plant has a root that's dipped in blood
So later on we'll all find out we're just nameless mud
And I'm sayin' good bye to those old-time demons darling
Leave at your own risk, not mine

Why can't you make it to the place you're always going to
Could it be you're going to all the time
Well I might be traveling backwards when I wake up tomorrow
If you must go won't you please leave me a dime

The earth turns on a Bhagavan decree
So later on we'll see ourselves and all be free
But sayin' goodbye to you is suicidal darling
Don't hang your mind up just where I hang mine

Life is a quarry you can dig all you want too
Rock and jump and ball go up or down
And you can burn your brain cells out just trying to get higher
But you'll find my highest place is underground

You say one day soon we will all stand as brothers
Till then I guess we'll just stand around",Bhagavan Decreed,1972

The damned old fool's caught out on the trestle
He can't go forward and he can't go back

In fact I had lived and gone to hell

Three ring circus rockin' round the sun
The taste of fire and Julia's name
Right there on the tip of my tongue

I was on the mountain
And the sun was goin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia

I kissed her on the mouth, I looked her in the eye
I's actin' half my age and feelin' way too proud
I drove into the desert, I drove up to the sky
I parked it and I left it just a hangin' on a cloud

I was empty-headed but my heart was full of love

I was on the mountain
Lightnin' all around
All I's lookin' for was Julia

The more you need her help the more she let's you down
The more you like the way she walks the more she shakes her hips
The more you fall in love with life the more she runs around
The more you fear the kiss of death the more she licks her lips

I was on the mountain
There was thunder rumblin' down
All I's listenin' for was JUlia

On a freeway full of smoke and haze
Where the power lines and fault lines double cross

And nothing's in the way until it gets in your face
It goes without saying that I must say
Some things are better left unsaid
Here and there
Gone everywhere
You may be just a-dreaming when you're
Waking up dead
Dying for love
Living in fear
Neither is a reason or rhyme
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

Somewhere beyond the dark and the dawn
Unsaid, unsung and unseen
Somewhere behind the back of your mind
Not beside, not before
Not even in between
Sitting in silence being in love
Looking for a mountain to climb
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

Some are denying it's just about time
Some don't believe in space
If you try to undo what's done been did
You'll mistake the static for the thrill of the chase
If time is money, space is credit
They're talking about it all over town
Are you rolling in the black or sinking in the red?
Is gravity the only thing that's holding you down?
It's hard to stop when you're picking up speed
Brother can you spare me a dime?
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

That no one would believe
Like there's never been a hand to hold
That no one would receive

[Chorus: x2]
There's never been a season yet
That never had an end
There's never been a reason yet
For lovers to pretend
There's never been a baby born
Without the eagle flying
Like there's never been a love been torn
Without one heart a-dying

There's never been a soul to know
A life without a fall
Like there's never been a love to grow
Where each did not give all

The Flatlanders,"Every night you and I catch a wandering eye
We stand out like trees in cotton rows
It ain't a look, it ain't a style we might throw
Down after a while
It's the way we are and that's the way it goes

[Chorus]
The way we are, the way we are
You might think we fell right off the same bright star, the way we are
Never had a dream so good to me so far
It don't leave nothing much to say, the way we are

I'd lost my mind riding on the 99
When you found me singing sad and low
And at the end of the track, you took my hand
And led me back
To the happy song I'd left so long ago

[Chorus]

It might be, I might say, we weren't born to be this way
There's a million ways they say and this I see
But it occurred to me last night, when I saw you standing in the moonlight
If I die this way that'll be okay with me

The way we are, the way we are
You might think we fell right off the same bright star, the way we are
Never had a dream so good to me so far
I never thought I would meet someone who
Would share a fate like ours
It don't leave nothing much to say the way we are",The Way We Are,2009
The Flatlanders,"Standing at a crossroad in the rain
I been here before, I can't complain
Must be something in the book of revelation
Keeps on messing with my destination

That big old city nearly did me in
I got my doubts if I'll go there again
Turning back could turn into a heartbreak
Tonight I just need some shelter from a heartache

[Chorus]
Wishing for a rainbow
Listen to the wind blow
Wondering how can love grow
Wishing for a rainbow

I wonder if she found her way to Denver
If she still needs the love I said I'd send her
Like roses untended may grow withered
Love letters in my heart go undelivered

[Chorus]

Shattered glass all scattered Ã¢??cross the floor
Some fellow left his suitcase by the door
I'd like to think I left it all behind me
And know for sure the past will never find me
There are some who sanctify revenge
Time and life will leave them on the fringe
And some until the end will carry grudges
Time and life and death will be their judges

[Chorus]",Wishing for a Rainbow,2009
The Flatliners,"


Every time I turn on the TV click to the news and I see is bad things happening
People dying and people killing
And everybody amplifying destruction and chaos all around the world
Every time I see it it makes my stomach curl

We've gotta make up for all the mistakes that have been made
And the way the media portrays the day
In the life of someone else as some stupid celebrity
The media takes a good story and pumps it full of evil
And I'm getting fed up with the whole deal
And everyday people are upset with the world itself
And I'm stuck in the middle of a growing trend
Where friends aren't friends until the end
They'll stab each other in the back for little recognition
Before they know what to do they're down to zero and nobody wants to know them

[Chorus:]
Freight train headed for me
And I can't see a thing
Freight train headed for me
Freight train of destruction like a punch in the face

News at 6 o'clock eleven eleven thirty
All I see is people dying
CNN and all the terrorists
When will this cycle of shit begin to end?

Every time I look at the news paper
I see the headlines saying things and jumping out at me
More modern war stories, more things to worry about
The list is piling up and it seems that I can't do a thing about it
The media makes fun of it and we have to live it

Every time I turn on the TV click to the news and I see it's some bad things happening
People dying and people killing
And everybody amplifying destruction and chaos all around the world
Every time I see it it makes my stomach curl

Y'all
Y'all!

On a gangsta tip
Freddie Foxxx in the house 
You know what I'm sayin'?

Rollin' with the Flava
We goin' set it off like this
Check it out

On the one...
Let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go
(Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go)
Yo, let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go, come on
(Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go)

(Get on the mic and get rough) 

I'm back again to wreck mics and threat the mic-holder
I'm still hardcore gettin mines, like I told ya
I still keep a gun on my waistline, clip in a fat rhyme
Shoot you in the chest with the tec, in the head with the nine

You rappers can't swing the Freddie Foxxx style
Man, I make the softest nigga think he's buckwild
I never won a Grammy, never made a hit
But everytime a rapper get on stage with Freddie Foxxx, he get his ass whipped

I break em down daily
My voice so ill, I make Barry White sound like Philip Bailey
You rappers don't faze me with the rough talk 
Boy, you better back up and pack up 

Before I load the mack up
I swing with the mic, and zhigge-zhigge-zhig it right
And beat you rappers down that just can't speak it right
I been a ruffneck since I was a baby, ask my mama

When I got out, it was just for bringin niggas drama
So set up the beef, I bust it down
And guarantee the opposition never see the 2nd round
And by the end of the song, you're in a trap

[Screaming in the crowd]
""Freddie Foxxx, bust a rap!""

(Rough)
(Get on the mic and get rough)

A lot of rappers try to front like they're rougher than they really are
But you're just a booty-ass nigga with a nice car
I bet the girls just like you cause they seen you on the video
You want to meet a real live nigga, here we go, hoe

First I teach you not to talk back, teach you to be loyal
Show her that my gangsta style's above royal
Teach her bout the murder game, so she'll never hate it
Then hit her with a .380 snub-nose nickel plated

See, ladies know the only thing that I like is my gun and my mic
A piece of ass, and a good fight
I'm still knockin' niggas out, ain't nothin' changed, gee
My bodyguards hold me back when there's beef

So understand the Militant Mack will never switch up
A lot of y'all talk behind my back, but in my face y'all bitch up
Yo baby boy, hold me down
While I go inside a sucker nigga's house and bust a couple of rounds

It's like the nigga in white that'll blast you in daylight
And stand there till the cops come and fight
And even if they lock me in jail, I be aight
I do a lotta push-up's, and kill a lotta mice in the night

But once they let me go 
You suckers better know 
I hit my stash
Then I'm comin for that ass

Yeah
Flippin' it on the one

(Get on the mic and get rough)

I like to cruise through Brooklyn in my old Buick Regal
And right on my left my .45 Desert Eagle
Say what's up to my boys still rappin on the corner
They want me to hang, but I'm solo, I don't want to

Check it, I knock boots like a superstar 
Girls know who they are
My name ain't Bobby Brown 
Girl, I'm humpin' around

So you see Freddie Foxxx, girl, you want to get laid
My name ain't Aaron Hall, girl, you better be afraid
I jump inside your ass like I was Johnny Meat
And do the Sweet-Dick-Willie to a fat beat

I hump you gangster style, and turn you out 
Went through all the positions that the girls love to talk about
I have you strung out, hopin' that we blow up
Waitin' for me all day, but I never show up

Because the mic is my first love, it'd never leave
I stick a mic in a rapper's ass and make him bleed
I'm Mr. Nice Lyrical Style, Freddie Foxxx, did it
Stamina Daddy, freak the funk, girl, don't forget it

So next time you see me killin on the ave., baby
With a hoodie and a .45 mag, baby
Don't play me close, cause it's beef and I'm on a mission
I'm huntin' down the fox, so baby listen

Yeah, you know the flavor, baby
And before we slide
We goin' do it on the ill, know what I'm sayin'?
One for the road, and we gon' set it off like this

How I get all the women in the palm of my hand
I told them treat her like a lady; do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
I know you've heard that the woman soon takes advantage of you

Treat her like a lady do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've got to love her, tease her, but most of all you've got to please her
You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way

I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me

What's the point in letting you get you down
You know what's going on know
You know
Then you know where you stand
You're on solid ground
No fairy tales

Expect that we grow

[Chorus]",Alright Then,2010
The Floacist,"If you feel alone is best to expose any thoughts of doubt,
You gotta air it out!
Awake, agree to know the day with the choices that you make,
Decide what you will live, decide what you will take,
Decisions, to release what you don't need
If you gotta let it be, then you have to let it be!
Be careful not to keep,
The residue of anything that had you feel weak,
Like what was said, versus what you think,
Sometimes you own assumptions of the ways that make you sink,
Feeling down,
It could be an addiction,
Getting up,
Right before the hesitation,
It takes determination,
Don't fall for the distractions,
These attractions are the target of your soul.
Asking you to stay when you know you have to go.
You know the things you know,
It's your past just your own,
Lessons will be lessened if you listen to their fear,
Hear your truth, keep it near!
And then you just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

Avoid all this confusion,
Refuse this illusion even if you destiny is not blessed.
It's your time!
No matter who came before you,
Don't let them where you're down,
The pain of your heart,
She's your own mind.
It's irrelevant,
If relevance is measured by the elements
Without bearing a, without your own kind of,
You may find that we're living in an area that can't be defined.
Like those who thought that this was the end?
Like those who thought that the enemies would win,
Like those who let paranoia tend an insight out,
You know what this life is all about.
Can you remember before anyone had taught you
To feel as if life would never gonna treat you,
Better than a lesson, but that was in a pre-course,
What about now?
You took

Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

You can do anything you want to do!
Anything that your heart truly chooses,
And may be a lonely journey but it's yours!
Is your purpose!
You may have to leave some things behind you,
You may have to change your mind
And you can't bring everybody with you,
They will be better off for having known you,
So just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,

The Floacist,"She started with a day dream
Working on a maybe
Focusing on being there
Standing in the middle

Start composing for the camera and her mind
Keep an ordered diet behind it
She's on the golden path
Everywhere that she goes

And it's only her who knows her purpose and real truth
She's not afraid that she'll lose
Cause there is no such thing
When you do something special

More or less it just feels equal
Listen to the beats and headphones
She writes everywhere she goes
On napkins and paper bags

Few verse or a rhyme
Sometimes she stays up all night
Cause her frequencies are clear
She intends to be the difference she wants to hear

She makes it clear she's not the property of commodity
Of some brother with a big chain
She's got real games not tricks
Slick and quick

Watching no one but herself
Inspired by everything
Handle no dream
She's more than a desire in everything they need

She's a queen
Walking in the light on the hill toward her horizon
Sharing she knows who she is and that's a good thing
She's prepared for the opportunity of success

She's truly blessed
And you can hear it

[Chorus]
It's the way that you rock
When you're doing your thing
It's the way that you flow
Make the people wanna sing
Go get it go get it
If it's yours
Go get it go get it
The way that you flow
Makes the people wanna sing

She tries to keep her mind fit
She works ? rhyme
She has attraction on everything
She's a magnet

Power and energy makes the enemy obey
Makes the people rock and
Music chooses her
She keeps performing

And instead of using her art platform to be a diva
The people start to see her
She gets naked in her craft
Wearing a heart and her panties

Means that she feels a piece on the stage
Like she always has things to say
The desire to heal and grow
Not claiming to know all the things

But every day she remembers
Chanel in
Like she's plugged into a source
Of course she has learned from examples

It's like her spirit is a sample of it
She writes and he wrote
So she goes where her mind shows her
Sharing what she finds

Maybe she's been doing for life time
She's in her mind and you can hear her soul
Every time you hear her flow
Listen close

What you wanna do?

You have everything and more

The Floacist,"Our love is molded from the healing depths of the darkest soil,
Overflowing amongst the golden nick time of possibilities.
From the garden of creation we crawl,
Fertile earth to abound in the seed,
Bleed of grass to ancient trees,
Shiny flower into the sweetest fruits of love.

I can’t remember how we loved before,
Before the message of our true blessings,
Before the confusion.

Masters in the mysteries of the spirit,
Now been to remember anything that thinks of truth,
It started a long time ago, so many without numbers,
No longer recognizing each other is keen
And love becomes a concept, not a necessity
Not a believer to be family.

The oral traditions have been badly overdoubted,
The spiritual language replaced by commercial tongues.
The lacking of word for heal, awakening,
Feels enlightening.
It seems that we may have forgotten our purpose.

Plant the seeds of trust deep within the heart
And let the roots of love simply be.",Roots of Love,2012

The Flying Burrito Brothers,"I was walking down the street the other day
A sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy
I must have been twice his size

His appearance typefied his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand
In my early trips to town

As he walked on beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell

So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me and he
He said ""friend you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something?
We can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other?
You see this box beneath my arm?
To you it's plain, it has no charm
But to someone dearest to my heart
This box has played a tragic part

This little one can't tell you himself
About his life and how he died
But if anyone else could speak for him,
I guess I'm qualified
This boy was in Chicago, he didn't know why he was there
He was with his family and friends and he didn't really care
You might have been one of those who saw
The struggle there on your television screen
The tragic thing is so much else happened

That no one else could have seen
A stranger handed this boy a dollar
To do a simple chore
To carry a package to a nearby hotel

And when he returned he'd get two more
But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd
One of them things you ask yourself,
How the Lord allowed

But when he was found he was like he is now,
Dreaming sweet and still
And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
Now you can take that dollar
Get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank

So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
You kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
It's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street

Just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
Now could you help us sing this song, please

There will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that way",Hippie Boy,1969
The Flying Burrito Brothers,"No affection were the words
That stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me
For the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma
Can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done
To be treated this way
In a cold dirty room
That's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine
And some pills off the shelf

Oh mamma sweet mamma
Can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done
And I'm feeling so ashamed

Then an angel appeared
She was just 17
In a dirty old gown

Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness 
Shall pass as your senses will rise
But the flowers of the city 
Thou breath like yet 
Death like thee at times
There's no use in trying 
To deal with the dying
Though I can not explain that in rhymes

Your cracked country lips 
I still wish to kiss
Have to be by the touch of your skin
Your magnetic movements 
Still capture the moments I'm in
It grieves my heart, love 
To see you trying 
To be a part of a world 
That just don't exist
It's all just a scheme, babe 
A vacuum of dreams 
That sucks you into 
Feeling like this

I've heard you say many times 
That your better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that 
You know you have nothing to win 
And nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends 
Your sorrow does stem
They'll hype you and type 
A make you feel 
That you got to be just like them

I'd forever talk to you 
But soon my words would turn 
Into a meaningless ring  
For deep in my heart 
There's no help I can bring
Everything passes everything changes 
Just do what you think you should do
Then someday maybe 
Who knows, baby 
I'll come and be crying to you",To Ramona,1971

I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
Cause she is moving somewhere far away  not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go
Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities it's not the first break I've had                 
And I just can't let it bring me down too low
And though I tried so hard to please her

It seemed  that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine

The Flying Burrito Brothers,"Well, I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee

I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well, her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth
Is Baltimore at night

Well, a man feels proud
To give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene

And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well, I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me

Now I'm a-going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The oak tree where you carved my name
A year ago now
Somehow doesn't really look the same

I think it closed now
The places we would go
Still play the songs we used to know

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The cottage where we used to meet
Is overgrown now
We dreamed we'd live there too someday

Just on our own now
The letters you wrote me
Still bring that sentimental ring

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,

I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care

Better start in to forget you

Were you a bee, there would be sweeter honey, 
Were you a tune everyone would be croonin' 
Harmonizin' out in the street! 
You're such a bundle of me oh my, 
And that's the reason when you go by, 
Each heart naturally skips a beat!

And I love you 'cause I know you 
Are such a sweetheart 
That when you walk down the street, 
Everyone's heart, just naturally skips a beat!

Better start in to forget you 
Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you love me! 

Were you the sun, it would be twice as sunny, 
Were you a bee, there would be sweeter honey, 
Were you a tune everyone would be croonin' 
Harmonizin' out in the street! 
You're such a bundle of me oh my, 
And that's the reason when you go by, 
Each heart naturally skips a beat!

Who have met you

I would go there on my honeymoon,
If you were my girl . . .

It would be a storybook affair,
If you were my girl . . .
If you'd like some ice cream,
From the milky way,
I would shinny up the moonbeam,
An' bring you a rainbow parfait . . .
Just a sailin' along,
On the wings of a song,
With you by my side,
Life would be a rolly coaster ride,
If you were my girl . . .
If you were my girl . . .
If you were my girl . . .

The Fontane Sisters,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Everywhere you go,
Take a look in the Five & Ten,
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in every store,
But the purdy-est sight to see,
Is the holly that will be on your own front door!

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots,
Is the wish of Barney and Ben,
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk,
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring,
Is the carol that you sing,
Right within your heart!

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

[Ghostface]
Yo, yo these streets got me backed down how can I escape?
How can I survive without bubbling weight?
It's prepared for the stand off, once you hand off
that white rock, and then give birth to a knot
Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam
You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens
But at the same time, niggas on the block is ill
Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills
Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway
Brothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared
Back in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here
It's time to motor, travel like a foul order

Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great big ol' sky

[Ghostface]
Sink deep into the fog, big buffalo large
Taj Mahal just got banged, shanked for eighty dollars
It's hard to keep up, with these key-ons, that smoke dust
In the U.S. Mint they want to rock the place and call the rush
All these shameless niggas armed with cherry-red Bally's
On the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is getting married
Killed for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina
Vaseline lips is cracked cause they all had dreams
They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru
Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo
Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on
A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch em get they feast on
Royal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven
Curse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven)

Late for the man choose and hit socks and stereos
The kid's nice, warning you twice, run your garments
Jet to Providence, switch up and back down your Parliament
Ironman is laced with a plate inside the dome piece
Go off in airports, biographies, prophecies
Watch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert
And walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic
Carbon copy, I love my car, it's near choppy
Malachi off the funky pain with the wax poppy on instrumentals
Niggas get lost like S.S. Minnows
Turned out like rentals, keep gold around the denim

The Forecast,"It's in these letters that we write
To our friends and family
Spilling secrets of our past
A brief history
Packed with pills, alcohol
And cuts that'll run so deep

So we must stand up
For the ones we love
And give them hope
Before they fall down

So they say, I've lost and I've found
And I've found no way out
Of this mess that we have made
So let me get this straight
You want out
Or just to leave town

So we must stand up
For the ones we love
And give them hope
Before they fall

And give them hope
Before they fall down

For new beginnings with better endings
Long nights for the sleep deprived
Friends fading while falling in love

I'll write these letters to you
From a desk in a room that's bleeding truth
And I won't sleep so I'll have
No regrets to waste on you

We'll fight the good fight, the good fight

I've waited so long to hear
Goodnight until sunrise

We'll fight the good fight, the good fight
Waiting up for the phone to ring off the hook
I've waited so long to hear
Goodnight until sunrise

Let's drink to our fallen friends
To our failures and our futures
Wasted, on the ride home
Fight the feeling, we're not alone

I got this feeling I can't shake tonight
So I'll call you for the hundredth time
Just asking for a reply

We'll fight the good fight, the good fight

The Forecast,"Spending nights trying to find out why kids are dying

With our friends before they fade out
",Losing Signal,2005

Lay my fears and my failures
To rest, no more dreams

You'll lie awake waiting for your moment
To shine, precious time
(You can't waste)

Just waiting weighed down by the fears
Of our fathers can't stop us now
Because waking up with the road
Moving under our feet is what moves us

You're moving out you'll trade your six string
For a family and a desk and I don't blame you for giving up

But I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about

We're cutting teeth on dreams of excess
With rolled up sleeves we're bound to push on

I want you to feel me baby
I want you to understand me baby
This is it yo, no bullshit
No jokes, no games
This is it yo, fo real
I see it happenin' man
It's about to go down
For all of us (fo real)
I see you swinging, I see you noddin' to it
It's about to go down for us, word up man
We almost home
We almost at the finish line nigga
It feel good, don't it? Oh!
And it's ova!
I can go home and chill
(Feel it, yo)

[Verse 1]
It's a long process from bar 1 to bar 16 and
Writin in my notebook from morn' to evenin
But my fam still not believin' - in my bed late
At night with my eyes closed often dreamin'
And zoned out I'm goin' out fuck it I'm home now
Arrestin' the rhythm I'm a rolling stone now
Making my own way from stone cold days and long nights
But who could feel my sacrifice
Cause they ain't half as nice and couldnt' understand
How I feel when I'm on the track board turnin the knob switch
Moms keep talking that old ""get a real job"" shit
And that's the kind of thinking Phonte got a prob with
Solved it - my blood fam on the bandwagon
Can't believe the man put his plan into action
They rather that I choose a different plan for my passion
Couldn't understand I demand satisfaction

They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy
? baby

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's a new day it's time to see
I got a seed, Amaya, the love of my life
Best believe, plus I still got love for me
I'm doin this for her and me, take mics and make currency
Steady worryin' yo, I wish I had a clone of me
Man this ain't the way it supposed to be
My daughter's mom wishin she was close to me
Holdin' me, instead she's lonely - and loathing
Complaining that her life's competin' with mine
Cause I be out of the house for weeks at a time
And she be stuck at home playing housewifey with an attitude
Before we had a kid, we should've had a clue
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
Repetitively, life seems to grip me
I'm trying to be a better man, please believe me
Ready and god willin if you ready to teach me

[Verse 3]
Everybody gotta way to try to be the man
Some write rhymes others move kilograms
You ain't tryna play yourself with me neither man
Because I was dealt I can play 'em with either hand (c'mon)
I gotta be the plan, put it in motion
A nigga on the grind I'm proceedin with focus
I know that makin my moves ain't a part of your plans
But understand that that ain't all that I am
I was lost in the ?
Got a call from a man with a studio he bought with a grand
Feel like destiny was in the palm of his hand
Real shit we can all understand (check it out yo)

Aiyyo I be the rap golden child
That's old school like Heinekens and lowering brows
Used to get bent but I'm sober now
and these days that's how I hold it down
Look over crowds like a fatal attack
Overdose style, I'm stopping niggas dead in they tracks
Before they even start a beef to get it settled on wax
You better email or send in a fax, don't make the most of it
You talking loud just cause the hoes love it
I treat beef like otiose and y'all ain't tryna go public
or go at it, supposedly mad at me
Tripping with name brand emotional baggage
It's big time, the ride don't be approaching the average
I'm roasting you faggots cause I'm so diplomatic
and that's just the way we doing it y'all

Cause I ain't got no fuck around time
like Cesar, yo I woke up from a dream today
Thinking bout how I'm gon' get some fuckin' cream today
So many emcees to crush and teams to slay
So many rhymes to write, so many things to say
And yo we still ain't willies or thugs, can't concede new thoughts
Hip Hop needs some infertility drugs
Cause this rap shit supposed to be art
Niggas tryna eat but everybody got a grocery cart
Rap should be beautiful like raindrops or walks in the park
A child's first steps or even playing roles in the dark
I'm parallel to the culture just composing my thoughts
Coming back to the music we supposedly lost
Get some Gs one day and we can hopefully floss
Get together for real, together for real

'Cause I ain't got no fuck around time
I spend my moments in the lab putting down rhymes
and if you ain't fam, get the fuck from around mine
I'm making sure my cards are dealt right
Sound bomb but stealth mics, and when it's on stage it's hell tight
and give a fuck what you felt like
Cause it ain't given till I say it is
Nigga, stop tryna help Ike
and get the fuck out my spotlight with all your spitting
This year we getting that turkey with all the trimmings
On tour with all the womens, looking like we pushing more weight
than Richard Simmons with chicks from more religions

Even though my roommate have me mad as fuck
Nigga be acting crackish, fucking up my money hustling backwards
Financially I took some hard blows
But shit I also rocked some hard shows
Niggas came to check us out by the carloads
Screaming my name like I scanned a million barcodes already
My squad flows till we all sweaty
We struggling to pay our bills so we really can't ball heavy
And God knows I be calling on him
Cause I be writing mad cheques that might as well have Spalding on 'em
The shoulders of my team, I be falling on 'em
Providing support that help the pain go away

Going to class, dozing off, waking up, never learning the lessons

Struggles pass and I go about life without half the stressing
I know who got my back, no need for raising the question
Cause when times get hard, it's to my brothers I call
Taking the weight, no matter large or small
I smile everyday, thanks to y'all, we gonna eat for real
Ease the mind so we can sleep for real
It took longer than we wished but the blow meant I knew we could
Find the best way to live life, it's so right

The Foreign Exchange,"Spokesman of the precious few
I represent the views of independent youth
that wrestle nail and tooth to evade neckties and suits
Cause truthfully a nine-to-nine's a waste of time
Plus a waste of mind, so I blaze a dime
Tryna find creative ways to escape the grind
I gotta take what's mine in this land of milk and honey
filled with money, still hungry and won't finish
till I fill my tummy, grill me or love me
My passion is unbridled, when idol crafted recitals
They can't lose like Magic or Michael, pick or choose
Not only dropping knowledge but slamming and dishing jewels
Navigate with slicker moves, through the gritty city I cruise
Confused what to do with my life, but got my sights set on the apex
It's a safe bet that I ain't taking no for an answer
This quest for dough is like a cancer
Spreading over body parts, especially my mind and heart
Time to start the relentless pursuit so I can make my mark
on this planet, granted I meant it, see-saw mechanics
from circumstances that only causing confidence damage
Planet firmly I'm standing on the outskirts of the average
Relishing the challenger till the day my spirit vanish
Man this life is tough and I've had enough, my tank's on empty
Valleys are plenty, but from the top they can't prevent me
The rotten apple, it tempts me, locked in the grapple at Lensy
Time to take stock and watch how far determined they should get me

Everybody across the world better get your hustle on
Out in the street, move your feet before your money's gone

I gotta make my moves so I got some
Mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
I gotta make my moves so I got some
Yeah, yeah

Stress should hear me, never any rest for the weary
Try to progress, at best I eat, sleep barely
The future is scary and so I proceed to look for solid ground
But difficult because I'm always in and out of town
Weigh by the pound, not in a duffle
I bear a bigger burden on my back that go beyond the strength of muscle
The hustle and bustle, trying to figure out the puzzle
of how to triumph amongst the troubles sent to bust your bubble
Trust I'm accustomed with the everyday
I wonder will my stress will ever decay, looking for a better way
Ahead of the days of a bigger mission, sealing my vision
C.A.L.I.B.E.R. living and bringing it to fruition
Lord if you listen, I'm only asking for the strength
to bask in the paper after laboring for such length
It's like an eternity with much ahead
I hope of every second I invested, I'm collecting at the end

Told 'em, that I was sorry for the way that I lived

Cause then she?ll keep me
In the safety of her arms
She never leaves me

And when the sun rises, she watches over me

He tells me all his secrets
He thinks nobody knows
We lay together in daylight
I love him so

And when the sun rises, he watches over me

It?s not like it was before
And she can?t keep me anymore
She loves me?

It's too expensive and it takes up space
Aaaa... who needs it? 

Art is never understood
Especially when it's good
It gives us chills 

Art speaks to us from each distant land
Reminding us of our telephone bills 

Art is noble and refined
The loftiest endeavor of the human mind
So paint a picture of my fat behind
Aaaa... who needs it? 

Art is ""Phantom"" and ""Les Miz""
I don't know much about it but I know what it is
It ain't a crucifix submerged in whiz
Aaaa... who needs it? 

Art is never what it seems
It drives us to extremes
It makes us think 

Art shows how lovely are lives can be
Reminding us that our real lives stink 

Art is ageless and sublime
A waste of otherwise productive time
It leads to Yoga, Hacky Sack and Mime
Who needs it? Who needs it? Who needs it? Who needs it? 

Who needs Art?
Who needs Art?
Who needs Art?
When you're renewing American civilization 

Art is lewd and Art is vile — 

Wait! I'd like to say a word in Art's defense
Art doesn't make a lot of sense
And so it's easy to ignore 

And, furthermore
It helps us forget about money and war
It helps us remember what we're living for...


Right! Money and war!


Artists are vain, corrupt and fat
They spend our taxes ""finishing the hat"" 

They paint us pretty pictures... 

Well, we've got politicians to do that
Who needs it, who needs it, who needs it, who needs it? 

Who needs Art?
Who needs Art?
Who needs Art?

When they gathered round and started talking,

Lord knows to my surprise:

Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.

No matter how hard I tried,
When he started sweet talking to me,
he'd come tell me everything is alright,
he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright,
Can I get away again tonight?.

Stealing kisses from me on the sly,
Taking time to make time,
Telling me that he's all mine,

Looking to see how much we'd grown.

The Forester Sisters,"All you wanted was a one night stand
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man
But I fell in love and ruined all of your plans
What'll you do about me
Imagine the faces on your high class friends
When I beat on the door and I beg to come in
Screamin' ""come on love me again""
What'll you do about me

You can change your number you can change your name
You can ride like hell on a midnight train
That's alright mama, that's o.k.
But what'll you do about me

Picture your neighbors when you try to explain
That good ol' boy standin' out in the rain
With his nose on the window pane
Lady, what'll you do about me
What in the world are you plannin' to do
When a man comes over just to visit with you
And I'm on the porch with a 2'X2'
Tell me what'll you do about me

You can call your lawyer you can call the fuzz
You can sound the alarm - wake the neighbors up
Ain't no way to stop a man in love
What'll you do about me

All you wanted was a one night stand
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man
But I fell in love and baby here I am
What'll you do about me
You can change your number you can change your name
You can ride like hell on a midnight train
That's alright mama, that's o.k.
But what'll you do about me",What'll You Do About Me,1992
The Forester Sisters,"I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams",I'll Be Home for Christmas,1993
The Forester Sisters,"Nothing grows in the driest places, 
the bitter cold, 
or children's faces, 
like love will, 
love will... 

Nothing can be everlasting 
or send an iron curtain crashing

Select your carrier... 
  

like love will, 
love will... 

Loves a gift the richest or the poorest man can give. 

Its the only treasure that I know. 

Love will not forsake you on the last day that you live 'cause you can take it with you when you go. 

You can do the world a favor, 
love yourself and love your neighbor 
if you will, 
love will. 

Someone leaves and we've all been through it, tears don't help and words won't do it 
but love will, 
love will... 

I don't want to be there if we all wake up to late... love's the only weapon that is strong enough for hate. 

You can do the world a favor, 
love yourself and love your neighbor if you will, 
oh, if you will, love will, love will, 
ooo love will, love will, love will.",Love Will,1993
