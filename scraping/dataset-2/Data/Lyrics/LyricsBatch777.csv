Geschichten die das Leben mir schreibt
Alles was mich fordert und lenkt
Wurde mir vom Himmel geschenkt

Ich hab Beats fett wie Jabba the Hutt, schreibe einen Reim und pack ihn in Takt
Ändere das Wetter wie Storm, bin zum Rapper geboren
Spitz mal besser die Ohren, denn keiner hier kann besser performen
Seh wie mein Homie Obi-Wan Kenobi gerade Koks zieht
Ich sage was is los mit dir, da is gegen die Vorschrift

Plötzlich kommt Yoda und sagt „oha, hast du noch Koks da?“
Obi-wan sagt „oh ja, aber nicht soviel wie Conan oder Thor da“
Und Magneto hat ein Kilo feinstes Coca aus Mordor
Was für'n Horror, alle meine Superhelden sind Kokser (oh nein)
Plötzlich kommt Harry Potter, sagt, dass er Pott hat
Und mach dich mal locker, Samy, check mal lieber dieses Odd ab aus Hogwarts

Feier mich gerade auf down south hardcore Rap
Mit dem Terminator weg
Plötzlich klingelts an der Tür und es ist Dagobert Duck mit dem Punisher
Sagt: „Samy, schön dich zu sehen, es ist so lange her“
Ich sag: „Nein, du warst gerade gestern hier und vorgestern hier
Denn du bist zu geizig selber Geld zu investieren
Willst nur Gras schnorren, bist nur 'n Arschloch
Jeder kifft hier am Block, geh doch zu Spongebob“
Er sagt: „Nein, denn der hat das Thaiweed aus Bangkok
Und hört Punkrock, Funk, Pop oder Truckstop
Außerdem ist Willi da, hier ist viel chilliger
Ich chill lieber mit dir, denn du rauchst wie 'ne Dampflok“
Ding dong, kann es sein, dass ich schon wieder 'ne Klingel hör?
Ich bin empört, wer ist das zur Hölle? Das sind die Ninja Turtles
Und die Panzerknacker und sagen „Was geht ab, Motherfucker?
Wir hörten hier steigt 'ne Party oder was geht ab? Ha?“
Ich denk wahrscheinlich soll's so sein, ich lad sie auf ein paar Holsten ein
Auf einmal rollt Professor X in seinem Rollstuhl rein
Und ich denk „Wow, wer ist diese Frau? Jean Grey!“
Normalerweise bin ich ein Teamplayer, aber öh jetzt gerade nicht
Sage ich dem DJ, ich will jetzt mit Jean Grey Tango tanzen
Doch sie will mit Rambo tanzen (was?)
Spiel ein bisschen Enrique Iglesias
Ich hab hier ein paar Platten von ebay

Auf einmal kommt Iron Man, sagt: „Lass uns feiern, Sam
Komm wir gründen eine Band, wir nennen sie Iron Man
Featuring Samy Deluxe“
Ich sag: „Nein, wir nennen sie Lieber Samy Deluxe featuring Iron Man“
Roger Rabbit sagt, ihr habt schon einen Fan
Captain America sagt, dass er gerne den Nightliner fährt
Freddy Kruger sagt, dass er gerne Merchandiser wär'
Ich sage: „Das wird leider schwer“

Kommen langsam, aber sicher zum Abschluss
Und ich wollte euch noch eine Nummer zeigen
Die einfach so bisher unveröffentlicht rumliegt
Nena und ich ha'm bisschen Musik gemacht die letzten Jahre
Für ihr Album, ma' für mein Album
Und es gibt aber auch so 'n paar Songs
Von denen wir noch nicht genau wissen was wir damit machen
Aber eine hat's jetzt in dieses unplugged Set geschafft
So 'n bisschen so'n Resumé über zwanzig Jahre im Tourbus rumfahren

A veces le echo de menos si tú no estás, a veces tengo que hacer de tripas corazón. A veces tengo que huir, porque no puedo más.

Ve nomas tan bella como siempre

Y al igual me da gusto mirarte

No nos importo la gente disfrutamos el momento

No es instantánea, no se escribe en un día

Y es real que tus ojos narren que me amas

Tu estas cerca el corazón redacta todo lo que sientes
No es ficción que tus manos acaricien el alma y que 
Tu cuerpo cumpla mis deseos y como en los cuentos 
Me despiertes siempre dándome un beso de amor verdadero 

Me miraste, llegaste y te quedaste 
El papel de príncipe tomaste y superaste al de color azul

When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind

Said to me ""I'm your sweet buttercup"" 
You're lying, you're lying, begging him to stay and crying
You're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied

[Chorus:]
Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right

You took my man and didn't mean it
But you did it to hurt my feelings
What I should do is slap you in your face
You left me here with a pain below my waste

You lose a guy you move into the larder
You got no style, why don't you try a little harder
Chocolates, bananas, doughnuts and salami
Ain't gonna fit cause you're full of bologna

[Chorus]

Only back alley rats take other people's cats
And then strike back, that isn't where I'm at

Anyway, it's gonna get you anyway
Anyday, I'm gonna get you, get you

[Chorus]

I thought you were my friend
God, you're so digital girl
You're like one of those cabbage patch creatures

You burn the candle at both ends
You're gonna feel the heat
If everything you do comes back to you
By now you'd be dead meat
You took my man and took his body strapped him to your bed just to have his baby
Everybody knows you're a phoney
You just want his alimoney

I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run,
On the last stretch, on the last stretch.
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run,
On the left foot, with the right foot.

[Chorus]

You could have reached for me, saved me from lying and I wanted to touch you.
But I was stuck on my island,
With a puddle of misunderstanding like a sea between us.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.

[Chorus]

Come rain, come shine, I'm leaving this love ghetto.
Come rain, come shine, I'm leaving this love ghetto.

Chasing you is haunting me, but I know that girl is lying.
You upset my chemistry.
Baby I'm sick of crying,
Forever is only like the sky and the sea between us.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.

Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto.
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto.
I can't see a way everyday we are the same
Turning 'round and 'round I pick you up and then you let me down
Never will I blame, never will I hate
I'll just have to go saving you from saving me.

Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream
Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild? 
Is it the pain of the drinking
Or the Sunday sinking feeling
The car never seems to work
When it's late your girlfriend's on a date
And the hero with her in your dream
In your sleep it seemed to like you
Turn around and ask yourself
Turn around ask yourself 

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in 
Could you go undercover
And sell your brand new lover (could you)
Be someone else for a night
Maybe someone else will love you
You sell your soul for a tacky song
Like the one you hear on the radio
Turn around ask yourself
Turn around and ask yourself 

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, Manchild, Manchild 

From Monday down to Friday
You're working on another man's car
Or is it in the factory?
It doesn't matter where you are 
Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication
Accentuate the positive and give some illustration
See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on
To the point that I need, the air that I breathe
Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive-
For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it
I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it
Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses.
Enough R-E-S-P-E and C-T
Respect yourself express no stress the mike is easy
Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe. 
Turn around ask yourself 

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, Manchild, Manchild

He's the apple of your eye 
Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again
Just take it in the right and go tell your friend
Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on
A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on
The style I'm stimulating dance floors
Raise your body temperature now and

In a green dress I felt lost
The first time I went to school
I was 4 feet 2, 6 feet scared and so distressed
This dress was green, I was the best dressed
I'd ever been, first day at school
I said teacher teacher I know my ABC's
I want to read and write, I want to understand
Why the sky never ends and why the sky is blue
And not white - right
But when I spoke my heart broke
'Cause it was plain to see that school
Would never be the picture for my fantasy

I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come
I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come

Slowly I came to discover
Time, heals, time feels so young
When you're having fun
At 13 my kiss was sweet and not deep
Covered in blush kiss 'n tell
My lips were deep red and shiny as hell
In my stairwell kiss ""n"" love discovered me
Undercover my fantasy my first kiss hit and miss
He wasn't impressed 'cause I wouldn't get undressed
Wrote my name on the wall - my hair was pressed
He had blue balls

If you want to rock you've got to roll it
If you gonna live you've got to show it
And if you're gonna do it, you got to do it right - don't you know it

So here I come, so here I come

And through the windows behind the screens
In the red light after a fight love was made

Neneh Cherry,"Into a world I plunge through my headphones
Escape into the streetlight
I begin to believe in destiny
When my surroundings in rhythm with me
I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people
I look around me and my name is just someone
For a moment in time I belong
Where my heart beats the fear is gone
Like destiny

[Chorus]
So move with me I'm strong enough
To be weak in your arms
Move with me I'm strong enough
To be real in your arms

Whispering as I was driving
Quietly the car was rolling
Like a bullet
I was feeling the speed moving
Me faster. Addicted to the rhythm
On my ghetto blaster
That's me supposing
That the clarity of thought
Is clear enough to think
It's real enough to touch
The wind on me got me tripping
Can I keep you next to me
Till the end of the world

[Chorus]

Like the joker on the pile
Never coming or going
The color of my true cards was showing
Keeping in touch with an idea
That I been growing
Trust trust I must trust
With my head on my chest
I rest with the rest of the restless

Neneh Cherry,"I'm just another voice from the street,
And since it's my choice, I feel that I must speak.
Now I know that you won't listen to little me,
But I can't rest unless I get this off my chest.
See the city's my home, the streets where I roam,
But still I leave the drugs and violence alone.

And so I try to stay in the right frame of mind,
Although I know some people who might say that I'm
Crazy and lazy for not breakin' out,
But the city has soul and that's what I'm about.

I have an appetite that must be fed,
No longer blind and being led.
The type of freedom that you can buy,
My bank won't lend me yet.
But still I can get by, and even smile.
So don't judge me by the colour of my skin;
My blood runs as deep as your runs red,
Which takes me out of the rap.

[Chorus]
The choice is mine,
With my joy and pain inside,
And I ain't gone under yet!

See bodies with souls living in the street.
No one wants to live with nothing to eat,
But to climb over living people and feel 
That they brought it on themselves 'cause 
They lazy or would rather steal is a mystery.

So don't judge me by the colour of my skin;
My blood runs as deep as your runs red,
Which takes me out of the verse.

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,

I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

I don't steal, I don't run tricks or scams,
'Cause I'm a strong young woman; yes I know who I am.
But sometimes it's so hard to get by,

And the friend is gone who put a hole
In you.

And I left taking a part of you.
Like red, red paint on the sole
Of my shoe, nothing to do with
Common sense or...

Sensitivity. I'm feeling cold
Like concrete.
Your dignity's reflecting
In the way I feel it.

Open minded.  The thoughts are clear
From feeling, regardless.

You were oh so happy just the other day;
Now heartbeats with pain took it all away.

Looking out from the inside,
While life turns to blue.

Leave their red, red footprints
On our...

Neneh Cherry,"""I'll have to tell everybody about-about-about myself""

From the same dirt from the heels of my ancestors
The naked roads and the fields where the pain festered
I wonder where the hold came from
In the deeps of my heart make me yearn for the drum
It's the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
It's the place where the floss was yearned
Gold teeth and bling ice on the rings baby, sure

We've all got things that hang at the back
Things that make us cool
Things that make us whack
Things that make us mad
Things we wish we never had done
But they're just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids our hair
Until we all get there

I like that I don't know some mysteries
Ancient things and beginnings
Excited about the day when I don't have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease
In the same place where the crosses burned
The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these braids with the twist and turns so

We've all got things that hang at the back

The road twists and braids our hair
Until we all get there

Walking in the race of life
Looking for my own pace
Not always wanting to but I have to
Sometimes feeling like I've bitten off much more than I can chew
But the wind goes through my hair
And lifts me up with ease, not a crease
Hair full of grease no weave embracing me
It's you I see
I am you and you are me I see, yeah
I am you and you are me I see, yeah

Inna city love, you crushed me into a pulp - I trusted you

When I loved you from a distance
And your skyline made me a promise
In my safe world to be somebody
In your city to own your streets
Where I'd strut covered in money
Shattered dreams. it ain't funny

Now I look at you with tears in my eyes
The good the bad the ugly
As I start to cry I search for the sky
Taste the breeze and watch a block of docking clouds, they're coming.

You bore another child to be victim of
Your cold blooded ways
Inna city love
From the gutter
So destructive when you sing your blues

I want to love you baby
I don't mean maybe baby, but I need everything you got

You can't break your promise
I'm inna city hunger, you think you're tough I'm stronger
If you're weak I'll eat you up
I'm gonna touch you where you've never been touched before
And by your spine I'll bruise your veins and touch your very core
Let my concrete be your red carpet
My shooting galleries your personal starship
Give me all your dreams, this city loves you

Use my roots to deliver your body
Under my skies where you make your money
You rejected love, but this city loves you

I have always been too loud
Won't you help me drown it out
I'm what I feel, what I'm feeling is surreal
I'm a mass of spinning wheels
Always digging in my heels

Neneh Cherry,"Love forsaken, risk worth taking
Spearmint flavors, all my palate shudders
I’m a member of shattered illusions
And am I needless to say?
Another song, this is nothing new

But love is big in every man
Every nation seeks its friends in France and Italy
And all across the seven seas
And Goddamn guns and guts and history
And bitter love still put a hole in me

Bite my head off, still my world will always be
A little risk worth taking
Bite my hand off, still my world will always be
Another risk worth taking

Gotta step out a limb, swallow my pride
Surrender, not give myself away
Little measures all the time
Become part of you, nothing new
Still half-full for absolutions
In my day there’s no solutions

And love is big in every land
Every nation seeks its friends in France and Italy
And all across the seven seas
And Goddamn guns and guts and history
And bitter love still put a put a hole in me

Bite my head off, still my world will always be
A little risk worth taking
Bite my hand off, still my world will always be
Another risk worth taking",Kong,2018

Broke some glass, broken politics
Try to bring it on

Se pone bien demoniaca si nos ven cantando paca junto a Daddy
Todo el mundo pal' party, vamo' a romper la disco
Gata que pille en mi zona rebuliando la compito

Siempre activo no me gustan los bolico
Un flow más puro que el perico de Kali
Ya no me cabe un sello mas en el pasaporte
Tratar de hacer dinero pa' mi es un deporte
Sin corte, le damos duro al que se ponga torpe
Fuletazo pa' acá, martillazo y golpe
Y estamos duros no jugamos
Nos damos par de miles mientras vacilamos
Muy fuerte socio, sin ir al gym
Repartiendo reggaeton de Puerto Rico a Begín
Que estoy mal, socio usted esta mal informado
Tu no ves la ostia que yo ando
Tu no ves la pendeja que me estoy desplazando

Me meto cuatro pepas pa' romper la discoteca
Yo busco una Lobita con el cuerpo de Atleta
Y como bailas tu así es que me calienta
Pues son sus besos que me saben a Menta
Ando con la real ""El Mago"" por si inventan
Con Kendo Kaponi, Gringo y mi punto 40
Los mato con el cangri el dueño de la Imprenta
Somos los durakos así que paganos la renta
Hemos aprendido a jugar con fuego
Quieren fuego, fuego, fuego caliente les metemos
Sientan la intensidad pa' enviarlos hasta el cielo
Les metemos, le hacemos canto los cesos

Mucho mucho Rosé, 30 botellas
Una onza de kush me la fumo completa

Shorty mano arriba le gusta mi flow de ronco
Quiere más swing tranquila yo se lo pongo
Yo si la perreo, pa' que sienta el tronco
Y me hago el loco, pitcher como Randy Johnson
Un piquete fuerte, homie what you think?
Me creo Will Smith, me dicen el Fresh Prince
Pero se confunde, y te meto el clip
Y cuando ves el flash de la cámara click
El capitán del equipo, young Derek Jeter
Queda con la tolta Alex Rodríguez
A mi no me tocan, me voy por encima

Ya lo saben pa' cuando la vean la identifiquen
A ver si son bravos y me derriten

Y yo estoy tan cabrón que de meterme a la cabina 
El Micro y el Protools se trancan
Ella me dice demonio dame duro en la pista
Pa virarme los ojos como el exorcista
Dale rico y con odio, bájala mas lento
Yo llego a la disco me paro en la esquina
Y parece que estoy en el centro
El del momento, tu gato ha visto con cuantos yo entro
Bien fácil que seria mañana sacarlo por noticiero

Se tiran de espalda y se les ven las nalgas 
Entonces dicen que uno es un bellaco y no respeta (seguro) 
Puñeta, pues a la calle asi no salgas (puta!)

Están al tope, por que lo que consumen no lo rechazan
Desenmoño el topo e' menta, en billetes de 50
Y tu comprando 31 que no cocina en la lenta
Yo sé que les da depre saber to' lo que facturo
Porque viven del menudo, es que mi pauta esta en Neptuno
Te caes si tu me miras, o molestar en la calma china
O tener mira bajaron las F negras en campanilla
Compramos los mil kit de 100 que son pa' las glopetas
Si aprietan van a correr tu y tu mujer en chancletas
A la milla, aquí van de raja pa' la silla
Tengo el money, como dicen los Domi eso a ti te quilla'

Ñengo Flow,"Los Vaqueros, luchando por esto que llamamos vida
Vivimos día a día con mucha gallardía
Y demostrando siempre la hombría
Ser un vaquero no es coger un arma y sentirte más que nadie
Un vaquero respeta para que lo respeten,
No importando el ni el tamaño ni el corillo con que se encuentre el otro
Un vaquero siempre mantendrá la cabeza en alto
Porque esta claro en su andar
Muchos por ahí vociferan que son vaqueros y que son esto y lo otro
Pero mira mejor aprenda de los que saben de esto
Déjese llevar por los que le dan consejos para bien
Y no de aquellos que ponen un arma en sus manos para que le tire a un hermano
No sea un monigote, demostremos la inteligencia de defender la razón
Recuerden que cuando la verdad llega, la mentira baja la cabeza
Hago un llamado a que se respete a la familia,
A que no se le esté tirando a esos carros,
Que las mujeres o niños van monta'o
A nadie le gustaría pasar por eso
Para ser un vaquero te hace falta corazón
Para decir las cosas tal cual y siempre cumplir con tu palabra
Y éste que les voy a presentar es el líder de los vaqueros
Wisin, te habla tu amigo Gavilan
Despertando conciencia en los vaqueros
Doble U que dejen la nebula
Que saben que les tenemos el ojo clavao

¡doble U! Okay, los vaqueros llegamos, ustedes toditos temblaron
Hablaron, roncaron pero nunca me pararon, cambiaron
Quisieron medir fuerzas conmigo y se estrellaron
Hice un llamado y los duros del género se reportaron
En verdad los don ustedes no aguantan mi presión
No me hables de dinero ni de proyección
Movimientos millonarios de nación a nación,
Los que conocen la operación los vaqueros de expedición
De inmediato, liricamente esto es un maltrato
Y estaba pa rato seguimos en el liderato,
Ustedes huelen a envidia me lo dice el olfato
Midiendo fuerzas pelagatos yo tengo los campeonatos

La marash
Del aeropuerto al concierto tengo todo self
Cierro todo allí luego regreso al jet
Prendo un blon en el aire que el piloto dice oh shit
Y al bajarme del avión me monté en un corvette
Ando fuera de control parezco una epidemia
Tengo tanto Flow que puedo abrir una academia
Y enseñarte a vestir y enseñarte a rapiar
Todo me queda bien aunque en verdad me quede mal
Cuidado con lo que hablan o vayan a hablar
Hasta a Pablo lo mataron, aquí nadie es inmortal (Escobar)
Los rifles del pana mío están locos por disparar
Y si te dan, no te salvan en el hospital
Prrrra
Causan heridas difícil de ver,
Profundo ni un sastre te puede coser
Mala mía es que ya los mató sin querer
Pero si no los mato como mi familia va a comer

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh)
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Saliendo pa fuera, Jordan en piel de pantera
Dicen Cosculluela a veces exagera
Intachable, nunca me han declarado culpable
Y bajar al nivel de ustedes ya no es negociable
Marica, los oyeron lo certifican
Diamantes en mi Rolex ya parecen canicas
Es inmenso el motor en el Ferrari menso
Tu no me vas a alcanzar en un Mercedes Benz
El piquete, el águila tras el billete
En sociedad con el tirao negro del doblete
Rapero estás escuchando el verdadero,
Cosculluela comandando Los Vaqueros

Ajustame el audífono que esto es pa los vaqueros
Si hay que romper el micrófono
Leyendo lo que escribo en la nota de mi telefono
Ya soy un icono, apuntandoles el rostro como blancos de polígonos
'Toy pensando que yo vengo en la fe del piloto
Lambe escroto de ese rostro te vo a sacar el poroto
Ay ma, que el lugar teniente cambien el sendero
La sociedad del dinero y yo matando en los vaqueros
Siente el rantantan fue que volvió el animal dale siguelo
Con los de Guayaquil te la vo a busca
Ya yo estoy aquí no me voy a salir
Quien me va a sacar si como yo no hay
Así que no lo intentes
Porque quedarás con daños permanentes

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo
Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Andan vociferando de que pistolean
Que me darán muerte donde yo me vea
Quisiera ver tu cara cuando me meta tu aldea
Y le limpie la cacharra al frente tuyo al más que mea
Dímelo Wisin llegaron los vaqueros del futurum
Fue casi de seguro brincaran como canguro
Pendejo operaciones millonarias decisiones
Un quimico fresco pa hacer temblar las naciones
Bajando al enemigo del caballo a lo Billy The Kid
Un solo fantasmeo y doble U no salen de aquí
Fuego pa ti te va a caer cuando me activar
Los vaqueros tienen calibre y rompen al que se la vive

Yo los he visto como ladran, como se crecen en un par de meses
Pero cuando explota el peo, se desaparecen
Vociferan que son líder, roncan que son los killer
Se meten un par de pepas y los pasos no los miden
El miedo les falla el pulso, hacer calle ya no hay pulso
Vaqueros tamo aquí so que controlen los impulsos
Y los requisitos son hay que tener cojones,
No hablar mierda en las canciones, 'tar ready pa las misiones
Y se monta too el mundo, se respeta al que respete
Yo estoy en la calle desde que pito tenia grillete
Yo te la traigo como eco eco seo pa que llegue
Si no te mando a los dementes pa que de una te frenen
Dile Wisin que yo si que soy real,
Que yo no fantasmeo, que yo si soy un anormal
En moto seca a trabajar, los bajo el palo sin hablar
Dile jordán el significado de ser leal (Se reporta el menor)

Enmascarao como el Zorro, ando solo soy el Horrellender
Los enemigos me ven, se las ponen y gritan danger
Blindao de negro completo, abran paso llegó Darth Vader,
Batman siempre fue el mejor por eso nunca fue un Avenger
Vaqueros llegó pancho villa, me encanta el protagonismo
De que van a roncarme a mi cabrones de lo mismo
Ya yo estoy acá arriba sigue subiendo la cuenta
De aquí yo los espero con Las toro bajo cuentas
Me dicen Kevin Durant el 35 de los thunder
Por que sin mi la giny sin coger ni un solo conver
Esto no es Toy Story buddy agarrate el sombrero
Que el menor no está jugando, preguntale a los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

¡pusho!
Hoy cambiamos la history no tuve que engancharme en la fory,
Porque ando con 10 vaqueros y no son los de toy story
Reverencia tranquilo, abranle paso al pupilo
Que en estilo me lo tasaron este un millón de kilos
Tanto file, las tarjetas negras no me da decline
Yo nunca pierdo aunque me vaya Cinco veces over time
Tamos a lo fucker llenando hasta los estadios de soccer
El acto principal muchachos, volvió Paul Walker
Doble U me dijo que rompa
Que yo soy la A porque se come alas compás
Matando a estos rajeros que se meten en todos los agujeros
Soy el único novato rompiendo en los vaqueros

Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day

And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down and the way that you got them all losing it
Get it, lit, shake it, shake it
Bounce, turn up, level, level

Don't wanna look you in the fa-a-ace

She was movin' with her glasses on
I felt the fire in my feet
Get away while the night's still young
Baby don't you know how it feels
To get days and months and years
Trapped inside a waking dream
I bet ya you and I sit back tonight and try
To make it more than just a fantasy

'Cause we are fast youth goin' nowhere
Burnin' this town like we don't care
Nothin' you say could ever put out our fire, no no

We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
'Cause outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight it's just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend, oh

Bittersweet like every summer fling
And keeping up with all your stories
Talking to your ghost when I'm asleep

No you're never really dead to me
Maybe that's the mystery of us
I use to think when you were gone
I would still hear voices in the halls

I can feel the red rain on me
I can see you shaking when I kiss
You still hit me like a buzz
Seventeen and drunk enough to wish

And you really got your hooks on me
Maybe that's the punishment for love
I still stay up late at night
Trying to hear your voices in the halls

Un'attesa, pari a un'agonia. Troppe volte vorrei dirti: no
E poi ti vedo e tanta forza non ce l'ho
Il mio cuore si ribella a te, ma il mio corpo no
Le mani tue, strumenti su di me,
che dirigi da maestro esperto quale sei...

E vieni a casa mia, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra' per una notte...
... E cresce sempre piu' la solitudine,
nei grandi vuoti che mi lasci tu!

Rinnegare una passione no,
ma non posso dirti sempre si' e sentirmi piccola cosi'
tutte le volte che mi trovo qui di fronte a te.
Troppo cara la felicita' per la mia ingenuita'.
Continuo ad aspettarti nelle sere per elemosinare amore...

So - no sempre tua, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra', per una notte... sono tua...
... la notte a casa mia, sono tua, sono mille volte tua...

E la vita sta passando su noi, di orizzonti non ne vedo mai!
Ne approfitta il tempo e ruba come hai fatto tu,
il resto di una gioventu' che ormai non ho piÃ¹...
E continuo sulla stessa via, sempre ubriaca di malinconia,
ora ammetto che la colpa forse e' solo mia,
avrei dovuto perderti, invece ti ho cercato.

Neri Per Caso,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere",Here There and Everywhere,2007
Neri Per Caso,"Settemila caffè
Li ho già presi perché 
Sono stanco di stare al volante 
E vorrei arrivare entro sera da te 
Che aspetti, me? Nel castello lassù 
Con la treccia già sciolta 
Affacciata al balcone, vestita di blu 

Settemila caffè
È l'effetto che ho 
Quando arrivo al portone e 
Ti vedo gridare con gli occhi il mio nome perciò 
Vieni verso di me e io pazzo di te 
In un attimo ci diamo il bacio 
Più dolce, più dolce che c'è 

Ho bisogno di te 
Perché sei bella e poi 
Ho bisogno di tutte quelle cose che non hai 
Ho bisogno di te 
Come l'acqua il caffè 
Come un mondo che gira e che
Amore se non vuoi
Non finirà mai 
Oh non finirà mai 

Ad esempio lo sai 
L'altra sera ero a casa 
Cercavo da bere ma il frigo era vuoto 
Perché non ho fatto la spesa 
Tu non ci crederai 
Indovina che c'è? 
Ho trovato una tazza 
Con l'ultimo dei settemila caffè 

Ora sto qui da solo e non dormo e non volo 
Mentre tu sei lontana 
Ripenso a una scena di te senza velo 
Non so bene cos'è 
Forse i troppi caffè 
Ma stanotte non riesco a dormire 
E l'amore lo faccio da me 

Ho bisogno di te 
Perché sei bella e poi 
Ho bisogno di tutte quelle cose che mi fai 
Ho bisogno di te 
Come l'acqua il caffè 
Come un mondo che gira e che
Amore se non vuoi
Non finirà mai 
Oh amore mio non finirà mai 
In questo mondo che gira e che
Amore se non vuoi
Non finirà mai 
Oh non finirà mai",7000 Caffè,2008
Neri Per Caso,"Balla balla ballerino tutta la notte e al mattino
Non fermarti balla su una tavola fra due montagne
E se balli sulle onde del mare io ti vengo a cercare
Prendi il cielo con le mani vola in alto più degli aeroplani
Non fermarti sono pochi gli anni forse sono solo giorni
E stan finendo tutti in fretta e in fila
Non ce n'è uno che ritorni
Balla non aver paura se la notte è fredda e scura
Non pensare alla pistola che hai puntato contro
Balla alla luce di mille sigarette e di una luna
Che ti illumina a giorno balla il mistero
Di questo mondo che brucia in fretta quello che ieri era vero
Dammi retta non sarà vero domani
Ferma con quelle tue mani il treno Palermo-Francoforte
Per la mia commozione c'è una ragazza al finestrino
Gli occhi verdi che sembrano di vetro
Corri e ferma quel treno fallo tornare indietro
Balla anche per tutti i violenti veloci di mano e coi coltelli
Accidenti se capissero vedendoti ballare di essere
Morti da sempre anche se possono respirare
Vola e balla sul cuore malato illuso sconfitto poi abbandonato
Senza amore dell'uomo che confonde la luna con il sole
Senza avere coltelli in mano ma nel suo povero cuore
Allora vieni angelo benedetto prova a mettere i piedi sul suo petto
E stancarti a ballare al ritmo del motore ed alle grandi parole
Di una canzone canzone d'amore ecco il mistero
Sotto un cielo di ferro e di gesso l'uomo riesce ad amare lo stesso
Ama davvero senza nessuna certezza
Che commozione che tenerezza",Balla Ballerino,2008
Neri Per Caso,"È solo un addio,
Credimi io non ci penso mai.
Vedo che hai pianto

È bello vedere le luci laggiù
Io sono stanco
Non voglio parlare… parla tu
Bella d'estate vai via da me

Forse perché ti credevo felice così
Proprio così fra le mie braccia
Forse perché ci bastava arrivare fin qui
Come onde di notte sulla spiaggia

Piccoli fuochi,
Noi siamo zingari di periferia
I nostri son giochi
Che durano poco
E la notte se li porta via

Forse perché ti credevo felice così
Proprio così fra le mie braccia
Forse perché ci bastava arrivare fin qui
Come onde di notte sulla spiaggia

Neri Per Caso,"La mia sigaretta brilla rossa 
Insieme a luci di periferia 
Zampate della vita sulle mie ossa 
Sei più sincera quando dici una bugia 

Sull'asfalto acquoso una luna affilata 
Tagliare i fili che legano le stelle 
Stringo al cuore una lattina vuota 
E scopro che hai lasciato le unghie sulla mia pelle 
Finestrini aperti a dissetarmi di vento 
La mia ruota incollata sulla striscia bianca 
Della mezzeria 

Gli occhi come due pezzi di vetro 
Tu non sei come ti credevo io 
Un autotreno mi ruggisce dietro 
Ma perché hai fatto il mondo così triste, Dio? 

Alberi si drizzano ai lati della strada 
Mi corrono accanto e il buio se l'inghiotte 
Alla radio un rock arrabbiato come un pugno allo stomaco 
Che mi stringe nella notte 
Un dolore e un lampo di fuoco rosso 
Dentro a questo amore che io non posso, io non posso più 

Voglio andar via 
I piedi chiedono dove ma via 
Tanto non ti perderò perché tu non sei stata mai mia 
Voglio andar via 
Da quei tuoi occhi che tirano sassi 
E come in un duello far dieci passi e poi 
Guardarci un'ultima volta e via 

Dimmi che cos'è che ci hanno fatto 
Dimmi cosa c'è che io non so 
Perché tutto è finito come cenere in un piatto 
E quei ragazzi che eravamo no, non ci sono più 

E scambiare due parole brevi 
Con la notte blu dei benzinai 
Io ti baciavo mentre tu piangevi 
E adesso che io piango, tu chi bacerai? 

Un caffè che drizza i capelli, un pacchetto di fumo 
E il vento rilegge il mio giornale 
E domani uscire di nuovo, farmi una faccia allegra 
Per il prossimo Carnevale 
Un dolore freddo come un rasoio 
Per un altro giorno che nasce, muoio, muoio, muoio 

Voglio andar via 
I sogni cercano dove ma via 
Anche all'inferno ci sarà qualcuno a farmi compagnia 
Voglio andar via 
Da te, che goccia a goccia hai spremuto il mio cuore 
E dagli straccivendoli ricomprare quel che resta 
Del mio amore e andare via",Via,2008

To whisk you off to your new premiere
And all the friends who knew your name
Are waiting, wondering what became
Of the girl that they once knew but never loved
They never loved.

So every city tells the lie
Of beggars, tramps and butterflies
Of all these things, then what am I?
A princess in a threadbare gown,
A gaudy, painted circus clown?
A child who lost her key and can't get home?

All the things I never was 
A traitor in the Western Wars
A girl who did it just because.
Do or die, or don't at all

Prepare to suffer for your call
Some things have to hurt or they're not true.

They can't be true
When you die, you'll wonder, ""was that it?""
Will you think of how you'd wished you lived?
Well, you're here now
Yes you're here now.
So I only want to be up there
With a hundred others, I don't care
Cause I'm here now
Yes I'm here now.

Papers, books, philosophy
An envelopes eternity
I count each passing minute, hour, day
Wonder how I smile so well,
Wonder how they never tell
There's really no one living here at all.

So here a line from God's own song
To comfort you when things go wrong
My children never visit anymore.
Go searching in my sky at night
They must be there to set alight
Their mothers aching heart is so unsure
I'm so unsure

When you die, you'll wonder, ""was that it?""

""I think I'm losing the fight,
Or the fight's losing me, I'm not certain,""
And here we are-the closing scenes,
And all the house lights come up,
Oh, the falling of our final curtain...
I've played a role for so long that I've forgotten myself,
But I said I'd be there and I'm keeping my word,
You've played yourself so well,
And now I want to be you,
A great imitation of losing my nerve.

Oh, it's over,
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,
But I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,
I know that everything means nothing,
On the road to Damascus they fell.

I saw the light-I saw the light!
But hey, it never saw me,
Oh, conversation has just left me heathen,
And we could wait a thousand years,
Perhaps a million or more,
If it's worth waiting for, but I'm leaving,
So on to a mecca of earthly delights,
Depression is only desire deprived,
Once more unto the breach and fuck my getting it right,
We've died for so long, let's just get out alive.

'Cause it's over,
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,
But I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,
I know that everything means nothing,
On the road to Damascus they fell,
Well I've been to Damascuc.

It's hell, hell is where I'm gonna be,
The devil my intimate friend,
And hell is other people's hearts,
And knowing that everything must end.

Oh, it's over...
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,

Well, I've been to Damascus as well.

It's a wonder that I'm standing on my own two feet.
In the shadow of a thousand veiled Victorian goodbyes
Jewels of litter come to greet me, and it stings my eyes.
Oh it burns like a fire and it pulls me through-
We are parted by desire for the strange and new.
I've got a quarter in my pocket, I'm advancing to the booth,
I am picking up and praying that I talk to you.

And now, I'm halfway home, I'm at the corner of our street,
Would you like to come and meet me?
Now that I am halfway home
Man, I never felt so lonely-
I long for you to hold me now I'm home.

Somedays, there was comfort as a stranger far from home
Sometimes, a hunger and a longing not to be alone.
Imagining emotion in each man that I would meet-
But it was physics, and subtraction, to an ancient beat.
Oh, it burned like a fire and I wore it so...
We are tied up in desire and we won't let go.
Well, I've no quarter in my pocket of no apple left to eat;
I am running, I am running and I can't feel my feet.

And now, I'm halfway home, I'm at the corner of our street,
Would you like to come and meet me?
Now that I'm halfway home
Man, I never felt so lonely-
I long for you to hold me now I'm home

Now I'm home, home is where I wanna be,
Now I'm home, home is where I'm gonna be.
Past the church and past the steeple,
Past the sad and lonely people,
Past the old school on the avenue,
I am running, I am running...

And now, I'm halfway home, I'm at the corner of our street,
Would you like to co9me and meet me
Now that I'm halfway home

Will you do something for me?
Tell them my story, tell them well
Tell them everything you know

Born of love and cradled in a misfit history
Of blind faith and pantomime
Oh, I know what I am but I don't see
So if I die tomight, if I give up the fight
Will you do something for me?

What will carry on?
When we're dead and gone
When there's nothing left

And I spent the day in a sidewalk café writing
I wrote thirty postcards all to you and every one said

I was supposed to meet Maria, but we got our signal crossed
So I walked along the Rive Gauche multiplying
I bought raspberries and the Daily News
And something to take home to make you happy
I hope it works, it'll have to

And I dreamed last night
Of how the moonlight shines in your old room
And the fight that put me on this flight that brought me here
With no one to talk to

I took myself to the cinema and mostly closed my eyes
But every now and then I paid attention
And every now and then there was a word I understood
I got the joke and that's enough for today

It was so self-assured

Have you ever wondered what happens when you become light?
It happened to me
I travelled between two worlds
Between here and there
Between there
It was a dream
Except it wasn't like a normal dream
I was awake
Would you like to see what I saw, feel what I felt?
I'll take you there
Try not to think
Just breathe
Try not to think
Now close your eyes

Now close your eyes

Would you like to see what I saw, feel what I felt?
I'll take you there

Hook me up with the melody

Hit me with the beat

Leave your vocal points at the door
No submerged rhyme tactics
Keep your soul
Whilst shattering verbal lyrical fractures
All content seen in context, it just reflects
When the beat pulses the system
Who knows what comes next?
Architect of the arch musical dynasty
Once again another set from the S.A.B.R.E
Headphones set alight from the heat we supply
Voltage on high elements elevate to the sky
Derive the means like slim
But never shady on premier
Cultivating, Navigating, air raiding through sound layers
Debutant when first dropping beats elevating vinyl cuts
You didn't see it coming till the force pressured motion to bust
Raw facts, True essence don't echo through all raps
We need to counteract bringing them soul claps
Ignite roots connection, Express new projections
Innovative, Creative styles in which were blessed with.

And you be growing them rude-ngati dreads
White on white sneaks and baggy jeans
Got that greenstone around your neck

I came from the 183
So I know a little bit about fresh bee
Yes we, keep rep?n and rock?n that fresh steez
Jeans cut with socks and jandals
Aloha shirts be the formal dress standard
Spot the poly?s from a mile away
And you know they're coming when you hear this play

Follow the leader.... leader.... leader
Follow the leader x 2

You?re so fresh so I want to know if you're down
'cause if you are then let that hair down baby

Got 2 fried eggs on that $1 bread

Brothers roll past, speakers on full blast
Singing ?Korero Maori e?

Ya?ll know what I'm talking bout the Sunday Feeds
2 minute noodles & that fried Corned Beef
For the rest of the week, that?s all there is
Go to school and scab off the rest of the kids
Save that bus money home for that $1 chips
If you don?t walk it off it goes straight to the hips..

I run my time by the change of sky,
I run my time like my appetite,

It?s the real McCoy making all that noise,
More FOB than FALL OUT BOY?.

If I still had the work I getcha sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good on the first and the third

Take you back when I was sixteen wits a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars

And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga drinking straight brown (7/11 nigga you know)

You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why you think they love me so much (ha ha!)

Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows

Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin wit dem hoes (projects!)

Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV

Ya elle aiment les mecs qui parlent trop dealeur du ghetto
Qui montre son biff elle lui met une équipe sur le dos

Pas de flashes pour nos clichés nous on s'lève juste pour pisser
Le passé est masqué, l'avenir sera postiché
Personne ne bouge, personne n'est blessé
Prêt à agresser pour percer à la Jamel Debouzze
Tu reconnais mon flow devant tant d'impostures

On va parchoquer la roue car elle ne tourne pas, c'est l'heure du partage
Nique sa mère faire son paquetage
Ne joue pas avec la rue car elle ne joue pas
Où j'passe la zeb ne repousse pas
J'ai glissé ma peine et mon insomnie dans la feuille à rouler
Cagoulés on baise les poules et les poulets

Les journées passent vite, pour les âmes tristes
Menottés à l'automne, le brouillard s'invite dans nos vies
Pour s'réchauffer, ça boit des litres
Les gens qui dorment dehors savent que le froid n'est pas un pitre
""La planète est petite"" tu t'dis quand t'es seul
Rien à faire le dimanche, heureusement qu'y a la console
La camisole en banlieue, c'est tous les jours dimanche
Dans la cour d'école, la neige tombe, j'attends ma revanche
L'été est parti il a fait fondre mon avance
Déficitaire à la SACEM, un join d'seum j'écris ma souffrance
La vodka pour faire monter les degrés
Camouflé dans une parka vers le soleil j'rêve d'émigrer
Les feuilles tombent des arbres comme les miens
Ceux qui restent dehors, se comptent sur les doigts d'une main

Même à bout de souffle les larmes restent froides
Triste comme la pluie, qui tombe et coule sur le fil de la vie
Même si au bout du jour il n'y a que la nuit et ses jeux interdits
Qui volent et courent comme la poudre qu'on se jette aux yeux

La légende d'hiver s'écrit au parpaing
Les hussiers c'est le Père Noël, ils t'prennent tout, même ton sapin
Pour certains les fêtes sont cruelles, ils bouffent un festin
Au charbon en silence, dans les ruelles le matin
Célibataire, l'bonhomme de neige roule un patin
J'ai raté l'entretien, je m'inquiète pas, l'avenir m'appartient
La brume d'ahya jusqu'à Porte de Pantin
Rhoya chante mon déclin, on s'bat pour tout ce qu'on obtient
C'est l'Alaska, mon coeur n'arrive plus à faire ""boum boum""
Ma Doudoune? Un gilet pare-balle, la saison tourne en boucle
J'suis rarement là, chérie j'comprend pourquoi tu boudes
J'assume mes bourdes, arrêtes de croire qu'j'en ai rien à foutre!
Mc, prépares-toi, j'arrive sur toi comme la foudre

Sur la banquise. les roses poussent pas à fleury

Un spliff mon safari, c'est quoi le tarif?

J'reste un vrai c'est pour ça qu'il m'encourage
Après la pluie, y'a pas le beau temps y'a l'orage
C'est vrai que les petits sont hardcore, on était pareil à leur âge
À deux sur un scooter on vivez que de vol à l'arrach'
Puis on a connu la crave-bi et on a vite tourné la page
J'me suis mis à couper des barrettes, ensuite à vendre des plaquettes
Puis d'la coke et des galettes, jusqu'à ce que les keufs nous arrêtent
Un jour j'étais dans le 19, l'lendemain un hessess fermait ma porte
Un soir j'étais avec une meuf, l'lendemain elle était avec mon pote
La vie c'est dur, pas de peine nous tout ce qu'on porte c'est des flingues
Et y'a pas de vice de procédure gros c'est la loi de la jungle
C'est pas d'ma faute, darwah, j'crois bien que j'suis taré d'naissance
J'me reconnais pas moi-même des fois j'suis ravi de faire ma connaissance
Et quand je pars au shtar, bah t’inquiète pas que j'reçois des mandats
Et j'ai toujours la frappe, tah hollanda et bellanda
J'suis rabtah, zoogataga sous ma véranda
J'glisse mes doigts dans les cheveux tah Esmeralda
J'emmerde l'Etat, j'emmerde les stups, j'emmerde les gendarmes
Trafiquant de rimes, trafiquant d'stups ou trafiquant d'armes
Je suis, comment vous dites? 
Paranoïaque, ouais
Je m'en bat les yeuc', madame la juge baraneyek
J'te l'avais dit que j'avais des projets
Là j'graille des brochettes, j'insulte ta mère et j'touche des gros chèques
J’achète des trucs qui valent chères, rien qu'avant hier
J'me suis acheté 3-4 t-shirt, j'ai dépensé ton salaire
J'me suis roulé un gros sdeh, puis j'ai repensé à la misère
A cet été, à cet hiver, quand on était au val-d'Isère
Au mitar tah la Santé, les promenades en camembert
Au mitar tah Fleury, j'revois les toilettes j'me dis beurk!
A les bâtards, comment ils ont pu me faire ça?
Ils me l'ont mise j'leur est remise woogata vice et versa
Yaa zéh obligé de se faire remarquer, pas obligé de se faire embarquer déféré au parquet
Direction les grillages, bon, trêve d'enfantillage
Yeah, I speak a little English, motherfucking biatch!
Ould l'kahba what you gonna do Ok j'continue tout doux j'big up le rott' Mamadou
Yoogata yoogata gangz to gangz
Ouais, tu connais la musique, celui qui veux teste j'le baise

Ban-ban-bandit j'fait que du propre, j'effectue les sales tâches
Ça sert à quoi de jouer le pirate, si t'enquilles pas à l'abordage
Ils dopent en dopant, co on t'laisse le dos en deux
On est nous-mêmes en (?) exorciste avec un joint d'beuh
Tous les soirs j'dégrise, nos combines se développent
Mais des fois les quis' débarquent et dans les comptes ça fait des flops
Du crime ouais y'a la crème, Sta-ive c'est du vécu
Mon gros, chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Pas de X que t’achètes avec alcool et abus
De plus, j'baise ces nabots qui croient contrôler la rue
Les yeux cernés au poste, menotté à des barreaux de chaise
J'rêve d'Îles Vierges m'en fumer avec des barreaux de chaises
La nuit j'dors mal, éternellement tourmenté
En pensant que j'vais prendre cher si les keufs arrivent à tout remonter
Ceux qui sèment le vent, récolte du ons dans le ventre
A-L, futur ex-braqueur reconverti dans la vente

J'aimerais partir tranquille, les pieds d'vant
Un monde de fils de pute, j'suis obligé de vendre
Ah bon? 
Ça suffit pas alors on braque sa mère
M’en voulais pas dans le rap y'a trop de Zehmel
3 Quart, belle coupe, chico cassé
La vie c'est speed même mon ombre veut me dépasser
Oh, le sky est classé, j'suis chaud
Menacé ne sert à rien, j't'envoie 2-3 balles l'affaire est classé
Ramassé du biff, voilà dans quoi j'me suis perdu
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais ces vertus
Hyper dur, fréquentation malsaine
Chiale pas sur mon sort, tu sais qu'ici personne nous accepte
On connaît le respect, Les valeurs et les principes
T'es le plus grand des hommes si tu te lèves pour bosser à Rungis
Malheureusement pas mon cas, au fond de moi je les envies
Nos vies, c'est faire du biff, mais resté en vie
Donc faut marcher armé, puis avoir la trique
Aujourd'hui t'allume demain t'es matrixé
C'est la vie du western, la vie d'moi j'suis réel
La tranquillité frérot est bloqué dans mes rêves
Impossible de l'avoir, je ne prend jamais de rotte-ca
Mais Belek au feu le couz si tu mets trop de bois
Beaucoup de salopes font les voyous, wallah que c'est pas une fierté
Dit moi qui sera là le jour ou t'auras vraiment merdé
J'ai l'orgueil d'un bébé, je m'énerve et je pète tout
J'assume les conséquences khey dans mes bras je prend le mektoub
Oui j'aime pas les poulets et je ferais recette sans eux
Une impression même jaloux de ma mère à 700E
Ils m'inventent des vies, le mythe ils veulent casser
Hum j'en ai assez, les traquer, les chlasser
Quand j'allais tu revenais, dans ta tête ça ne rentre pas
Je le ferais tout les jours, je compte l'oseille me dérange pas
Bien sur qu'on s'est fait tout seul, je sais très bien que tu sais
J'ai braqué des bijouteries quand les autres allaient sucer
Sans t'manquer de respect, dans l'rap dit moi ce qui est facile
Frérot on viens de la rue c'est des filles faciles

J'ai roulé ma bosse, j'en ai marre d'bouffer d'la merde
Coup d'crosse la vie t'assommes pire qu'un joint d'herbe
Tout ce qu'on a on finit par l'perdre
Étoile de mer 10 000 kilomètres
Perdu sur la lune verte
J'sui tellement loin des ""je veux être""
Berad d'aatay j'allume un Jaabouq à la fenêtre
T'es dans l'paraitre moi j'vais disparaitre
Les kheys passent au dispatching, une mère qui pleure c'est la faute d'un traitre
Y'a plus que des bras cassés dis-moi à qui serrer les coudes?
Six pieds sous terre quand j'me ferais bouffer par l'doud
Noyer dans le doute, j'suis toujours dans le hood
Les yeux rouges, oui dead casa negra j'suis pas un l'blood
Passe moi des feuilles ce soir j'fume mes dernières illusions
Sers moi un verre que j'tourne cette tragédie en dérision
11.43, Mortuaire sera la saison
Maintenant j'marche avec des rétros, dis qui va m'sauter l'caisson
Y'a y'a y'a plus d'rage que d'la fashionnerie
J'enterre l'espoir dans un parloir à Fleury
Ghetto youth langage, du whisky, les chicos pourries
Bonbon sauvage 0.4 roya sourit

Heh-hep-pep, Dieu seul est maitre de ma destinée
Moi j'me verrais bien à La Mecque avec mes rents-pa et ma dulcinée
La vie c'est pas un clip ni du ciné ou une bande dessinée
On va peut-être finir à Clairvaux, on va peut-être s'faire assassiner
C'est clair gros qu'on peut tout perdre sur un coup d'ker-po
J'te parle d'une boite ou pour rentrer y'a même pas besoin d'se faire beau
Le cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
Quand j'ai fêté mes 16 ans c'est pas du plomb que j'avais dans le cerveau

J'ai 28 ans j'habite dans l'zoo je m'appelle Eddy Chabard
J'veux réussir, j'veux m'en sortir depuis que j'suis tout petit je chabarde
J'ai bicrave, j'ai fais plein d'conneries dont j'suis pas du tout fier
Comme les aller-retours à Fleury pour battre le fer faut du fer
Pour faire du flouze faut du flouze, des couilles et d'la gamberge
Surtout quand t'es seul contre tous y'a personne pour te tendre la perche
Moi Alhamdulillah j'suis pas comme ça j'préfère aider mon prochain
Car j'sais que Dieu me l'rendra ici bas ou dans un monde prochain
Lah yaalem bi kolchi, hata tkoun labes Gucci
Lmout tji ou tadik

J'arrive dans l'game avec You pour écraser tous ces chiens
Même s'ils sont plein on les baise tous kalachnikov à la main
Ca va péter dans l'quartier, dans tous les ghettos d'France
Ayat-al kursi 11.43 pour me souhaiter bonne chance
M'en bas les couilles de c'que tu penses, depuis ma tendre enfance
J'laisse la concurrence en transe lourde sera la sentence
Brulux on the flux toujours dans les bacs
Hier ils m'boycottaient maintenant ils veulent faire mes bacs
Prochain clip j'appelle Fredo il m'prépare le Maybach
Cette fois ci j'ferais pas l'gamin promis j'cacherais tes blacks
Ils m'ont pris pour une blague, des mesures il m'en reste quatre
Pour ma mère j'veux du 2.4 pour moi qamis, un RS4
Dédicace l'Algérie, le Maroc, la Tunisie
Faudra bientôt retourner chez nous car y'a trop d'crapules ici

Parce que tu manges du lion le matin devant moi tu veux rugir
Approche j'te mets une claque de roumain tu vas rougir
Plus tu vas monter plus les rumeurs vont surgir
Personne ne se fie d'personne écoutes bien tout ce que j'vais te dire
Tout ce qui est autour de moi, j'vais te l'exploser
La j'pète les plombs j'ai retiré la goupille j'fais exploser
A ma droite les frères mus' débarque pour nous faire des rappels
Pas la quand j'suis (?) les appelle
En primaire j'te frappais ouai j'me prenais pour l'king
A 10 ans au comico voiture péta dans un parking
Le quartier c'est une plaque tournante, ça défouraille de partout
Dans mon escalier j'tombe sur un sac remplis d'billets j'garde tout
Assis sur un banc toute la journée sa bibi
Dans les bois ça fais bep-bep ou cric-cric bim bim!
Au collège, lycée voilà les (?) moi j'casse des dents
Avec (?) ou pas leurs uppercuts te rentre dedans
On sais que la police nous surveille mais elle ne sait pas tout
Les malins savent très bien que l'argent ne fait pas tout
On a des avocats mais ils n'arrangent pas tout
Les médecins sont la mais il ne soignent pas tout
Pas de chance cette nuit la juge s'est fait mal baisée
Donc forcément des chance d'être acquitté on baissées
T'es pressé, t'accélères risquer sont les raccourcis
Kazou dis leur que cette est pute est plus de soucis que d'surcis

Posé à la tess j'ai rien vu, rien entendu
J'ves-qui les histoires tendu
Des fois c'est tes potes qui t'enculent
Avec du recul
J'ai fini par devenir solitaire
Pour l'Etat on a pas les critères
Donc on a fini sur le ter
J'vois des pères, des mères qui travaillent dur pour ceux qu'ils aiment
Wallah ça m'fait de la peine d'les rentrer pour rien dans nos problèmes
11.43 c'est le thème
La c'est Tirgo sur l'antenne
Poto dès l'début de l'enquête c'est possible que tu perds la tête
Envoie la frappe de Ketama dédicace à Khadama
J'suis obligé d'faire du sale y'a toute la cité derrière moi
Y'en a qui braquait des tabacs nous on bicravait du taga
Ouai continuer à taguer nous on à pas l'temps on tabasse
On va t'laisser aux aguets dé-ter comme l'armée du Hamas
J'savais pas que sur ce banc ouais j'allais fumer des kamas
Toute l'année tu fais des phases poto, c'est pas comme a-ç
Dans l'arène j'ai toujours la faille, flow qui tire comme un Fa-mas
Nous on est comme des hommes, on va toujours à la chasse
Y'a du biff' et des liasses obligé on s'déplace
Sa bicrave au fond de l'impasse
Désolé si ça dépasse
Dans ton bigo y'a les vrais et les boloss que t'effaces

We-wesh la racaille, les raclures la police en a ras-le-cul
Ma vie c'est un texte de rap remplit d'ratures
Nerveux l'sourire aux lèvres doté d'pouvoir céleste
J'ai perdu l'nord ma direction à moi c'est l'est
J'écris des textes de fou, beaucoup métaphorique
L'histoire d'un braqueur qui finit par taffer au Ritz
Rosny-sous-Bois, la Sambuy, les braquos, les sous-salles
Les sous-sols, les mouses, ceux qui moussent et qui s'débat ainsi qu'les douzes
J'rappe, je pense comme un mec de la ur
J'aime la pure qui branche les clients sur mon terrain tout les jours
J'ai pas d'bonnes habitudes j'descends et j'traine
J'truande j'ves-qui la justice dédicace à Fresnes
Les sirènes retentissent, les criminels se repentissent
La pisse du sheïtan, mes repentises, ma hantise
C'est vraiment pas la mort mais c'qui s'en suit
J'aime quand ça va que dans un sens (Oui!)
Quand c'est classé sans suite
Moi j'ai ramé, ramené la merde à mes rents-pa
Et j'donne tout à mes frères marlich s'ils me le rendent pas
La justice on s'la fait nous même, I'm so Hood!
Un dialogue de sourd entre moi et ma bouteille d'Absolut
Me parle pas d'la gloire n'y même du sommet (Nan, nan, nan)
Pour l'instant j'me bas pour finir la semaine
Mais guette moi j'suis la j'rappe sale vas-y acquiesce
De nos jours tu peux rater l'grand amour si t'as pas d'caisse

Sta-ive c'est du vécu
On comprend que chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Oui c'est l'cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

[Chorus: x2]
I'm in the air
High in the air

KC, Nesto!

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is

Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight Ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down, below those who get caught up in my Rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

[Chorus: x4]

Your first lesson for today man
That was it, Sickology 101
Y'all know what I mean
Craig Smith, Nesto, Tech Nina nigga
In the air, motherfucker
Sound like a bird flying around
Yeah, Wyshmaster on the track

Que me dirá 
Recordada Denisse 
Pensando en mil cosas quizá 
Con el humo por testigo 
Esta carta empece a redactar"" 

Querida mía, perdona 
Si te ofendo al escribirte 
Pero me siento muy triste 
Por lo que anoche paso 

Hasta estoy arrepentido 
Y si acaso tu lo estas 

Ya no debes llorar mas 
Tienes que tener valor 
Por si dios te manda un hijo 

Por lo mas grande te exijo 
Que no le pongas mi nombre 
Para que no sea 
Como yo 

Que nunca pruebe licor 
Que nunca sufra una pena 
Y que nunca se enamore 
De la mujeres ajenas 

Que nunca sienta rencor 
Que a mi me corre en las venas 

Por que es triste soportar 
Esta terrible condena",La Carta,2003
Nestor Daniel,"Si arrastré por este mundo 
La vergüenza de haber sido 
Y el dolor de ya no ser, 
Bajo el ala del sombrero 
Cuantas veces embozada 
Una lágrima asomada 
Yo no pude contener

Si crucé por los caminos 
Como un paria que el destino 
Se empeñó en deshacer
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego 
Solo quiero que comprendan 
El valor que representa 
El coraje de querer

Era, para mi la vida entera 
Como un sol de primavera 
Mi esperanza y mi pasión 
Sabía, que en el mundo no cabía 
Toda la humilde alegría 
De mi pobre corazón

Ahora, cuesta abajo en mi rodada 
Las ilusiones pasadas 
Ya no las puedo arrancar
Sueño, con el pasado que añoro 
El tiempo viejo que lloro 
Y que nunca volverá

Por seguir tras de sus huellas 
Yo bebí incansablemente 
En mi copa de dolor
Pero nadie comprendía 
Que si todo yo lo daba
En cada vuelta dejaba 
Pedazos de corazón

Ahora, triste en la pendiente
Solitario y ya vencido
Yo me quiero confesar
Si aquella boca mentía 
El amor que me ofrecía 
Por aquellos ojos brujos 
Yo habría dado siempre más

Pompeya y, más alla, la inundación,
tu melena de novia en el recuerdo,
y tu nombre flotando en el adios...
La esquina del herrero barro y pampa,
tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjon
y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
que me llena de nuevo el corazón.

Sur... paredón y después...
Sur... una luz de almacen...
Ya nunca me veras como me vieras,
recostado en la vidriera
y esperandote,

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
y mi amor en tu ventana
todo ha muerto, ya lo se.

San Juan y Boedo antiguo, cielo perdido,
Pompeya y, al llegar al terraplen,
tus veinte años temblando de cariño
bajo el beso que entonces te robe.

pesadumbre del barrio que ha cambiado
y amargura del sueño que murio.

Mil e uma noites
De amor com você

When the ice that clings onto your beard is clinging agony?
And you snatch your rattling last breaths with deep sea diver sounds?

Slowly, life is running through my fingers like sand
Call me, and I'll be wherever you are
Lonely, and the day hides a falling star
And I tried so hard, yes I tried to get out
But the fear kept on strangling my will
And I tried so hard, yes I tried to get out
But the chains they were harder than steel
Lonely, when the bird calls the break of dawn
Lonely, when nightfall takes lovers in it's arms
Lonely, when meadows outside grow green
Falling, and the waters take what has been
Flowing, show me a place where I can fall asleep

And I tried so hard...

I’m not too shabby. Brought Gabby and Maggie and Sandy and Danny, all from Cincinnati, to laugh at your daddy. Wow, you were hated, I had it gold plated on a desk thanking death that I'm happy you made it.

Neurotics,"Saturday night smashed out of my brains
Laying on the floor looking really intelligent

All of my dreams have gone down the drain

It just goes to show I wasn't paying attention

In every way.

Chorus:

oh, oh look at me
I'm as hip as I can be
I'm wasted, just look at the mess I am in. Spent half of the night walking the streets
Looking for a party that never existed
Every week is just the same
Well we talked about sex but never of love
We bragged about girls with which we'd had fun
Oh but the thing that's really sad
We never had.
Chorus:
I was brilliant at school but not in exams
My teachers they could not understand
How five years work went to the wall
And then I got into trouble 'cause I got in the way
When things went wrong, well I got the blame
I was Idle through no fault of my own
None of my own.
Chorus:
Oh, look at me no-one 'round here wants me
I'm wasted just look at the mess I am in.

I had problems with my parents

Sleeping all day long
And you know no one, 'cause you don't go out,

'Cause you've got no work

But it's really those in power that stab you in the back

Pintando en tu vientre
La sombra de un beso mágico.

Neutral Drop,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

Old men with kazoos and beating drums
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream

It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading

Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile
We could close the door and sleep all day

Inside my bedroom all alone

There is no use in waiting 
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings 
Etched in the middle of the night

Let me hear the rain tap on your street

As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer

And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
Till wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes

And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs
And when the day it came to pour all her babies
All across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more",A Baby for Pree,1996

And some you leave behind

And filled up our garden with snow

Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you

She comes and goes most afternoons

And he said...Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string. 
And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over 
With two cracks along both sides 
And I knew the world was over so I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching 
Up to the weather vane and the tops of trees 
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
And pretty girls and the burning men 
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face 
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in a fountain 
To save my soul from all these troubled times 
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take 
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards 
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country 
Finds a nice cliff to drop off

As it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you but they found you
And they took you and you somehow survived

(There is no dream)
So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes

And I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creek
With them ever proclaiming me me oh

Up and over
We go the weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine machine

Neutral Milk Hotel,"Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath
Chasing the only
Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty bright and bubbly
Terrible scene that was doing her thing on your chest
But oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory you're
Drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all

Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty bright and bubbly
Friend you could need to say comforting things in your ear

But oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find
Here standing next to me only my enemy
I'll crush him with everything i own
Say what you want to say hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle for me

Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies
While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful all in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden was all you were needing
When you still believed in me
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle for me

I know they buried her body with others
Her sister and mother and 500 families
And will she remember me 50 years later
I wished i could save her in some sort of time machine
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are

Goldaline my dear
We will fold and freeze together
Far away from here
There is sun and spring and green forever
But now we move to feel
For ourselves inside some strangers stomach
Place your body here
Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine",Oh Comely,1998
Neutral Milk Hotel,"Two headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Two headed boy
Put on sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine

Two headed boy
There is no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go",Two-Headed Boy,1998
Neutral Milk Hotel,"Daddy please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams
For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet

Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine
How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep 

And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying,
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet,
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes
And Ill love you for the rest of your life when you're ready

Brother see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames
And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
Push the pieces in place 
Make your smile sweet to see 
Don't you take this away 
I'm still wanting my face on your cheek

And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies 
When we break we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life

She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires

Neutral Milk Hotel,"Shadows on my wall
They creep and crawl in burning white
They dream of waterfalls
Catching slow bright streams of light.

And life can be so weird
Bucket full of fear
But it's alright
I'm on an isle

And I've still got time to fly away
Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you
I'm hoping all these things

And the strength they bring will pull me through

And I've still got time to fly away.",Bucket,1998
Neutral Milk Hotel,"For I am an engine and I'm holding on
Through endless revisions to state what I mean
For sweetness alone who flew out through the window
And landed back home in a garden of green

You're riding alone in the back of a steamer
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray

And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
That milky delight that invited us all
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
Then wake up your windows and watch as those sweet babies crawl away
Oh oh dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee",Engine,1999
Neutral Milk Hotel,"There are beads that wrap 
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park like a hole in your head 
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world 
And I guess it's worth your time
'Cause there's some lives you live 
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name

Leave me alone, for you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row 
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides 
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
As long as you're something to own
Will love you s long as you're something to own

Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove 
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move 
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger 
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you",Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone,2011

Neve,"I had a dream I fell behind a hidden wall
Began to see a world through new eyes
I can't wake up I don't really want to figure out
What it means to rush right through this life 

Upside-down on a ceiling floor
I don't think I'll be coming back for more
Running blind into what I see
Not afraid to set it free
That's just the way it should be 

CHORUS:
When will the sky fall beneath us?
Will we make sense of it all?
I'm going through things in my mind
We just hide behind
And I'm not the only one 

I took a turn and got stuck inside
This played out scheme 

A revolution underneath your blue sky
I'm underground so come around and upside down
We will try
To look beyond ourselves so we both can survive


Flashback dropping in a state of bliss
Hooked up wishing but it doesn't really exist
I won't die in a dream that's dead
I'd rather take in the head
That's just the way it should be 

REPEAT CHORUS 

Well I don't know 

Upside down on a ceiling floor
I know that I'll be coming back for more
I filter out through a faded screen
A Universe so obscene
Tell me now when it's time to cut free
We'd better start living better take another leap

She said for now I can't be here
But I'm coming back
And she knows
In the same old sky
That I'll be up within the clouds
Making sure she's fine

And I don't want to be alone
You know I come from a broken home
I just can't do without it

Here I go hear me call out after you
Bouncing off of the satellites

Letting out what I'm always holding in
Gone away but I'm coming back again
Only you can get me through this

Things may change
And I'll take the blame
But what I am to you
Will remain the same
A fair exchange
When there's nothing clear
To take so many things
That I can't be near

And I don't want to be alone
You know I come from a broken home
I just can't do without it

To slow you down so we could find

Trippin' on me in your OCD
A drama queen that just won't agree
I am just the accident

Crashing out when I'm supposed to wake up
Let's come down like we're coming of age
An inside joke that doesn't quite play

I want to float away into yesterday

I've got to step up
Can't you see I'm hanging by a thread
As I creep up, I'll float out
I have to find some peace in my head

I speak up, you say the time has come
Waiting for the answer on the tip of my tongue
So what, I'm just half at ease
Cynical screaming and laughing at me

I want to float away into yesterday

Of Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars

'Cause girl you move on so quickly
Keeping a boy like me at the edge of his seat

And I know everything until it was all about your perfect image
Well I hope this song
It helps your image

I'm so over you now

And I am running out of words to say to you
Wondering why I'm wasting my time
Thinking back and wondering why I'm such a fool
For loving you

And I was the the one
Who thought I was the strong one
You proved me wrong now I'm singing along
To every song on the radio I don't wanna go
Come on baby tell me something I wanna know and I
Don't wanna say what is on my mind
Because this lack of motivation is taking over my time
And I'm sick
Of trying

And I am running out of words to say to you
Wondering why I'm wasting my time
Thinking back and wondering why I'm such a fool
For loving you

One fateful day during a walk through the jungle
She fell into the catacombes

Little does he know she's fallen into the pit
Of the beast with sixteen eyes

And eight hairy legs

Beneath the carpet of the amazon jungle
It lies and waits for helpless prey

Armed to the teeth he ventured forth

To get all crazy drunk
And start a fight?

The Calvaries charged,and the Indians fell.
The calvaries charged,and the Indians died.
Oh The Country was young then, with God on its side.

And the civil war to us, was soon laid away.
And the names of the heroes, I was made to memorize.
With guns in their hands, and God on their side.

The First World War,it came and it went.
And the reason for fighting,I never did get.
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride.
For you don't count the dead, when God's on your side.

In the nineteen-sixties,came the Vietnam war.
Can someone tell me, what we were fighting for?
So many young men died, so many mothers cried.
No I ask the question, was God on our side?

I learned to hate the russians, all through my whole life.
If another war comes, it's them must fight.
And to hate them and fear, to run and to hide.
And accept it all bravely, with God on my side.

Through many dark hours, I've been thinkin' bout' this.
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss.
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide. 
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.

Now that I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell.

I've got the fire of the gospel, a river of blues
And I got the soul of belief
And I keep trying for everything

I've got a song that's about to explode
I was born to the beat that pounds like the heat
And I've got the drums of the spirit

Brother blood, brother blood
We're from the same water, we're from the same

old brother jake had to ride the rail
Or get locked up in the parish jail
He had a lot of weight upon his chest

Where the law of the land
It was a gun and a knife

late one night, down on the avenue

While nearby an old man cries
Brother, can you, can you spare a dime?
Mother's feed their families words of hope
Keepin' faith in their fellow man
While they cope with rejection and despair

While the chance of living is going down
Though some may say things could get worse
Tell that to a hungry child or a dad without a job
When hungry homeless families become an angry mob
