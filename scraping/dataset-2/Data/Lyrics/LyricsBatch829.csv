Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
But you remained in my heart

So tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

It's so bad, It's so sad
I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do
I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"[Chorus]
Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
Hows about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
Hows about keeping steady company

I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
Cause I'm writing your name down in every page.

[Chorus]","Hey, Good Lookin'",2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son
Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son",Georgia on My Mind,2002

Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2002

As he swings back and forward in the saddle

Because the Western folks all know
He's a highfaluting, scooting, shooting son-of-a-gun from Arizona
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met

I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"Feel the autumn breeze,
It steals 'cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp,
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you,
The lonely autumn trees,
How softly they're sighing,
For summer is dying,
They know that in my heart
There's no gladness
Because there's no you,
The park that we walked in,
The garden we talked in,
How lonesome they seem in the fall,
The stormy clouds hover,
And falling leaves cover
Our favourite nook in the wall,
In spring we'll meet again,
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture we knew,
And from that day,
Never more will I say there's no you",There's No You,2002

If you're young at heart.

You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams.
And life gets more exciting with each passing day.
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart.
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart.

Look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
And here is the best part, you have a head start

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,

Willie's been fed and I've tucked him in bed, thank goodness the darling's asleep
He's a wonderful boy and a joy and a boon

Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray
But he said ""I couldn't help it, my rocking horse ran away!""
Rip rip went the curtain, wham went the window, crunch went the new buffet
And I heard him tell his daddy ""My rocking horse ran away""

Somehow Indians got into our front room
Our cowboy grabbed for his gun and went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Slam went the screen door, smash went the mirror, looks like I'll soon be gray
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some Mother's Day
I'll remember when his rocking horse ran away

Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid

Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke

Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table

Out in West Virginia
Is a little college

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

And there's a picture in the hall of fame

And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire

The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly

Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Atill shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home,

And the wind blows stronger

Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !

Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.

An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little coloured boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,

Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,

That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?

Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,

And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.",The Old Music Master,1995

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart",It Happened in Monterey,2000

When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me

Paul Whiteman,"Layin' about, lyin' in bed
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow

They stay alive this late on Radio Five
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth
'Cause the moments that I can't recall
Are moments that you treasure
Better take another measure for pleasure

Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Now you're here, I'm here too
Could be this easy for me and you

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.

It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;

Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day !
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

A hundred years from now.

When you could be learning the steps of gladness.

Here's the thing to know,

I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !

And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;

Headed home bound just once more
To my Mississippi Delta home.

Southland has that grand garden spot,
Although, you believe it or not,
I hear those breezes a-whispering, ""Come on back to me!"".

Muddy water round my feet,
Muddy water in the street,
Just Gods don't shelter
Down on the Delta!

Muddy water in my shoes,
Reelin' and rockin' to them low-down blues,
They live in comfort and ease down there,
I do declare!

Been away
A year today,
to wander and roam;
I don't care
It's muddy there,
But see, it's my home!

Got my toes turned Dixie way,
Round the Delta let me lay,
My heart cries out for muddy water!",Muddy Water,1996

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Paul Williams,"Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?

A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Hold on
If love is the answer you hold

Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more",Touch,2013

Let me be the one you run to

White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way

Before the risin' sun, we fly
So many roads to choose
We'll start out walkin' and learn to run

Paul Williams,"We'll remember you forever Eddie
Through the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love

Little Eddie Mitty born in Jersey City
Started singin' when he was five
Never knew his father mother didn't bother
To catch his last name fast as he came

He was off and flying
Times were really trying
Eddie and his mother alone
Soon another mister soon a baby sister
Mama kept swingin' and Eddie kept singin'

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

And now the tragic story
Eddie's sister, Mary Louise, needed an operation
To get the money he would have to become an overnight sensation
Eddie believed the American people
Had wonderful, lovegiving hearts
His well publicized end he considered would send
His memorial album to the top of the charts...and it did

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

When a young singer dies to our shock and surprise
In a plane crash or flashy sports car
He becomes quite well known
And the kindness he's shown has made more than one post mortem star
Well you did it Eddie and though it's hard to applaud suicide
You gave all you could give so your sister could live
All America's choked up inside

We'll remember you forever Eddie
Thru' the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love","Goodbye, Eddie, Goodbye",1974

There's nothing that's harder to find
Someone to lead us protect us and feed us
And help us to make up our minds
We need a man that's sophisticated
Quiet and strong and well educated
Where to go what to do
Could it be somebody super like you

We need a man that can stand as a symbol
And symbols have got to be tall
Someone with taste and the tiniest waist
With his help would not life be a ball
If we had fun he would not restrain us
If we got caught he would just explain us
Where to go what to do
Could it be somebody super like you

We pledge allegiance to his gracefulness and charming manners
With a voice that's both sides choice he'll bring us to our knees in admiration
He is king of all who see and hear his perfect pitch
And more surprises when his time is come a stallion rises

We need a man with a head on his shoulders a nose that is simply divine
Hollywood smile and a perfect profile and with eyes that would sparkle and shine
Long flowing hair for a crowning glory
There'd be a man who could tell our story
Where to go what to do
Could it be somebody super like you

Out of place as a cryin' clown who could only frown and the play went on for hours

One love who would stand by me and after making love we'd

Dream a bit of style
We'd dream a bunch of friends
Dream each others smile
And dream it never ends

I was not myself last night in the morning light I could see the change was showing
Like a child who was always poor reaching out for more I could feel the hunger growing
And as I lost control I swore I'd sell my soul for one love
Who would sing my song and fill this emptiness inside me
One love who would sing my song and lay beside me while we'd

Dream a bit of style
We'd dream a bunch of friends
Dream each others smile
And dream it never ends

All my dreams are lost and I can't sleep
And sleep alone could ease my mind
All my tears have dried and I can't weep

Rest in peace, and dream, dream it never ends",Faust,1974

Often beautiful but never perfect

A sea of unresolved thoughts
My arms wrapped around thin air
Time rewinds all the faults
Remember the happiness shared

Together we were just
A reflection of the world
Often beautiful but never perfect

My memories hold the warmth of your touch
And I could never forget the place in my heart
Where your smile hides

",Reflection,2004
Paul Winter,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""
A common ground",Common Ground (Velho Sermao),1977

Paul Winter,"Rio que mora no mar
Sorrio pro meu Rio 
Que tem no seu mar
Lindas flores que nascem morenas
Em jardins de sol

Rio, serras de veludo
Sorrio pro meu Rio
Que sorri de tudo
Que é dourado quase todo dia
E alegre como a luz

Rio é mar, eterno se fazer amar
O meu Rio é lua
Amiga branca e nua
É sol, é sal, é sul
São mãos se descobrindo em todo azul
Por isso é que meu Rio da mulher beleza
Acaba num instante com qualquer tristeza
Meu Rio que não dorme porque não se cansa
Meu Rio que balança

Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio",Rio,2001
Paul Winter,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

Paul Winter,"Coisa mais bonita é você
Assim, justinho você
Eu juro,eu não sei porque você

Você é mais bonita que a flor
Quem dera, a primavera da flor
Tivesse todo esse aroma
De beleza que é o amor

Perfumando a natureza
Numa forma de mulher
Porque tão linda assim não existe a flor
Nem mesmo a cor não existe

E o amor
Nem mesmo o amor existe
Porque tão linda assim não existe

A flor
Nem mesmo a cor não existe
E o amor

E podem mesmo falar mal, ficar de mal que não faz mal

Que eu não vou ir, melhor nem pedir, que eu não vou ir, não quero ir
E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu

Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez,2017
