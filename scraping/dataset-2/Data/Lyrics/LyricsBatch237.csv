Erk Alcrag,"I'm usually not one to speak out
But your decisions of late are on all accounts
Pretty fucked up
And not in a good way

And I heard about you and that Elli
If even half of it?s true then I'm not surprised that you've been
Kicking yourself to sleep

Oh, and who pulled who's hair on who's head
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did

Well, I heard about you and Elli
If even half of its true then I'm ashamed of you
And your sense of loyalty

Oh, and who found who's hair in who's bed?
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did

Oh, and who found who's hair in who's bed?
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did

Erk Alcrag,"Since the day I came to this world
I'm the so called fallen
I'm just a nail, nailed in the soul
Hurting their weak side

Collective thoughts of rage and aggression
My words defy their culture of fear
I'm a breathing offense for their nature
I know I'm fated to be against them

From all the pleasures my fave one comes
My loud laughter will be always heard
From all the pleasures my fave one comes
Hateful by nature, loathsome

I'm the incarnation of ancient rancors
Violent dreams of a once-caged bird
Stupid white men detest my roots
And I won't drown in my own blood
Look in my eyes, now you see clear
A contradiction that brings the tears
A wild impulse waits for it's time
I thank this anger for keeping me alive

I was born to be hated
'Cause I'll never be a part of their dirt
That's why I was born, was born to be hated
Offenses are vain, every word's the same
That's why I was born, was born to be hated
'Cause I represent just all that they fear
That's why

Chaos, all this is just vicious
I won't die for what a shithead says
Bastard pleasures
Legions living for obsession
Of those mad dogs licking ass
Bastard pleasures

Chaos, all this is just vicious
I won't die for what a shithead says
Bastard pleasures

Does this face offend you?
Does this skin offend you?
I hope they do 
'cause that's what I'm here for

I was born to be hated
'Cause I'll never be a part of their dirt
That's why I was born, was born to be hated
Offenses are vain, every word's the same
That's why I was born, was born to be hated
'Cause I represent just all that they fear
That's why I was born, was born to be hated
'Cause I'll never be a part of their dirt
That's why",Born to Be (Hated) [Original Odium],2004
Erk Alcrag,"Alguna vez te has enamorado
De alguien que no te correspondió
Eso no te impidió dejarlo de amar
O ser capaz de entenderlo o bien perdonarlo
Sólo era otra niña desubicada
Era sólo un alma perdida

Y tenía esa voz que, bueno temerosa
Era como si pudiera tomar todo el mal y toda la ira del mundo 
Y con solo una palabra elevarlos al cielo
Y yo, la ayude
Y le prometí que siempre estaría ahí

Para protegerla
Dime, ¿Qué es lo que crees?
En este mundo
En este mundo de intoxicados

Una voz que te enfurece
Hace eco en tus oídos alterados

Estás muriendo, ¿crees en ti?
Estás huyendo de algo vil
Violentos cambios sufres hoy
Brutal ausencia, ¿crees en ti hoy?

Sabes, ¿Estás viviendo o agonizando?

Sabes, ¿Estás viviendo o agonizando?
Y simplemente decides encarar
Lo que aborreces y quieres acabar
Y hasta ahora decides despreciar
Lo que te enferma y no puedes curar

Y simplemente decides encarar
Lo que aborreces y quieres acabar
Y hasta ahora decides despreciar
Lo que te enferma y no puedes curar

Y simplemente decides encarar
Lo que aborreces y quieres acabar
Y hasta ahora decides despreciar

Lo que te enferma y no puedes curar
No, no es lo que pasa por su mente sino lo que pasa por la mía
No puedo olvidar mi promesa
Es todo lo que me queda.

Dime, ¿Qué es lo que crees?
En este mundo de olvidados
Un grito que huye de ti
Hacia lugares ya abandonados

Estas muriendo, ¿Crees en ti?
Estás huyendo de algo vil
Violentos cambios sufres hoy
Brutal ausencia, crees en ti hoy?
Nada ni nadie podrá llevarse lo que sabes.
Nada ni nadie podrá llevarse lo que puedes ver.
Y simplemente decides encarar
Lo que aborreces y quieres acabar
Y hasta ahora decides despreciar
Lo que te enferma y no puedes curar
Y simplemente decides encarar
Lo que aborreces y quieres acabar
Y hasta ahora decides despreciar
Lo que te enferma y no puedes curar",Ecos,2004

And a team much stronger than yours,

Wave em side to side and keep their hands high

Erkan & Stefan,"When I woke up this morning I was feelin' fine
But this cat starts banging man what a swine.
So I called reception but to no avail
That's why I'm telling you this sorry tale.
It went bang, I said shut up

It went bang, I said rap up.
Well I'm aware that the guy must do his work
But the piledriver man drove me berserk.
He said captain
I said wot

He said captain
I said wot

He said captain

I said wot d'ya want

twice a day

I been to the west


But the girls I like best are the ones undressed.

Well
hello Adam
where you been?
I said a'stand aside 'cause I'm feelin' mean


I've had a gutful of you and I'm feelin' bad
'Cause you're an ugly old pirate and ain't I glad.

Erkan Aki,"Paese mio che stai sulla collina
Disteso come un vecchio addormentato
La noia l'abbandono il niente
Son la tua malattia

Paese mio ti lascio
Io vado via

Che sara, che sara, che sara
Che sara, della mia vita chi lo sa
So far tutto o forse niente da domani si vedra
E sara, sara quel che sara

Gli amici miei son quasi tutti via
E gli altri partiranno dopo me

Peccato
Perche stavo bene in loro compagnia
Ma tutto passa tutto se ne va

Che sara, che sara, che sara
Che sara, della mia vita chi lo sa
Con me porto la chitarra
E se la notte piangero
Una nenia di paese suonero

Amore mio ti bacio sulla bocca
Che fu la fonte del mio primo amore

Ti do appuntamento
Come quando non lo so

Ma so soltanto che ritornero.

Che sara, che sara, che sara
Che sara, della mia vita chi lo sa

Erkan Aki,"Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land find the place where all children grow
Every night after listening to this lullaby

There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way
Lead them back to the light back to the light
Where they once used to belong
Where they carry me children as long as they want

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land find the place where all children grow
Every night after listening to this lullaby
Every night after listening to this lullaby

Erkan Aki,"When I was young I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun 
Those days are gone
Livin' alone 
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone nobody's home
All by myself don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
Hard to be sure sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant 
And obscure remains the cure
All by myself don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself don't wanna live
All by myself anymore
When I was young I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun 
Those days are gone
All by myself don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself don't wanna live
Oh don't wanna live by myself, by myself
Anymore by myself anymore oh
All by myself don't wanna live
I never, never, never needed anyone",All by Myself,2005
Erlend Øye,"On a racecourse, there's a race to reach an end
Someone's calling the decathlon athlete's name
Further focus on the discipline applied
Or through constant shifts of exercise

Quatre cents mètres, saut à la perche,
Mille cinq mètres, cent mètres, saut en hauteur,
Lancer do javelot do poids et do disque,
Cent dix mètres haies, saut en longueur

There's a battle between the athlete and himself
And between him and the people there to help
Their incentive is for the pressure to conceive
The ignition of another level of reach

Do I want this?
Do I want this in my life?
Is it worth it?
Worth the sacrifice?",The Athlete,2003
Erlend Øye,"Every party's got a winner and a loser,
I'm jumping out of the game
By being a referee
Sometimes all I can do
Find a spot out of the light
Feel like a Japanese

Every party's got a winner and a loser,
Some girls are never alone
I'm always a little late
Each our own individual game plan
We ploy in order to stay
Out of the bottom half

Who's there with whom?
Who failed to show?
Who'll leave alone?

Since the birth of the very idea,
Way back in hellenical times
At the house of a bearded man
Every party's got a winner and a loser
One host who's gonna regret
Telling all they could feel like home
One Jew that no one invited
Three guys in love with one girl
Who takes hours to say goodbye",Every Party Has a Winner and a Loser,2003
Erlend Øye,"Crash on the highway,
Stranded between
My friends had waited,
But left without me
A glimpse on the platform,
We met on the train
She came from further,
Heading my way

Three days in April,
Three years ago
One black eyed stranger
I learned to know
Made all my plans stop
Shook me off track
Ten days of longing
I followed her back

A plane made of paper
Struck by the light
Circled forever
Over the city at night
Like a movie,
Like a song,
How it should be
Being young",Ghost Trains,2003
Erlend Øye,"The line that curves and cracks
The wall in two and points
To where your hand is stretched

My baby, you're everything to me
When you're gone, there's no one,
I'm just lonely
My baby, I never use those words,
But that's all I could call
Someone as sweet as you

Here and now
The air the light
Has burst into between
Where you and I
We rest unfold
And melt like gold",Like Gold,2003
Erlend Øye,"I was looking for a woman to be good to me
I was with the other people and they had to eat
I couldn't go alone, I didn't know my way
Don't know the language, so I had to stay
Woke up in the morning with a job to do
Twenty seconds later got stuck in the queue
When in Rome they're digging to extend the lines,
They're running into ruins, gotta stop all the time
Went upon a hill to get a view of the town,
Didn't really happen 'cause the clouds were down
Brought a CD player to be checking our song,
Didn't do recordables we moved along
To an elevated garden overlooking the street
She was standing with a spinett at the side of her feet.
Shouted to her promising to make her a star
She didn't have the time and she left in a car

Prego amore vieni con me.

Waiting for a DJ, but he never turned up
Figured that he didn't 'cause he knew he would suck
I was sitting in the rhythm backing the beat
Couldn't see her dancing back on the street
Just because you got the magic happening then
Doesn't make it certain it'll happen again
Just because you know someone is looking for you
Doesn't have a say in who they're running into",Prego Amore,2003
Erlend Øye,"Brave girl replies
When you come back, I'll be gone
Read off her rules,
When in control I move on
Thoughtful or sad,
No need to ask

You in her eyes a sister someone
Who's been where
She's roaming now
Flashes of home
And people there
Pressured caught up she feels,
Measured all up revealed

I still haven't walked my distance
I'm not ready to return

Independent on my way to become I

Sunday no sign,
Why did I meke you meet me here?
No cause for doubt,
But feeling sustains
When mix up clears
Easy and loose,
Unsure confused

It doesn't take much to knock me
I've been living a sheltered life",Sheltered Life,2003
Erlend Øye,"A sudden rush of expectation
As I realise it's you
Like a river in a droughtful season
How cool you didn't call
Initial hint of disappointment
The mirror of my smile
That isn't there, that doesn't follow
A very causal 'hi'

Why did you come at all,
If it wasn't for me?
Another blow of resignation
When realise I do

Now in your hands
The book you borrowed
The whole way we first met
Comes together in my head,
When the picture's clear you've left",Sudden Rush,2003
Erlend Øye,"What you kept saying
And what I was told
Never related,
So I don't know,
Maybe tomorrow
Or Wednesday,
But I'll find excuses
To wait, wait, wait

The only date that's certain,
The wedding of our friends,
I think it's for the better,
I keep my cool till then
One out of many
Not how it feels,
But how I'll think of you
At the end of the year

I don't know what's happening to me
Is it a symptom of disease?

Wish I could tell you
About the distance between
How my life is unfolding and
How I thought it would be
Wish you were someone
With whom I could share what I find
In the people and places
In this new world of mine",Symptom of Disease,2003
Erlend Øye,"And so I'm back and I am stuck here in the same room
A thorough shuffle to the mail my first excuse
Not to immediately face the day's agenda
Some very awkward words I need be telling you

of a feeling that in motion through I've carried
For it to be worn off upon return
That grew inside me like a credit taken
In a currency I could no longer earn

No better way,
No other time,
No other call,
No better line,
As soon as now, within your room
It can't go on
I'm not in love with you

My mouth has got a funny taste of metal,
A pencil line's been drawn upon my face
Weight has come to hang around my shoulders
For the knowledge of a doubt I can't erase

Hey boy you never finish what you've started
Says the man I wanna be who I am not
Who will sacrifice his part as easy lover
To never be the one who holds and drops",The Talk,2003
Erlend Øye,"AH unexpected, sight, wide 
AH hard, solid, pick-up

Erles Jones,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,1998
Erles Jones,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night,1998
Erles Jones,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young,1998
"Erling Aksdal, Jr.","You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing

Erly Thornton,"Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Only blue talk and love
Remember the true love we share today

Erma Franklin,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down
Spinning so fast, but for some it just ends
Keep moving on quiet as kept
It hasn’t been long, hasn’t sunken in yet

Then I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
Separate like a puzzle floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life
So lost

There’s so many things we haven’t said
There’s so many places never went
Wish you could visit every now and then
Oh I keep pretending like I understand
Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone
So lost

Cause I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
Never seeing you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life

So I rise and fall like the tide
And I’m so full and empty inside
All those memories linger in my mind

29 bambini e la maestra Margherita
Tutti mi chiedevano in coro

Io la stringevo per portarti via di là

Hai smesso di sognare per farmi sognare

E ricorda che l’amore non colpisce in faccia mai
Figlio mio ricorda
L’uomo che tu diventerai 
Non sarà mai più grande dell’amore che dai
Non ho dimenticato l’istante 
In cui mi sono fatto grande
Per difenderti da quelle mani
Anche se portavo i pantaloncini 
La tua collana con la pietra magica
Io la stringevo per portarti via di là 
Ma la magia era finita
Restava solo da prendere a morsi la vita

Ermal Meta,"Smetto di contare i giorni, sono come stelle che non stanno su 
Che se sono un po' importanti contano e nemmeno le conti più 
Aquiloni senza cielo 
Ma anche essendoci davvero 

Dicono che questa vita è una lunga corsa e il resto non si sa 
C'è chi lascia tutti indietro 
Chissà poi se il fiato gli basterà 
Ma alla fine ciò che conta è l'amore 
Che ci resta 

Se ci fosse anche per me 
Una carezza per ogni mio errore 
Avrei un cuore bellissimo, sì, senza un graffio e senza paure 
Ma l'amore che spacca le ossa non lascia ferita 

Tutto il nostro costruire è una candela accesa fra me e te 
E bisogna averne cura perché questo mondo la può spegnere 
Se per caso ti stancassi e ciò che abbiamo non bastasse mai 
Ti risponderei che il pane anche se è vecchio non si butta e lo sai 

Se ci fosse anche per me 
Una carezza per ogni mio errore 
Avrei un cuore bellissimo, sì, senza un graffio e senza nemmeno paure 
Ma l'amore che spacca le ossa non lascia ferita 
E ti ripaga per tutte le volte che hai perso la strada 

E se ci provi a pensare e non è poi così male 
E c'è poco in fondo da capire 
E io che provo a spiegare cosa muove le cose 
Ma l'ossigeno non è respirare 
Non hai un cuore bellissimo, sì 
L'hai consumato di gioia ma ne è valsa la pena
E l'amore che spacca le ossa 
Non lascia nessuna ferita 

L'amore che ci resta 
Che ci resta 
E l'amore che spacca le ossa non lascia nessuna ferita 
E la strada che faccio stasera per tornare a casa 

Tutto quello che ci resta è una candela accesa fra me e te",Quello che ci resta,2018
Ermal Meta,"Andare avanti e poi tornare 
Al punto di partenza 
Per poi ricominciare la mia corsa senza meta 
È così che amo fare 
Per la voglia di non perdermi più niente del percorso 
Nella gara della vita 
Dove correre non basta 
Devi andare più veloce 
E spesso c'è da perdere amicizie e falsi amori 
Ma rientra nella norma 
Mi ci sono abituato 
Mi basta sapere che 

Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 
Per gonfiare le mie vele 
Navigare in mari sconosciuti 
Io non ho perso tempo 
A volte ho perso me 
Per poi ritrovarmi e ripartire 
Ancora verso te 
Ancora verso te

Cadere, rialzarsi e poi sognare 
Tornare a farsi male 
È il prezzo da pagare per stare bene 
E mi faccio forza 
Ogni maledetta volta 
Ma non è solo fortuna 
Anzi è una gran fatica 
E gli ostacoli son tanti 
Mi ci sono abituato 
Mi basta sapere che 

Io non ho perso tempo 
Ho preso vento 
Per gonfiare le mie vele 
Navigare in mari sconosciuti 
Io non ho perso tempo 
A volte ho perso me 
Per poi ritrovarmi e ripartire 
Ancora verso te 

Parlare, sono stanco di parlare 
Con la gente che crede di sapere quale sia la direzione 
Ma non ascolta una parola, mi ci sono abituato 

Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 
Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 
Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 
Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 
Io non ho perso tempo, ho preso vento 

Per gonfiare le mie vele 
Navigare in mari sconosciuti 
E non ho perso tempo 
A volte ho perso me 
Per poi ritrovarmi e ripartire 
Ancora verso te 
Ancora verso te 
Ancora verso te 
Oh ancora verso te
Ancora verso te

Andare avanti e poi tornare

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there

Don't let her know that she's getting through with you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two

Everyday our love's a battle royal
Dear, it seems that fighting's all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you
You'll do things to me you shouldn't do so

And walk this lovely land with me

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I said, ""Baby, it's scary

Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Held you close, but, baby ? couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvin's
And we swore we'd be best friends

Ernest Ranglin,"I see faces in the sky of sad forgotten souls
Low down decaying joy no hope to keep me whole
No breeze to comfort me no love to save my mood
Sunlight burns into me I'm branded solitude

How many times can I ignore
That devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

Too many thoughts demanding what I'm meant to do
Too many pains of old call out the pains of new
I squeeze my head so hard to force the demons out
Dark angels laugh at me and all that I'm about


How many times can I ignore
That devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

I can't go on
I hate my self
I can't let go
Of what I am

A poisoned mind corrupts the fabric of my soul
I rip apart the script but still I play the role",What I Am,2005

Looked out the window and it's pouring down the rain

Don't ever leave me again""

Ain't nothin' on earth, I wouldn't do for you
And I cry, ""Baby, oh, baby

And I start calling
Oh baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'

Tell me that you're mine till the end of time

And I cry, ""Baby, oh, baby

But since that time sweetheart I find there's been an awful change
The love I knew has proved untrue and now we're far apart
No matter how you treat me now you'll still be in my heart
I understand your many plans I brought you wealth and pride
With all your gold when love is cold you'll be dis-satisfied
You were untrue because you knew I love you from the start
Though you'll find bliss in another's kiss you'll still be in my heart

I can't erase the lovely face no matter how I try
When friends we knew just mention you I hang my head and cry
You turned me down because you found you play the leadin' part

On that sad day beneath the clay to sleep forever more
Should you be there in deep despair when burning teardrops start

I saw your face in this rainbow and it made me think of our love
We'll build our home in the country and make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven sweetheart just for we two

We'll move to the land of the rainbow and live in the stary blue",Rainbow at Midnight,1989
Ernest Tubb,"[Chorus]
I'm on my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico
Riding on a tanker, and feeling mighty low
My good gal's behind me, no lovin' for so long
I'm going back to Texas, cause that's where I belong

Nights are so lonely on the ocean
There's to much time to dream of yesterday
If only I could only carry out my notion
Id hit the trail for Texas right away

I never thought when I was leavin'
I could get so blue out on the sea
But It'll bet you after all this grieving
It's that good old Texas soil for me

Ernest Tubb,"When the postman delivered a letter
It filled her dear heart full of joy
But she didn't know till she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
Dear Mom, was the way that it started
I miss you so much it went on
Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darling had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free",Soldier's Last Letter,1989

And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here see sweet thang I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
Cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I want to tell all you barroom roses if my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes

I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little she don't know that I got
Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot

But broken dreams and shattered schemes
With each new day's dawning I try to pretend one more tomorrow and waiting will end
I'm waiting for ships that never come in I wonder where they can be
Now life is only a game of poker and happiness is the pot
They'd deal you five cards in the cradle and you play with your like it or not
Some game had a start with and the game doesn't seem on the square
When you pick up your cards and discover that you were born without even a pair
Now some take a chance on bluffing and stake everything they've got
On a little yankee poor flush and sometimes that wins a plot
While others will break up openers to draw for a middle straight
Why they know the chance they are taking but they learned your mistake too late
Now some can't plan crook it against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it at the end they've paid the price
Now me I've always been a loser why it seems I never can win

When their glamour starts to bore you come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown pick me up on your way down

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

And their love that was more than 
The clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam of their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy 
And I'd love to go tagging along
Holding hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing her his song

That great Titanic began to reel and rock 
Then the people began to cry

The rich they declared that they would not ride with the poor 
So they sent the poor below 
They were the first to go

There's alot of things I want, a lot of things that I'd like to be.
But girl, I don't forsee  a rags-to-riches story for me.
There's just one little dream I've got to come true;
There's just one round I've gotta win,
I can't be a loser with you.

Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
Cause I couldn't face a day if you weren't here by my side.
If you went away then I'd be left without any pride.
I've given up on schemes, 'Cause all of them fell through,
I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.

Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find,
But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind.
I can't give you the world, But I I'll work hard for you, girl.
I'll work hard, ev'ryday, all my life.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Bruised by the city, bewildered, betrayed 
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides 
I have come to the bridge, to the line that divides! 

What am I doing up here in a daze 
As I gaze at the cold river bed? 
Why do I ask myself, ""Shall I go back 
when I seem to be going ahead?"" 

To black moonlight! 
Where everything reflects your colour 
Darkness that is endless. 
nights that leave me friendless . . . blue! 

Black moonlight! 
You make the lights of Harlem duller 
Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded . . . too! 
Why must you send . . . 
ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing . . . 
like shadows of love that are gone? 

Where will it end? 
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight 
and darken each promise of dawn?

Madly, I await you, even though I hate you

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go

That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Telling people what I've found

And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see
And when I tell them
And I certainly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me

Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been; well, who can say?
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said ""yes""
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

And when I told them how wonderful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your curly hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest thing that one could see
And when I tell them
And I certainly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the girl whose boy one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me",They Didn't Believe Me,1997
Ernestine Anderson,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Ernestine Anderson,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
Just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
It's a duty that we owe to dear old France.
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic?,1998
Ernestine Anderson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1998
Ernestine Anderson,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1998
Ernestine Anderson,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship,1998
Ernestine Anderson,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings

Never were, really are, nearly are?

In mezzo al fuoco ognuno vuol salvarsi quando in tanti si può spegnere l'incendio

Sto correndo come certi velocisti
Sono in fila insieme a santi ed arrivisti
E imbecilli come gli antivaccinisti

Pensavo di essere morto un'altra volta, un'altra volta, un'altra volta

Mi stringo le palle, non so se duro fino a domani

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

There's someone around me just a step behind
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in

Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
There's one guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take

But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug
Life is a riddle and I'm really stumped

If you reason, don't you know

I think I'm being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

Baby all you get is two snaps up and the finger
 
The bob-a-loo bad boy a threat to the paranoid
You try to step to this? it's void
A new hit from the grand man with nights like the sandman
Gain for awake in case I gotta stomp a head out
 
Busted is a trick that's not up my sleeve
It's possessed with finesse and it works when I breathe
Paid in the shade with an a that's the grade
With the papers that I made from this trade

I'll walk with joy to know my debts are paid.
I know my name is clear before my Father; 
I am His child and I am not afraid.
So, greatly pardoned, I'll forgive my brother;
The law of love I gladly will obey.

I then shall live as one who's learned compassion.
I've been so loved, that I'll risk loving too.
I know how fear builds walls instead of bridges;
I'll dare to see another's point of view.
And when relationships demand commitment,
Then I'll be there to care and follow through.

Your Kingdom come around and through and in me;
Your power and glory, let them shine through me.

And may Your living Kingdom come in me.

And may You feed a hungry world through me.

After I told her goodbye
How do I love her so desperately

How do I ask her, to see me again
I told her I wasn't sure, we can be friends

Can you tell her everything that I said
Everything that I said
Oh oo hmm

How do I try explain everything
Nothing I said seems to (fade/fake)
Oh no
How do I get her to pick up the phone

Tell me what kind of man, lets love slips away
And leave such a good thing behind
Hold in my hand (lalala)
Praying to find, a way to fill in this hole I have inside

Count on me and I can count on you
What I feel for you comes deep within
When it comes to you count me in

I wish you weren't so far away

Like southern california misses rain

Let me guide your hand
Let me be your shelter

And the wind and waves keep pushing you down
Feel the whole world pulling you around

Let me guide your hand
Let me be your shelter
For you...for you I stand

And the moon and stars don't lead you nowhere

And boys secretly fantasize
Who me? I am just mesmerized by your every word and movement

You are close as a girl can be to ideal
Somehow you disagree
The whole world sees perfection
But all you see is room for more improvement

Chorus:
Silly girl, pretty girl
Do you not see?
What a spell your sweet love has cast on me
Girl I pray it never will
This trance be broken

I melt in your mouth when you talk to me
I want to kiss you so slow so sweet
You are a book that I want to read
Embrace cover to cover

Girl you?re so deep inside
You?re my DNA
You?re how tall I am
You?re how much I weigh
You?re the reason that someone had penned the phrase 
To know her is to love her
And I love her

Every pose you strike is from some magazine

Hearing guitars like someone in love.

Things I was thinking of.

'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1993

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1993

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,

I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low, 
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.",He'll Have to Go [#],1987
Ernie Newton,"I'd like to be the picture on your mantel 
I'd like to be the window in your door
I'd like to be the feather on your pillow 
I'd even like to be the carpet on your floor
I'd like to be the star outside your window 
That lucky chair that holds you every night
The puppy pop you warm up every morning 
I'd even like to be the apple that you bite
And if you need someone to talk with 
I'd like to be the little voice inside
And if you'll ever have a heartache 
I want to be the tear you hide
I'd like to the be the record on your phonograph 
The melody that action night and day
And when you're old enough to want to marry
I'd like to be the one who steals your heart away

And if you need someone to talk with...",I'd Like to Be [#],1987
Ernie Newton,"On a mountain stands a mansion so fine and it looks down on this cabin of mine
I had a love and I loved her true but along came a rich man and loved her to
Now on a mountain in a mansion stands my love

Well he promised he'd buy her diamond rings yes he promised fancy dresses and things
He promised everything indeed but it can't buy the love that her poor heart needs
On a mountain in a mansion so fine
[ guitar ]
Now I know that she's not happy there and I know that she's got thing to bare
My only dream is that someday she'll come right back here and stay
In the cabin in the valley with me

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty, baby
