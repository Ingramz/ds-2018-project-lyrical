Simon,"I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying 

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mr. City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the eggman 
(""How do you do sir"")
They are the eggmen 
(""The man maintains a fortune"")
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob Goo Goo Goo g' joob

Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you
(Ho ho ho hee hee hee hah hah hah)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking
Edgar Allen Poe

I am the eggman

Simon,"Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home

Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place

Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees

誰かと被れば無くなる style
飛んじまったヤツ 消えてくヤツの

Simon &  Milo,"Julie wants to get out of town
She needs to settle down
Move to a place where no one knows her

Lisa just had to get away
Nothing could make her stay
Tired of living under cover

Everybody knows somebody
Trying to get free

Be as white as you want to
Be as black as you want to
Be as brown as you want to
Don't let anybody stop you

Be as straight as you want to
Be as gay as you want to
You can wait if you want to
We all need something to hold on to

And if there is a way
That you and I could both be free
Have a little understanding
And we'll be

Daniel moved to another school
Alliances can be cruel
When you're alone without nobody

Michael begged Jen to take a stand
And fight for the love they had
But she'd rather deal with being lonely

Everybody's got somebody
Telling them what to be

Be as white as you want to
Be as black as you want to
Be as brown as you want to
Don't let anybody stop you

Be as straight as you want to
Be as gay as you want to

Be as shy as you want to
Be as loud as you want to
Be as small as you want to

Be as thin as you want to
Be as fat as you want to
Be as short as you want to

I recall the way that Stephanie said to me callously
It's not me, it's you
And I remember just how Julianne held my hand headline ran
It's not me, it's you

Seems the old equation's holding true one from two
Equals blue and nice guy's always lose

First we're stuck like glue
Then you say we're through
All that you can tell me is that
It's not me it's you

Hey, it's not me it's you

I can see the day that Minnie-Mae walked away heard her say
It's not me, it's you
And how could I forget how Caroline's name was signed dotted line
It's not me, it's you

Share the blame I do
Relationships take two
But all that you can tell me is that

I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

She is my lover
From the heart of Africa
Like no other
Princess of Nigeria
I was delirious
Ya that sun was beating down
Lady mysterious
Like an oasis that I found

And then she smiled
And then she came
And when she spoke
She told me her name

Omobolasire
I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

Short cut through Lagos
Through the market place together
Was getting serious
I could have stayed that way forever

As fate dictated
I had to go back home to London
My heart vibrated
Because I knew I had to get to you

Omobolasire
I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

Then came that sad day
A flight from Heathrow back to Lagos
Desperate to see ya
But they would not let me through

What can I do?
'Cept write to you
And everyday
My letters will say

Omobolasire
I really wanna see ya

I got your email
Disgruntled female
Every detail
Before my eyes

So I responded
I think we bonded
We corresponded
And watched the sunrise

Then you came through the screen
And you taught me the meaning of happiness
And the words that you write
Came and filled up my night with your tenderness

And if you're ever so inclined
Here's where you can find me

(www.)
I won't believe it

Until I read it
My heart is tied up in a knot
You know it's true

You made it clear to me
Described your fear to me
Of getting near to me
And risking our friendship

I stayed up all night
Construction website
Just click on our fight
And watch me crying

'Cause you said you were scared
And should probably stick to the Internet
And it hurts because deep down inside
I believe we are more than friends

And if you ever change your mind
Here's where you can find me

Simon & Garfunkel,"He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twenty-three years old the day he died

Freedom writer
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home outsider
This town's gonna be your buryin' place

He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong

He was my brother

Simon & Garfunkel,"Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit.
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows.
Blessed are the sat upon, Spat upon, Ratted on,
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?
I got no place to go,
I've walked around Soho for the last night or so.
Ah, but it doesn't matter, no.

Blessed is the land and the kingdom.
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to.
Blessed are the meth drinkers, Pot sellers, Illusion dwellers.
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?
My words trickle down, like a wound
That I have no intention to heal.

Blessed are the stained glass, window pane glass.
Blessed is the church service makes me nervous
Blessed are the penny rookers, Cheap hookers, Groovy lookers.

I have tended my own garden
Much too long.",Blessed,1966
Simon & Garfunkel,"Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I don't know what is real
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

No matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall",Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall,1966
Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
But I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",I Am a Rock,1966
Simon & Garfunkel,"The night sets softly with the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies
And the pattern never alters until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should, for in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled

",Patterns [#][*][Demo Version],1966
Simon & Garfunkel,"It was in the merry month of May
When green bugs were a-swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For the love of Barbriallen

He sent his servant to the town
The place where she'd been dwelling
Say master dear has sent me here
If your name be Barbriallen

And slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you are dying""

Oh, don't you remember the other day
When we where in a tavern?
You drank, your health to the ladies there
And you slided Barbriallen

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
Adieu, adieu to all my friends
Be kind to Barbriallen

She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-coming
""Oh, put him down for me"", she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked, the more she grieved
She busted out in crying
Oh, pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dying

They buried sweet Willy in the old church yard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willy's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and they grew on the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they tied in a true love's knot
The rose bush and the briar",Barbriallen [#][*][Demo Version],1966

Pressed in organdy;
Clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy;
Softer than the rain.

Down past the shop displays.
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways,
As I walked on.

Your cheeks flushed with the night.
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight,

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie

Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me

And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down

Simon & Garfunkel,"This is the early evening edition of the news.
The recent fight in the House of Representatives was over the open housing
  section of the Civil Rights Bill.
Brought traditional enemies together but it left the defenders of the
  measure without the votes of their strongest supporters.
President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination
  by everyone for every type of housing but it had no chance from the start
  and everyone in Congress knew it.
A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee.
In Los Angeles today comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an
  overdoes of narcotics.
Bruce was 42 years old.
Dr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open
  housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero.
Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call off the march and the
  police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out
  if it is held.
King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago Tuesday.
In Chicago Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought
  before a grand jury today for indictment.
The nurses were found stabbed an strangled in their Chicago apartment.
In Washington the atmosphere was tense today as a special subcommittee of the
  House Committee on Un-American activities continued its probe into anti-
  Viet nam war protests.
Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting
  anti-war slogans.
Former Vice-President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial
  increase in the present war effort in Viet nam, the U.S. should look forward
  to five more years of war.
In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York,
  Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single
  weapon working against the U.S.
That's the 7 o'clock edition of the news,

Of a now-late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room

And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference, like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with book markers
That measure what we've lost

Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""

And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand

And kiss you when you start your day

Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs

Weave their weary paths and die

The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising

And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht!

And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,

He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch,
And they were grateful for his patronage and thanked him very much,

A boy sat on the ledge.
An old man who had fainted was revived.
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed
If the boy survived.

""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother.

The woman from the supermarket
Ran to call the cops.
""He must be high on something,"" someone said.
Though it never made The New York Times.
In The Daily News, the caption read,
""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother.

A patrol car passing by
Halted to a stop.
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:
""The force can't do a decent job
'Cause the kids got no respect
For the law today (and blah blah blah).""

""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother.
""What's becoming of the children?""

When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd
And made them wild
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.
When the spotlight hit the boy,
The crowd began to cheer,
He flew away.

People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""

I'm feeling alright with my boys and with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah

Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I remember playin' some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a J
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up louder to get away

It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away

That's what Mrs. Riordan said and she should know;
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man.

He was a most peculiar man.
He lived all alone within a house,
Within a room, within himself,
A most peculiar man.

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him,
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them.
Oh, no! he was a most peculiar man.

He died last Saturday.
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room;
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon.

God keeps his eye on us all

Flying my bike past the gates of the factories
My mom doing the laundry
Hanging out shirts in the dirty breeze
And after it rains there's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there
It's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same back in my little town

My little town, my little town

Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town

I never meant nothing, I was just my father's son, hmm-hmm

Dreamin' of glory
Twitching like a finger on a trigger of a gun

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset

Down past the shop displays 
I heard cathedral bells 
Tripping down the alleyways

Your cheeks flushed with the night 
We walked on frosted fields 
Of juniper and lamplight

And when I woke

I kissed your honey hair

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence [Single Version],2000

Simon & Garfunkel,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start your day

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

So you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I

I held her close, but she faded in the night

Simon & Garfunkel,"He was a most peculiar man.
That's what Mrs. Riordan said and she should know;
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man.

He was a most peculiar man.
He lived all alone within a house,
Within a room, within himself,
A most peculiar man.

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him,
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them.
Oh, no! he was a most peculiar man.

He died last Saturday.
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room;
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon.
And all the people said, ""What a shame that he's dead,
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?""",A Most Peculiar Man [Live],2003

Near the flowers.

We might as well be apart.
It hardly matters,
We sleep separately.

And drop a smile passing in the hall
But there's no laughs left
'Cause we laughed them all.
And we laughed them all
In a very short time.

Is tapping on my forehead,
Hanging from my mirror,
Rattling the teacups,
And I wonder,
How long can I delay?

Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
Hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within it’s silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel’s stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night

It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw

I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera

People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

Disturb the sound of silence

Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine",That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,2007

You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones

I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?

Yes I would, if I could, I surely would

Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would",El Condor Pasa [If I Could],2008

Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night, ooh",A Poem on the Underground Wall [Demo],
Simon & Garfunkel,"I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Silently for me.",Homeward Bound [Live],2014
Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sounds of Silence,2014

Simon & Garfunkel,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl

Simon & Garfunkel,"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike

When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness comes

Simon & Garfunkel,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And as a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I",Kathy's Song [Album Version] [Version],2018

Simon Dawes,"Friendship makes me sick
It's the party that won't quit
And poor Laura's stuck outside
Where all the suckers think it's always nice

Scenesters know just where to hide
And they know what you don't like
Crazy Laura doesn't care
She's not impressed with me much anywhere

I think it's the drinkin' that I like
And how she never looks me in the eye
The cigarettes that help me hear her breathing
When she is sleeping by my side
The cut she gets from carrying a knife
The name she likes to say instead of mine
The way she won't say bye when she is leaving
Keeps her always on my mind

Be aware this is enough
Just to know these kids are drunk
And Laura taught me to stay quiet
You can't help anyone who don't know why

I'm much more ugly than you think
But it's hard this time of week
And crazy Laura doesn't care
She's not impressed with me much anywhere

I think it's the drinking that I like
And how she never looks me in the eye
The cigarettes that help me hear her breathing
When she is sleeping by my side
The cut she gets from carrying a knife
The name she likes to say instead of mine
The way she won't say bye when she is leaving
Keeps me thinking through the day
Of all her crooked ways",All Her Crooked Ways,2006
Simon Dawes,"Seven men in a dust bin congress
Standing in a row for final harvest
There's a swinging motion to their shadows
As if the sun above was a pocket watch

Sparrows diving in the whirlwinds arriving
Playing games with floating dead flowers revolving
Those little white darlings like the hard snow falling
On someone just standing over what they've caught

There's always been a deep six waiting right below you
Every time you thought you had tomorrow to wake up to
Now you shut your eyes, don't hold your tears back
As your head gets a hold of what they're giving you
And your legs start folding in twelve different places

And up and down your back you feel the spectators' faces
Hear your slow counting in three slow paces
And your brain shows you pictures of wide open spaces
Where you once shot the rifle your grandfather gave you
At a brand new white wooden water tower

But don't come to me and cry 'May Day'
'Cause it doesn't work that way
But don't come to me and cry  'May Day'
'Cause it doesn't work that way

I'm sure you didn't get a chance to see it
But those scruffy boys from our country pockets
Had a mean case of jitters that could
Shake the name off God above

And this is where you learn to talk in secrets
Where the guilt's so dry and the sweat is helpless
When they say, ""You know this is for what he did""
But it just isn't good enough

Well, I've seen karma and his ball dropping
I've seen life and its clever ways of stopping
I've seen people chase dreams until the dream's forgotten
And I've seen a killer with a heavy heart

When the trigger can just be made of plastic
And the blood can just be something that ruined the fabric
On the uniform that you could just burn with matches
But your eyes fall shut as reality disquiets

And you finally know that what has happened today
Is going to be a part of you
And this better be a big pay day
But it doesn't look that way

Nervous tension

Nervous tension
Is an unseen enemy of the human mind
Nervous tension can cause you
To lack confidence in yourself
To lose your concentration
And to be inefficient in your work

Nervous tension can prevent you from relaxing
To spoil your leisure hours
And rob you of the sleep you need at night
Nervous tension

Nervous tension

The purpose of this record
Is to train you in the art of relaxing
Both your mind and your body
Use it regularly

Train your mind through repetition
To follow the suggestions
And then you'll be ready to progress
To side two

The mind remains tense
When it is restlessly
Turning over personal problems
Worrying about financial matters

Or the conflicts of daytime plight
Or fretting over the troubles of the world
A mind so strained and tense
Cannot relax even in sleep

Night passes in uneasy dreams
The body is not refreshed as it should be
But you can overcome this difficulty
If you thoroughly relax your mind
Before you go to bed

Better still, you can learn to relax
From time to time during the day
So that nervous tension never builds up
To an unpleasant degree

Nervous tension
Nervous tension

You will carefully plan your course through life
You will think about your plan
Think about your interests
Think with the pleasure
Of the satisfaction you will feel

As the plan becomes reality
You will firmly imprint in your mind this phrase
""I maintain, at all times
A calm, confident, cheerful state of mind""
You will repeat it aloud to yourself
At least three times daily

You will give your mind and body
The rest they need to restore energy
Very shortly you will no longer
Need to listen to my voice

You will absorb and understand
The suggestions I have given you
And you will learn to give them to yourself

To have my body buried

That I wouldn't harm her

Kept still by her eyes

Through glass blew the winter
And I kept to her side
And to warm her I cried hot tears, hot tears

when the season did turn
I turned to the highway
And I broke my promise 
I left for the mountains

but the forest did burn
And fell toward the ocean
Drenched and alone 
I swam through my own hot tears
Hot tears.

for love is richer
Than either mountain or ocean
So hold onto her dreams
While you still know them

the pastures are a plenty

Simon Joyner,"When your heart aches 
Like it was left out in the rain.
Your fingers feel frozen &fake
From touching cold, dishonest things. 
You musn't worry about the time,
It floats in air brine. 
I just drink it like it's wine, anyway. 

If yr lost, you can call me.
You can call me, &i will find you.
I will find you, today. 

when your day ends 
The morning seems so far away.
All your close closet friends leave
Only perfume or smoke in their place.
You musn't worry about the time,
It floats in air &brine. 
&i just drink it like it's wine, anyway.

If yr lost, you can call me.
You can call me, &i will find you.
I will find you, today. 

The spider writes a letter 
To the fly caught in his web,
The fly feels a whole lot better 
&goes back to bed. 
Never to wake, 
I think he made a big mistake. 
So you musn't worry about the time,
It floats in air &brine.
I'll just drink it like it's wine, anyway.

You can call me, &i will find you. 
I will find you, I will find you.

Simon Joyner,"Alas, our love is gone
At least I don't where it is
I know I lost it in my song once
But I thought I found it in your kiss

So I went and had my skull cleaned
They gave me a suitcase for my rage
And a balloon to hold my steam
And a tightrope to embrace

Now I know how to live alone
In a crowd or in your arms
But I don't know how to be alive
In the mirror or at your side

""It's not so easy,"" said the rain
""You want the wound but not the pain
To be forgiven but not betrayed
To stand naked and unashamed
It's not so easy,"" said the rain

Don't say a word
Give me your hunger and your pride
I'll give you the song, the mockingbird
I'll give you the color of the sky",Blue,2004

And let the marble night withdraw 
You can smoke a cigarette on the wooden steps 
The mosquitos are not vampires 
The moon is not your mother 
Even if she is preparing for a total eclipse 

Get behind the wheel 
Stay in front of the storm 
Get behind the wheel 
Stay in front of the storm 

The clouds they dream disorder 
They make faces they make mud 
On some ancient order which is no longer in force 

The sugar bowl is full of ants 
And your sister is a dumpy mess 
And you're cutting off your head to spite your shoulders

And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my return to Earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you
Let's see you'd be about 60 now,
And long dead by the time I return to Earth
My time held dreams were full of you,
As you were when I left;
Still underage

There is no choice between us,
If you had ever seen us,
You'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness
Something special of your own
Being a clone, I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen,
Has just been written by
Oh, another twenty telepathic men,
Word for word, it says:
""Oh, for the wings of any bird,
Other than a battery hen"".

But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey so did you
So why were you holding her hand
Is that the way we stand
Were you lying all the time
Was it just a game to you

[Chorus:]
But I m in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to, do you have to let it linger

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, but I was wrong

If you, if you could get by

And I wouldn't feel so used

Simon LeBon,"I take too long
To answer telephones
I take too long to type my name
And record messages
But my handwriting is excellent
In fact it's second to none, none

I just got in
From somewhere really good
They offered me the part of Bono
And a speaking role
With all the merchandise
And sunglasses
I could ever need, need

I drive round cities in a chariot
I get preferential treatment
At the Marriott but if the truth be told
I'm naked under all those clothes

I tell you what is on my mind
I only want to be
In your record collection
I only want to be
In your record collection
And I'll do anything it takes
Just to get there

My brain is buzzing
And the room is strange
Like the scene in trading places
At the stock exchange
I made a million overnight in '87
Now I'm living in my
Parking space, parking space

My teeth are bright
And my hair is clean
I wear Paco Rabanne
Like I was Charlie Sheen
But in the rain we all look wet
And in the snow we all look cold

[Chorus]

Disgusted by all the flashness
I think I'm a don
They think I'm an actor
But I catch this
My two needs
Are pillow and a mattress
Once I can fill up the space
With a famous actress
Give me a mil, I'll do a DJ set
I pull spikey with the green
Like a cactus
Show off, ego's high
You can't match this
Chauvinistic pig
Money man tactics

I'm not as clever
As I thought I was
It got pointed out to me
As I was tying the knot
And all I want to know is
How I got so far down, down

I'm not as lucky
As I thought I was
My luck ran out the other day
As I was crossing the road
Who would have thought
A truck like that

Could have caused so much

It's so light, the dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud

I'm locked up, your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

To rivers flowing 'yond the factory halls

I left a letter lying on the bed
From a man in need, it read

It's so hard to find
Well, well, well. 
Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

All of my friends don't comprehend me
Their kind of style it just offends me
I want to take 'em, I want to shake 'em
'Till they pay me some heed

Until you find the right connection

You know it's so hard, 
So, so, so, so
Well, well. 
Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

Who's going to give you real happiness?
Who's going to give you contentedness?
Who's going to lead you? Who's going to feed you?
And cut you free?
Well I've sailed every ship in the sea
But I traveled this world in misery

You know it's so hard, 
So hard, so hard
Well, well. 
Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

Well who's going to shoe your feet?
Ah who's going to pay your rent?
And who's going to stand by you?

Simon Nicol,"O who will remember, o who will be sure
And still feel the silence as close as before
And was there a season without any rain,
And never, o never, o never again?

Of the sadness of hiding, and the softness of sleep
O will there be nothing of peace â??till the end,
Or never, o never, o never again?

The time has come to travel 
But the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair
My youth has all been wasted 
And I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me 
Against my dying day
I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow,
You'll win the lover's prize

Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes

When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.

Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",1999

I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.

I've seen the man in the moon
I've seen things, I couldn't have dreamed of
I wished that you would come soon
And I know, when rainbow clouds open
I'll be the one on the moon
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

Should I stand back and watch
As you continue to argue all night
Maybe this is my role in life
But don't you worry yourself cause it's alright
If I knew what to say
Just like today when we were discussing the weather
I could want her amour
More of those days when we could be laughing together

It's time for quiet contemplation
Just like those men on the moon
No sense in thinking it over
Cause one and one should make
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

[Chorus]

If I kissed you like this
I know god exists
And what I was hoping to find here
Hold that thought in your head
If something I said
Could give you the wrong impression

So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

Running here and there all around the square
Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop
He only paused a moment when he heard them holler 'Stop!'

But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'

When will the cuts and scratches heal?
When does the price you pay to play outweigh the play?
Before your finger points to me

Remember ""Who inspired me""
And shove your fucking borrowed selfish identity

You'll fill it up till it bursts

Well, that's not totally true

Picking in the scabs from the past just gon' make it worse
Can't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse
When I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse
The good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first
All you needs just to believe that you can leave
Crown B and Es made me believe that I could lead
Righteous deeds, planting seeds for good society
So you see that I can't be totally new
'Cause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too
And nobody really knows what the future holds
All the future sends for our future souls
And what I am doing now I couldn't do before
What would you do, man, if you could go?

I know we both won't say a word

Simon Townshend,"There's on line
That each time said will capture you
As I pine in my wine
I may feel it's true
Said so easily but meant casually
At one time I said I'm in love with you
It's a fine way
To treat a lady I've just meet
Feeling is written in her eyes
With me just desperate
So sad as I plea but still running free
I might say that I may be in love with you
Maybe it's rough
But I'm feeling rough
I'm sorry for the plans you made
I'm sorry I just had you laid
I said sorry but I do think
Everything that you think
But I'm not the kind to stay
So I must say
Sorry for the hurt in you
I'm sorry for what I must do
I said sorry if I knew how
Everything would turn out
Sorry for those things I said
Just to get you in my bed
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
And to you I gave every drop I had
I woo you as you chew through
Hours ending sad
But in my way I'll mean it when I say
The one line that each time said
Will capture you
And I know it may seem tough
But I'm full of stuff
I said sorry for the plans you made
I'm sorry I just had you laid
I said sorry but I do think
Everything that you think
But I'm not the kind to stay
So I must say
Sorry for the hurt in you
So sorry for what I must do
I say sorry my burning loads me
Sorry my guilt explodes me
Sorry my heart erodes me
I'm sorry for those things I said
Just to get you in my bed
I'm sorry I'm sorry

Simon Townshend,"Looking in the mirror, what do I see but me?
Trying to forget her it was never meant to be
And that's not clever, cause she didn't mean a thing
The morning after what do I see, tell me what do I see
No wonder I feel wasted, I did it to myself
No wonder I've been losing sleep
With the company I keep
Looking in the mirror eyes blood shot and sore
Trying to remember was it me or was it her
Sitting in the traffic feeling such a fake
And all this panic cause I made a mistake, tell me what can I say
No wonder I feel cheated, I did it to myself
No wonder I've been losing sleep
No wonder I feel wasted

No wonder I've been losing sleep with the company I keep
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Need your company
Saw my reflection in the window of a store,
Got no price tag, I've been used and worn
And that's not clever 'cause she wasn't worth a damn
Now only my conscience knows who I am

The light is fading it's the end of the day, she's lying awake,
Wondering if tomorrow's gonna be her friend,
She's too young to understand but knows something's wrong,
Now mama has gone, and daddy's doing all that he can to recompense,

And out of these lonely days, she's trying to make the most,
This unfamiliar place, she's trying to make it home,
She's working hard to get the kind of love her mama gave, oh

Go to sleep my little baby,
(Go to sleep my little baby)
Go to sleep my little baby,
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay,
Don't leave nobody but the babe,


She takes the pressure and she hides it away,
Still wakes everyday, and always sets the table for an extra place,

This ain't what she chose, this is what she's got,
Hope that when she grows old, no one needs to pay the cost,

Trying to get around my fear of
When and where do I go from here

I asked somebody close to me
Who could see a lot further than a boy could see
Oh, oh, oh and he said

Oh my, oh my, oh my these days are flying by
I still feel seventeen inside, not one day over
Don't let the trials of life, change who you are tonight
Stay seventeen each time you get one year older

I said you're at that time of life when your heart is strong
Your future's bright, you can do no wrong
And don't you let those feelings out of sight
Keep a hold of them as the years go rolling by

These words have always stuck with me
But now I'm only getting what it all appears to mean

Oh my, oh my, oh my these days are flying by

Don't let the trials of life, change who you are tonight
Stay seventeen each time you get one year older

And I hope you live your life the way that I lived mine
Stay young at heart, stay young in mind

It's been a journey through the dark
I've lived the live that and no answers
The truth was always in my heart
I've spent a coin to make decisions
And still I always got it wrong
Try to AVOID HELD ON collision

So I say uh uh uh
That's the way it goes
I've lived to find another day
And I...uh uh uh uh uh

Play on...

It's like a story never told
It's like a night when your own fire
Why Goes the morning feel so cold?
Feels like I'm trapped inside a circle
AND though I plan my great escape
IT'S like come back AT where I've started
The only thing I have is space

Que seguiram a estrela guia
A bandeira segue em frente
Atrás de melhores dias, ai, ai

Que ele voltará de novo
Que o rei será bendito
Ele nascerá do povo, ai,ai",Bandeira Do Divino [Holy Flag Procession],1984
Simone,"Pode ir armando o coreto
E preparando aquele feijão preto
Eu tô voltando

Põe meia dúzia de Brahma pra gelar
Muda a roupa de cama
Eu tô voltando

Leva o chinelo pra sala de jantar
Que é lá mesmo que a mala eu vou largar
Quero te abraçar, pode se perfumar
Porque eu tô voltando

Dá uma geral, faz um bom defumador
Enche a casa de flor
Que eu tô voltando

Pega uma praia, aproveita, tá calor
Vai pegando uma cor
Que eu tô voltando

Faz um cabelo bonito pra eu notar
Que eu só quero mesmo é despentear
Quero te agarrar

Pode se preparar porque eu tô voltando
Põe pra tocar na vitrola aquele som
Estréia uma camisola, eu tô voltando

Dá folga pra empregada
Manda a criançada pra casa da avó
Que eu to voltando

Diz que eu só volto amanhã se alguém chamar
Telefone não deixa nem tocar
¡Quero lá, lá, lá, ia, porque eu to voltando!

Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo

Por eso a veces se que necesito

Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas

Renuncio a ver el sol cada mañana

My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever
letting all their love come through
My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space.
If all of everything about my love
fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too.
Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let It be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disinfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is
Pain all over
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know
Enough to say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free
Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain tap and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Til love's all over

Let it reach out to every heart
To every disinfranchised people
Till it is present and no more is
Pain all over

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spead love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea

Nada do que quero me suprime 
Do que por não saber ainda não quis

Faz se revelar

Diventasse il tormento ne dell'estate per la gente
Discoteche di Riccione, dentro ai ristoranti
Dalle radio nazionali e nei villaggi di vacanze

L'ombrellone te lo ficco nel culo
E il gelato te lo spiaccico in faccia
Questa sabbia te la tiro negli occhi
E poi ti prendo a calci lungo la spiaggia
Con la sdraio ti ci spezzo la schiena
E ci piscio sulla tua abbronzatura
Ora ingurgita la crema solare
Prima che ti affoghi in questo schifo di mare

Sto pensando seriamente di scapparmene in montagna
La mia musica sarà soltanto un asino che raglia
Nella pace dei sensi, praticando un po' di yoga
Scoprirò la vera essenza che si cela in ogni cosa
Ma ripenso a questo pezzo e ad un balletto da abbinare
Quattro passi, due tre mosse, anche un orso le sa fare
Così tutti quanti poi si sentiranno più felici
Solo un po' più stronzi, ma lontani ormai dai loro uffici

Simone Dinnerstein,"I'll tell you what I will miss 
California and horses,
Down by the sailboats where we waded in,
The feel of the world in my hands, in my hands,
The feel of the world in my hands.

And still so many ways that I love the wind 
From a storm in the sails to the breath on your lips,
It's such a little thing, then again, then again,
The feel of the world in your hands, in your hands,
The feel of the world in your hands, in your hands.

Just like the Sunday we drove out from Houston,
Out to the edge of the world, out where the sky starts to bend,
After awhile in the sun, you'll be sleeping, sleeping.

I picture you now ' you are beautiful, you are golden,
Just like you were when you thought no one was looking.
Time will take care of you, love. Time will take care of you, love.
I will take care of you, love, again, again,

Will fall apart

Sur la ville il fait trop chaud

Et regardent par le carreau
Cette fille qui danse à midi

Ainsi certains jours, paraît

Et son chant plane sur la ville
Hymne d'amour et de bonté
Mais sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Et, pour ne point entendre son chant,

Comme une porte entre morts et vivants

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme en nos cœurs

Laisser luire sa lueur

Et nous nous voilons les yeux
